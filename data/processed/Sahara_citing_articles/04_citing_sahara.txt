AB Aim Understanding the patterns and correlates of the range expansion of established alien species is crucial for predicting invasion impacts and developing effective control strategies. With accelerating globalization, it is key to identify the interactions of different global change processes, such as how land-use change may influence range expansion, yet empirical studies remain limited.
   Location Liuji Town, Jiangsu Province, China.
   Methods We first divided the study area into 128 grids with a resolution of 1 x 1 km and conducted visual encounter surveys over two years for a total of 492 water bodies to explore the establishment and range expansions of a global notorious invader, the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus (Shaw, 1802) (= Rana catesbeiana (Shaw, 1802)) using generalized linear mixed models. Then, we investigated the residence time of the established bullfrogs in each water body based on a questionnaire survey. We quantified the habitat loss and range expansion of the past 30 years via GIS-based spatial analysis and explored their temporal dynamics using the breakpoint regression technique.
   Results We found that the area of suitable habitats was the most important variable positively related to the bullfrog establishment. There was a similar temporal trend of the range expansion and habitat loss, although the optimal time of habitat loss was slightly earlier than that of the great increase in bullfrog range expansion. Overall, the bullfrogs tended to expand faster with greater habitat loss after controlling for temporal non-independence.
   Main conclusions Our results demonstrated that loss of suitable habitats may facilitate invaders with faster range expansion to occupy the remaining limited resources. Alien species might thus accelerate invasions under human-induced land-use modifications in the era of global change. The time lag between range expansion and habitat loss is the golden window for preventing the spread of established alien species in disturbed habitats.

AB Sparsely vegetated habitats of cliffs and screes act as refugia for many regional and local endemic specialized plant taxa most of which have evolved precisely for that type of habitat. The interplay between taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional plant diversity on rock and scree habitats of extreme environmental conditions, enlightens the relations of plant communities and ecosystems and facilitates management planning for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The identification of biodiversity patterns and hotspots (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional) contributes to the integration of the ecosystem services (ES) approach for the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services (MAES) implementation in Greece and the creation of thematic maps based on the MAES reporting format. The overlap among the protected areas' network revealed that almost all areas of cliffs and screes of medium, high, and very high taxonomic and phylogenetic plant endemism are included in the Natura 2000 area network. The results of this study provide the baseline information for ES assessments at sparsely vegetated land of cliffs and screes. Our results contribute to the implementation of certain indicators of the national set of MAES indicators in Greece such as (a) floristic diversity and (b) microrefugia of endemic diversity and support of decision-making.

AB Background Fire is an important driver of ecosystem dynamics worldwide. However, knowledge on broad-scale patterns of ecosystem and organism responses to fires is still scarce. Through a systematic quantitative review of available studies across South America, we assessed fire effects on biodiversity and abundance of different organisms (i.e., plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates), plant fitness, and soil properties under four climate types, and time since the last fire (i.e., early and late post fire). We addressed: (1) What fire effects have been studied across South America? (2) What are the overall responses of biodiversity, abundance, fitness, and soil properties to fires? (3) How do climate and time since fire modulate those responses? Results We analyzed 160 articles reporting 1465 fire responses on paired burned and unburned conditions. We found no effect of fire on biodiversity or on invertebrate abundance, a negative effect on woody plant species and vertebrate abundance, and an increase in shrub fitness. Soil in burned areas had higher bulk density and pH, and lower organic matter and nitrogen. Fire effect was significantly more positive at early than at late post fire for plant fitness and for soil phosphorus and available nitrogen. Stronger negative effects in semiarid climate compared to humid warm climate suggest that higher temperatures and water availability allow a faster ecosystem recovery after fire. Conclusions Our review highlights the complexity of the climate-fire-vegetation feedback when assessing the response of soil properties and different organisms at various levels. The resilience observed in biodiversity may be expected considering the large number of fire-prone ecosystems in South America. The recovery of invertebrate abundance, the reduction of the vertebrate abundance, and the loss of nitrogen and organic matter coincide with the responses found in global reviews at early post-fire times. The strength of these responses was further influenced by climate type and post-fire time. Our synthesis provides the first broad-scale diagnosis of fire effects in South America, helping to visualize strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in fire research. It also brings much needed information for developing adequate land management in a continent where fire plays a prominent socio-ecological role.

AB Ecological theory predicts that species interactions embedded in multitrophic networks shape the opportunities for species to persist. However, the lack of experimental support of this prediction has limited our understanding of how species interactions occurring within and across trophic levels simultaneously regulate the maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we integrate a mathematical approach and detailed experiments in plant-pollinator communities to demonstrate the need to jointly account for species interactions within and across trophic levels when estimating the ability of species to persist. Within the plant trophic level, we show that the persistence probability of plant species increases when introducing the effects of plant-pollinator interactions. Across trophic levels, we show that the persistence probabilities of both plants and pollinators exhibit idiosyncratic changes when experimentally manipulating the multitrophic structure. Importantly, these idiosyncratic effects are not recovered by traditional simulations. Our work provides tractable experimental and theoretical platforms upon which it is possible to investigate the multitrophic factors affecting species persistence in ecological communities.

AB Brazil has high levels of biodiversity and has received strong criticism for the increasing country-wide deforestation that threatens it. Although a significant percentage of land area in Brazil is protected, the areas are insufficient and unevenly distributed. Many studies have contributed to the biogeographical knowledge of Brazilian flora, but no endemicity analysis (EA) has been conducted including all endemic angiosperms. We investigated the spatial component, drawing on a huge and taxonomically diverse dataset based on 827 016 records collected over the last two centuries. We conducted an EA for 15 034 species from 173 families using an optimality criterion with 2 degrees and 3 degrees grid sizes, in order to search for distributional concordance, to identify the biogeographical units and discuss the implications for conservation. Six analyses were run for basal angiosperms, monocots and eudicots. The EA recovered 66 consensus areas (CAs). The concordance of CAs enabled the identification of five best-supported areas of endemism--three in the Atlantic and Parana Forest and two areas in the Cerrado province--supported by species of 120 families. The age of divergence for some genera that contributed significantly to the identification of areas recovered in the Cerrado coincides with the recent, <10 Ma, estimated age of that province. By contrast, the areas in the Atlantic and Parana Forest are supported by genera with earlier diversification >30 Ma, supporting an ancient origin. Most areas in the Atlantic Forest are partially superimposed with the limits of the protected areas, however, big gaps were identified in the Cerrado. Protecting Brazilian biomes was at the heart of Brazil's environmental policy. Regrettably, this scenario has radically changed based on misleading divergences in conservation policy. Areas of endemism are pivotal for biodiversity conservation due to the common evolutionary history shared by their endemic taxa. Thus, we hope that these congruent patterns of endemism support the establishment of biodiversity priorities.

AB Simple Summary
   The Covid-19 outbreak has brought about fresh and intensified scrutiny of the wildlife trade, which substantively involves commerce in exotic pets. In response, there have been calls for trade bans involving key components of the global commercial wildlife trade, and some major policy decisions involving trade bans have ensued. Yet, these actions have been criticised, largely based on concerns that they risk exacerbating poverty, undermining human rights, damaging conservation incentives, and otherwise harming sustainable development and conservation efforts. Instead, many critics propose improved regulation of the status quo, with the intention of nurturing a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade. Here, we provide a countering view that draws attention to: (1) why the risks presented by the wildlife trade (to animal welfare, biodiversity, public health, and financial security) are manifold, and cannot be treated with complacency; (2) why the goal of a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade is misleading and unachievable; and (3) why moving towards an end to the commercial trade in wildlife should be our ultimate and more ambitious goal. We hope to stimulate further discussion on this issue both within the sustainability research and policy domains, identifying a path towards consensus on how best to protect wildlife, people, and planet.
   The Covid-19 outbreak has brought about fresh and intensified scrutiny of the wildlife trade, which substantively involves commerce in exotic pets. In response, major policy decisions involving trade bans have ensued, with calls for similar such action to be applied across the trade chain.

Instead, many critics propose improved regulation of the status quo, with the intention of nurturing a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade. Herein, we provide a countering view that outlines how the risks presented by the wildlife trade are becoming increasingly recognised as being both manifold and severe; and raise concerns that the goal of a well-regulated wildlife trade is becoming increasingly exposed as a mirage. We conclude that while pursuing the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (with their focus on poverty alleviation, food security, public health, and conservation) is enduringly vital, a flourishing wildlife trade is not. Given that the exploitation of wildlife, including for the pet trade, has been identified as one of the dominant drivers of biodiversity loss, emergence of zoonotic infectious disease, animal suffering, and financial instability, perpetuating the concept of utilising a regulated wildlife trade as the default approach to protect people and planet is in urgent need of re-evaluation.

AB The karst mountainous area is an ecologically fragile region with prominent human-land contradictions. The resource-environment carrying capacity (RECC) of this region needs to be further clarified. The development of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) provides data sources and processing platform for RECC monitoring. This study analyzed and established the evaluation index system of RECC by considering particularity in the karst mountainous area of Southwest China; processed multisource RS data (Sentinel-2, Aster-DEM and Landsat-8) to extract the spatial distributions of nine key indexes by GIS techniques (information classification, overlay analysis and raster calculation); proposed the methods of index integration and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the RECC by GIS; and took a typical area, Guangnan County in Yunnan Province of China, as an experimental area to explore the effectiveness of the indexes and methods. The results showed that: (1) The important indexes affecting the RECC of karst mountainous area are water resources, tourism resources, position resources, geographical environment and soil erosion environment. (2) Data on cultivated land, construction land, minerals, transportation, water conservancy, ecosystem services, topography, soil erosion and rocky desertification can be obtained from RS data. GIS techniques integrate the information into the RECC results. The data extraction and processing methods are feasible on evaluating RECC. (3) The RECC of Guangnan County was in the mid-carrying level in 2018. The mid-carrying and low-carrying levels were the main types, accounting for more than 80.00% of the total study area. The areas with high carrying capacity were mainly distributed in the northern regions of the northwest-southeast line of the county, and other areas have a low carrying capacity comparatively. The coordination between regional resource-environment status and socioeconomic development is the key to improve RECC. This study explores the evaluation index system of RECC in karst mountainous area and the application of multisource RS data and GIS techniques in the comprehensive evaluation. The methods can be applied in related fields to provide suggestions for data/information extraction and integration, and sustainable development.

AB Questions (a) Do patterns of species diversity and composition differ between plots exposed to high vs. low grazing intensity? (b) Do these differences vary among three regions with different climates, representing a gradient from arid to sub-humid conditions? Location Northeastern Iran. Methods We compared plots intensively grazed by sheep and goat (HG) to plots with low grazing intensity (LG), across three climatic regions: arid, semi-arid and sub-humid. Species diversity (expressed as ShannonH) was compared using linear mixed-effect models. Dissimilarity analysis was used to estimate the compositional heterogeneity of different types of plots, reflecting the differences in species composition. Indicator Species Analysis was used to identify individual species associated with particular types of plots. Results The HG plots had lower values of ShannonHthan LG plots, across all climatic regions. Further, the effect of grazing on species diversity varied between the climatic regions, with the most pronounced differences between the HG and LG plots in the sub-humid region. Although no differences in species diversity were detected between the three climatic regions, compositional heterogeneity was the highest in the sub-humid region and the lowest in the semi-arid region, with the most pronounced differences between the HG and LG plots in the sub-humid region. Indicator Species Analysis showed significant main effects of both climate and grazing on species composition, revealing species that respond to grazing in each of the three climatic regions. Conclusions Overgrazing was detected to reduce the diversity of species in all three climatic regions, even though its effect was most pronounced in the sub-humid region. Therefore, the control of overgrazing or reduction of its intensity appears an effective management tool for protecting species diversity, applicable in areas with different climates.

AB Fertiliser application to restore nutrients lost in the mining process and facilitate early plant establishment and growth is a key step in the restoration of sites disturbed by mining. However, few studies have investigated the effects of different fertiliser types and application methods on mine restoration outcomes, especially in highly biodiverse ecosystems such as the jarrah forest. This forest is a unique, floristically diverse landscape with species adapted to growth on a highly weathered phosphorus impoverished Ferralsol. In this study we investigated the effect of fertiliser type (rock phosphate, single superphosphate, and an NPK fertiliser), application method (top-dressed versus incorporated), and the timing of application (winter vs. summer) on the trajectory of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest restoration following bauxite mining compared to an unfertilised control. All fertilised soil had elevated Colwell-P concentrations (bar rock phosphate) and had considerably less N than found in the native forest, even after N fertilisation. Fertiliser incorporation resulted in a more even distribution of P down the soil profile and increased overall plant growth (as assessed by percentage cover) compared with either top-dressed fertiliser application and no fertiliser, potentially offering better erosion control. In contrast, native species richness was highest in the zero fertiliser and NPK treatments and lowest in the phosphorus incorporation treatments. On average, unfertilised plots had 10 more native species per plot than those fertilised with P only. Fertiliser application also reduced the abundance and cover of Bossiaea ornata and Lomandra spp., both of which are small slow-growing understorey taxa. In contrast, the legume Acacia celastrifolia exhibited a vigorous growth response to fertiliser, with growth being greatest when P (either rock phosphate or SSP) was incorporated. These data suggest that P fertiliser incorporation is a potential strategy to both maximise early plant growth and cover and increase the efficiency of P application. However, if the goal of restoration is to maximise diversity then moderation in P application and using fertilisers that also contain N and K may be appropriate.

AB Aim Biomes can diverge substantially in plant functional traits and disturbance regimens among regions. Given that Neotropical and Afrotropical regions have contrasting histories of the megafauna (because of the Holocene megafaunal extinction in the Neotropics), we hypothesize that they should harbour plants with different traits in relationship to herbivory and fire, especially in savannas. We predicted that herbivory resistance traits should be more prominent in Afrotropical savanna plants and fire resistance in Neotropical savanna plants.
   Location Tropics.
   Time period Not applicable.
   Major taxa studied Angiosperms (woody).
   Methods We compiled data for five key plant functional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum tree height, spinescence and proportion of geoxyles) for forest and savanna woody species from the two distant regions (Afrotropics and Neotropics). We related these data to climate, soil and fire variables and tested predictions for megafauna selection.
   Results Spines and high wood density were more common among Afrotropical than Neotropical savanna species and species from the two forests. Moreover, the Neotropical savanna region contained more geoxyles than the Afrotropical savanna region. Finally, Afrotropical species were taller than Neotropical species. These differences were consistent with our predictions for trait selection by the megafauna, and these patterns did not change when considering climate, soil and fire regimens in the models.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the great potential of these traits for summarizing disturbance strategy axes in tropical woody species and suggest that global variation in plant traits is unlikely to be understood fully without consideration of historical factors, especially the direct and indirect impacts of megafauna.

AB Context Spatial prioritization is an analytical approach that can be used to provide decision support in spatial conservation planning (SCP), and in tasks such as conservation area network design, zoning, planning for impact avoidance or targeting of habitat management or restoration. Methods Based on literature, we summarize the role of connectivity as one component of relevance in the broad structure of spatial prioritization in both marine and terrestrial realms. Results Partially diffuse, directed connectivity can be approximated in Zonation-based multi-criteria SCP by applying hydrodynamic modelling, knowledge on species traits, and information on species occurrences and quality of habitats. Sources and destinations of larvae or propagules can be identified as separate spatial layers and taken into account in full-scale spatial prioritization involving data on biota, as well as economic factors, threats, and administrative constraints. While population connectivity is an important determinant of metapopulation persistence, the importance of marine connectivity depends on species traits and the marine environment studied. At one end of the continuum are species that occupy isolated habitats and have long pelagic larval durations in deeper sea areas with strong directional currents. At the other extreme are species with short pelagic durations that occupy fragmented habitats in shallow topographically complex sea areas with weak and variable currents. Conclusions We conclude that the same objectives, methods, and analysis structures are applicable to both terrestrial and marine spatial prioritization. Marine spatial conservation planning, marine spatial planning, marine zoning, etc., can be implemented using methods originated in the terrestrial realm of planning.

AB Coastal physical processes are essential for the cross-shore transport of meroplanktonic larvae to their benthic adult habitats. To investigate these processes, we released a swarm of novel, trackable, subsurface vehicles, the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorer (M-AUEs), which we programmed to mimic larval depth-keeping behavior. The M-AUE swarm measured a sudden net onshore transport of 30-70 m over 15-20 min, which we investigated in detail. Here, we describe a novel transport mechanism of depth-keeping plankton revealed by these observations. In situ measurements and models showed that, as a weakly nonlinear internal wave propagated through the swarm, it deformed surface-intensified, along-isopycnal background velocities downward, accelerating depth-keeping organisms onshore. These higher velocities increased both the depth-keepers' residence time in the wave and total cross-shore displacement, leading to wave-induced transports twice those of fully Lagrangian organisms and four times those associated with the unperturbed background currents. Our analyses also show that integrating velocity time series from virtual larvae or mimics moving with the flow yields both larger and more accurate transport estimates than integrating velocity time series obtained at a point (Eulerian). The increased cross-shore transport of organisms capable of vertical swimming in this wave/background-current system is mathematically analogous to the increase in onshore transport associated with horizontal swimming in highly nonlinear internal waves. However, the mechanism described here requires much weaker swimming speeds (mm s(-1) vs. cm s(-1)) to achieve significant onshore transports, and meroplanktonic larvae only need to orient themselves vertically, not horizontally.

AB Projected increases in the frequency and severity of drought events are expected to impose changes in the ecology of native forb communities in semi-arid ecosystems. We examined the state of forb communities during, and directly after an extreme drought event across two contrasting land-use types, which included a protected area (high diversity of free roaming wild herbivores) and communal rangeland (long history of intensive cattle grazing) in a semi-arid Lowveld savanna of the Gazankulu area, South Africa. Forb floristic data were collected towards the end of the drought and repeated after the drought release a few months later. Forb community composition was significantly different among land-use types. Community changes were not induced by annual forb emergence alone, but through species-specific dominance shifts, which differed among land-use types. Forb richness, diversity and biomass were equally low at both land-use types and increased significantly after the drought release, although the magnitude of response was much stronger in the protected area, whereas drought contributed to a directional change in the protected area with a complete post-drought turnover in both annual and perennial forb species, much less variability was observed in the communal rangeland, which may suggest long-term effects imposed by land-use history.

AB In aerial wildlife counts, human observers often fail to detect animals. We conducted a multi-species sample-count in Tsavo National Park, Kenya, with traditional rear-seat-observers (RSOs) and an automated 'oblique-camera-count' (OCC) imaging system to compare estimates of 23 wildlife species derived from these two survey methods. An aerial Total Count of elephant, buffalo and giraffe, conducted a month previously, provided a further comparison. In the Tsavo Core (9560 km(2)), which harbours 80% of Tsavo's elephants, the OCC system acquired 81 000 images for interpretation, of which 67 000 were obtained in parallel with RSO-counting along 3004 km of flight line. The Tsavo outer blocks (24 171 km(2)) were surveyed using the OCC system without RSOs to acquire a further 84 000 images. A random sample of 11 553 images were re-interpreted to derive species specific probabilities of detection and correction factors. Using 'Jolly II', non-parametric and Bayesian analyses, and applying correction factors, we demonstrate that the RSOs did not detect 14% of elephants, 60% of giraffe, 48% of zebra and 66% of the large antelopes. For comparison, the Total Count observers did not detect 27% of elephant, 33% of buffalo, 57% of giraffe and 85% of carcasses. The OCC method raises the elephant population estimate to 16 681 +/- 4047 (95% cl) from the 12 722 counted in the Total Count (Z = 1.917, p = .0276). These results suggest that RSO-based methods have significantly undercounted wildlife populations. To align with improved counting methods, previous results need to be re-calibrated.

AB Background: Air travel has never been easier, cheaper or faster, with large volumes of people travelling around the world. These factors increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Little is known, however, about the extent to which airlines provide information to passengers on infection control and measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined the websites of the global commercial passenger airlines to see if they contained information about infection control and prevention of infectious diseases and appraised the clinical usefulness of that information.
   Method: A cross-sectional text-based analysis of the 73 airline websites from the six global commercial passenger airline conglomerates was performed to identify information about infection control and prevention of infectious between July and August 2019.
   Results: Of the 73 airline websites, less than half (n = 35, 28.6%) contained information deemed useful for passengers. While there was a range of general health advice within the websites, there was limited information about infection control and preventing infectious diseases. A minority of websites contained information about vaccination status prior to travel, and to a lesser extent handwashing and hand hygiene, with very few including disease-specific advice or preventive measures.
   Conclusions: Airline websites are an underutilised source of information for infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases. Providing passengers with information on basic infection control and prevention measures may support the global efforts against the spread of infectious diseases.

AB Intertidal and shallow subtidal molluscs are highly sensitive to overharvesting because of their restricted habitat, limited mobility and easy access to humans. Several parameters have been previously used to determine their exploitation status, e.g. sizes, abundances and reproductive stages. Herein the reproductive parameters of two exploited limpets, Patella candei and the protandrous hermaphrodite Patella aspera were examined. Limpets were collected "before" (1996-2006) and "after" (2007-2017) the implementation of management measures aiming to preserve limpet populations in Madeira Island (NE Atlantic Ocean). The proportion of reproductive individuals increased approximately 14% after the implementation of management measures for both species. An increase in the size and age at first maturity of both species (from 34.6 to 37.5 mm in P. aspera and from 33.4 to 37.4 mm in P. candei) also occurred after such implementation. "Before" samples of P. aspera showed male biased populations (1.7:1) shifting towards a balanced sex ratio (1:1) after the regulations. No "before" nor "after" sex ratio variations were observed in P. candei populations. Reproductive parameters revealed feasible to determine the efficiency of the implementation of management measures and to detect a slight improvement in reproductive potential of both limpet species.

AB When more than one closely related plant species share the same pollination niche, reproductive interference via interspecific pollen transfer should limit their coexistence. However, some studies have reported the sympatric coexistence of two native close relatives pollinated by the same pollinators under reproductive interference, even without niche partitioning. We examined the frequency dependency of reproductive interference between close relatives in natural conditions and the potential roles of autonomous selfing in mitigating the negative reproductive interference effects between congeneric species. We investigated sympatrically growing Commelina communis (Cc) and C. c. f. ciliata (Ccfc) populations. These species exhibit very large overlaps in habitat preference, flowering phenology and pollination niche, but seldom produce hybrids. First, we conducted a hand-pollination experiment to examine the negative effects of heterospecific pollen deposition on seed production and the potential of self-pollination to mitigate the effects in both species. Then, we examined the effects of reproductive interference on reproductive success and the potential for autonomous selfing in the field. We found significant negative effects of heterospecific pollen deposition on seed production and the mitigation effects of prior and competing self-pollination, in both Cc and Ccfc. For both species in the field, intraspecific pollinator movements and reproductive success significantly decreased with an increase in the relative floral abundance of competing species, although the negative reproductive interference effect on reproductive success was lower in Cc than in Ccfc. We also found greater potential for prior autonomous selfing in Cc than in Ccfc. Our findings suggest that Cc flowers were less affected by reproductive interference from competing species, which was likely due to a higher prior selfing ability compared to Ccfc flowers. The asymmetry in susceptibility to reproductive interference may explain the Cc-biased distribution in the study area. The study improves our understanding of how prior autonomous selfing can reduce the negative reproductive interference effect from competing species in mixed-mating species with frequent pollinator visits.

AB Worldwide, anthropogenic change is causing biodiversity loss, disrupting many critical ecosystem functions. Most studies investigating the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning focus on species richness, predominantly within the context of productivity-related functions. Consequently, there is limited understanding of how other biodiversity measures, such as species evenness (the distribution of abundance among species), affect complex multitrophic functions such as pollination. We explore the effect of species evenness on the ecosystem function of pollination using a controlled experiment with selected plants and insects in flight cages. We manipulated the relative abundances of plant and pollinator species, while holding species richness, composition, dominance order, and total abundance constant. Then, we tested how numerical species evenness affected network structure and consequently, seed production, in our artificial communities. Contrary to our expectation, numerical dominance in plant communities increased complementarity in pollinator use (reduced pollinator sharing) among plant species. As predicted by theory, this increased complementarity resulted in higher seed production for the most dominant and rare plant species in our cages. Our results show that in a controlled experiential setting, numerical species evenness can alter important aspects of plant-pollinator networks and plant reproduction, irrespective of species richness, composition, and total abundance. Extending this understanding of how species evenness affects ecosystem functioning to natural systems is crucial as anthropogenic disturbances continue to alter species' abundances, likely disrupting ecosystem functions long before extinctions occur.

AB Experiments testing multiple factors that affect the rate of invasions in forests are scarce. We aimed to assess how the biomass of invasive Prunus serotina changed over eight years and how this change was affected by light availability, tree stand growth, and propagule pressure. The study was conducted in Siemianice Experimental Forest (W Poland), a common garden forest experiment with 14 tree species. We investigated aboveground biomass and density of P. serotina within 53 experimental plots with initial measurements in 2005 and repeated in 2013. We also measured light availability and distance from seed sources. We used generalized additive models to assess the impact of particular predictors on P. serotina biomass in 2013 and its relative change over eight years. The relative biomass increments of P. serotina ranged from 0 to 22,000-fold. The success of P. serotina, expressed as aboveground biomass and biomass increment, varied among different tree species stands, but was greater under conifers. Total biomass of P. serotina depended on light and propagule availability while biomass increment depended on the change in tree stand biomass, a metric corresponding to tree stand maturation. Our study quantified the range of invasion intensity, expressed as biomass increment, in a forest common garden experiment with 14 tree species. Canopy cover was the most important variable to reduce susceptibility to invasion by P. serotina. Even a modest decrease of overstory biomass, e.g. caused by dicback of coniferous species, may be risky in areas with high propagule pressure from invasive tree species. Thus, P. serotina control may include maintaining high canopy closure and supporting natural regeneration of tree species with high leaf area index, which shade the understory.

AB The identity and relevance of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal partners of Eucalyptus globulus was investigated in NW Spain, to detect which symbionts mainly support its invasiveness. Root tips of E. globulus and of three common native plant species (Quercus robur, Pinus pinaster and Halimium lasianthum) were collected in eucalypt plantations, Q. robur forests, P. pinaster plantations and shrublands. Fungal taxonomical identity was ascertained by use of rDNA and direct sequencing. We studied diversity, composition and colonization rate of the ECM fungal communities of E. globulus to determine if fungal assemblages are host specific (i.e. similar in different habitats) or more dependent on the neighbourhood context. We also identified the type of associations formed (i.e. co-introductions, familiar or novel associations). Twenty-six ECM taxa were associated with E. globulus. Most of them engaged in novel associations with eucalypts, whereas only three fungal species were co-introduced Australian aliens. Eucalypt fungal richness, diversity and colonization rate differed between habitats, being higher in native oak forests, whereas in shrublands E. globulus showed the lowest colonization rate and diversity. The Australian fungus Descolea maculata dominated the eucalypt fungal assemblage and also spread to the native host plants, in all the habitats, posing the risk of further co-invasion.

AB Invasive Alien Species (IAS) pose a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. Even if preventing biological invasions should be the most cost-effective way to minimise the impact of IAS on biodiversity, new efforts are necessary to identify early signs of invasion and to assess invasion risk. In this context, the implementation of invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDMs) could represent a sound instrument that merits further research. Acacia saligna is an Australian vascular plant introduced into Europe during the last half century and is one of the most aggressive IAS in the Mediterranean basin.
   In this work, we model the occurrence of A. saligna in the coastal landscapes of central Italy (Adriatic coast) while accounting for the simultaneous effect of multiple factors (propagule pressure, abiotic, biotic factors). The iSDM for A. saligna was implemented on a representative tract of the Adriatic coast in central Italy (Molise region), largely included in two Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites which actively contribute to the description of the considered ecosystem status and possible future trends. By using a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) with a binomial distribution of errors based on field and cartographic geo-referenced data, we examined the statistical relationship between the occurrence of A. whoa and a comprehensive set of environmental factors. The iSDM effectively captured the role of the different vari ables in determining the occurrence of A. saligna in the coastal dunes. Its occurrence is primarily related to Wooded dunes with Pinus pinea and/or P. pinaster (EU Habitat 2270) and distance from the sea and, to a lesser extent, with distance from roads and rivers. This research provides a first exploratory analysis of the environmental characteristics that promote the rapid growth and development of A. saligna in Italian dune ecosystems, identifying the habitats that are mainly affected by the invasive process in coastal areas and, by doing so, contributing to filling the gap between theory and practice in conservation decisionmaking. Finally, the LTER network benefitted from this research, confirming its relevance in providing useful information for modelling and monitoring invasion processes.

AB Lobsters have an open circulatory system with haemolymph that contains microorganisms even in the healthy individuals. Understanding the role of these microorganisms becomes increasingly important particularly for the diagnosis of disease as the closed life-cycle aquaculture of the spiny lobster Panulirus ornatus nears commercial reality. This study aimed to characterise haemolymph responses of healthy cultured P. ornatus juveniles at control (28 degrees C) and elevated (34 degrees C) temperatures. This was assessed by measuring immune parameters (total granulocyte counts, total haemocyte counts, clotting times), and culture-independent (pyrosequencing of haemolymph DNA) and culture-dependent (isolation using nonselective growth medium) techniques to analyse bacterial communities from lobster haemolymph sampled on days 0, 4 and 6 post-exposure to the temperature regimes. Elevated temperature (34 degrees C) affected lobster survival, total granulocyte counts, and diversity, load and functional potential of the haemolymph bacterial community. Pyrosequencing analyses showed that the core haemolymph microbiome consisted of phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes. Overall, culture-independent methods captured a higher bacterial diversity and load when compared to culture-dependent methods, however members of the Rhodobacteraceae were strongly represented in both analyses. This is the first comprehensive study providing comparisons of haemolymph bacterial communities from healthy and thermally stressed cultured juvenile P. ornatus and has the potential to be used in health monitoring programs.

AB Biotic interactions are central to the development of theory and concepts in community ecology; experimental evidence has shown their strong effects on patterns of population and community organization and dynamics over local spatial scales. The role of competition in determining range limits and preventing invasions at biogeographic scales is more controversial, partly because of the complexity of processes involved in species colonization of novel habitats and the difficulties in performing appropriate manipulations and controls. We examined experimentally whether competition is likely to affect poleward range expansion hindering or facilitating the establishment of the limpet Scurria viridula along the south-eastern Pacific rocky shore (30 degrees S, Chile) in the region occupied by the congeneric S. zebrina. We also assessed whether competition with the "invader" or range-expanding species could reduce individual performance of the "native" S. zebrina and depress local populations Geographic field surveys were conducted to characterize the abundance and identity of limpets along the south-eastern Pacific coast from 18 degrees S to 41 degrees S, and the micro-scale (few cm) spatial distribution across the range overlap of the two species. Field-based competition experiments were conducted at the southern leading edge of the range of S. viridula (33 degrees S) and at the northern limit of S. zebrina (30 degrees S). Field surveys showed poleward range expansion of S. viridula of ca. 210 km since year 2000, with an expansion rate of 13.1 km/year. No range shift was detected for S. zebrina. The resident S. zebrina had significant negative effects on the growth rate of the invading juvenile S. viridula, while no effect of the latter was found on S. zebrina. Spatial segregation between species was found at the scale of cms. Our results provide novel evidence of an asymmetric competitive effect of a resident species on an invader, which may hamper further range expansion. No negative effect of the invader on the resident species was detected. This study highlights the complexities of evaluating the role of species interactions in setting range limits of species, but showed how interspecific competition might slow the advance of an invader by reducing individual performance and overall population size at the advancing front.

AB Demonstrating sustainable land management (SLM) requires an understanding of the linkages between grazing management and environmental stewardship. Grazing management practices that incorporate strategic periods of rest are promoted internationally as best practice. However, spatial and temporal trends in unmanaged feral (goat) and native (kangaroo) populations in the southern Australian rangelands can result land managers having, at times, control over less than half the grazing pressure, precluding the ability to rest pastures. Few empirical studies have examined the impacts of total grazing pressure (TGP) on biodiversity and resource condition, while the inability to manage grazing intensity at critical times may result in negative impacts on ground cover, changes in pasture species composition, increased rates of soil loss and reduce the ability for soils to store carbon. The widespread adoption of TGP control through exclusion fencing in the southern Australian rangelands has created unprecedented opportunities to manage total grazing pressure, although there is little direct evidence that this infrastructure leads to more sustainable land management. Here we identify several key indicators that are either outcome- or activity-based that could serve as a basis for verification of the impacts of TGP management. Since TGP is the basic determinant of the impact of herbivory on vegetation it follows that the ability for rangeland pastoral management to demonstrate SLM and environmental stewardship will rely on using evidence-based indicators to support environmental social licence to operate.

AB Tierberg-LTER is a research site established in 1987 in the semi-arid Succulent Karoo near Prince Albert in the Western Cape province, South Africa. The original purpose for its establishment was to study ecosystem dynamics and the drivers of vegetation in the context of historical land use. The large body of work that has materialised from Tierberg-LTER is grounded on extensive baseline data and has greatly influenced the broader Karoo literature. It stands as the only long-term ecological research facility for the semi-arid region of South Africa. The Karoo environment faces several new developments centred largely on the expanding energy sector. Under a changing climate, ecosystems will have to further adapt to the impacts of such developments. The future research programme for Tierberg-LTER will accordingly continue to focus on understanding Karoo ecosystem dynamics and drivers of climate and anthropogenic change at local scales, thereby informing management and mitigation of future development impacts. Among a growing network of Karoo research sites, Tierberg-LTER maintains a unique role for long-term and intensive research that will contribute significantly towards the South African Environmental Observation Network's vision of furthering ecosystem integrity, societal prosperity and sustainable development.

AB Studies of ecosystem responses to climate change often focus on potential equilibria in species or community distributions, overlooking the transitions to new equilibrium states. Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant-herbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant-herbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients.

AB Little is known about the impacts of diet and environment on the composition and stability of gut microbial assemblages among freshwater macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups, compared to terrestrial counterparts. In this study, we compared gut microbial assemblages among functional feeding groups and environmental/dietary materials (biofilm and bacterioplankton) within and across two Northeastern Ohio streams differing in environmental conditions, following partial 16S rRNA sequence data analyses. Four functional feeding groups (filter feeders, grazers/collectors, omnivores, and predators) were uncovered in both streams, with significant differences in gut microbial community compositions among functional feeding groups within streams, and significant similarities in gut microbial community compositions between the same functional feeding groups across streams. Observed differences and similarities among functional feeding groups may be attributed to group-specific internal sorting processes due to physical and chemical properties (such as pH and oxygen levels) of the gut, which impact successful bacterial colonization. Results from this study provide insights into the impacts of diet and environment on the composition and stability of freshwater macroinvertebrate gut microbial assemblages. Results also provide a basis for further studies investigating initial establishment and colonization of gut microbiota across developmental stages, and potential gut microbial functions of importance to freshwater macroinvertebrate hosts.

AB The conservation of biodiverse areas around the world has contributed to the protection and recovery of endangered species. This has been the case for 11 species of Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) that today are successfully maintained over six islands: Espanola, Santiago, Pinzon, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz. A favourable state of conservation will depend however on future development in the islands. In Santa Cruz Island the development of the agricultural areas has encroached on the migratory routes of the southwestern species C. porteri and may be an emergent conflict for tortoise conservation. We investigated the social and ecological inter-linkages using two methods framed under a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach: semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to study farmers' perceptions and attitudinal factors regarding giant tortoises; as well as the associated socio-economic impacts of the conflict. Moreover, we coupled the PRA approach with an ecological assessment of giant tortoises' population density by performing transect counts during the two yearly phases of giant tortoises' migration to the lowlands (January to June) and back to the highlands (July to December). Our results indicate that farmers reporting damage and cultivating crops have higher odds of taking actions (fencing and physical actions) towards giant tortoises; regardless of having (or not) a negative perception towards the species. The economic losses for crops and fences averaged 2.8 USD/m(2) and 13USD/m, respectively, and provide an initial step to further analyse and characterise the direct and indirect damage costs. Finally, we estimated a density of 76 and 185 individuals of giant tortoises per km(2) in the rural area for the lowland and highland migratory phases, respectively. Our approach provides grounded scientific social and ecological information to effectively inform and aid managers, policy and decision makers in the selection of adequate social and ecological criteria to implement the best available options in the resolution of this emergent conservation conflict.

AB Two Ponto-Caspian amphipods, Dikerogammarus villosus and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, have expanded their geographical ranges from eastern Europe into Great Britain in recent years. This study represents one of the first examining the distribution and habitat preferences of coexisting populations of D. haemobaphes and D. villosus via field and laboratory experiments in the UK. Field surveys of a recently invaded lowland reservoir in the UK are complimented with ex situ laboratory mesocosm experiments examining the substrate preferences of coexisting populations of D. villosus and D. haemobaphes. Results from the field study indicated that D. haemobaphes dominated the macroinvertebrate community within the reservoir and demonstrated a strong affinity for large cobble and artificial substrates. D. villosus occurred at lower abundances but displayed a strong preference for coarse cobble substrates. A third invasive amphipod, Crangonyx pseudogracilis, was largely confined to sand/silt habitats. Laboratory mesocosm experiments clearly supported the field observations of D. villosus and D. haemobaphes with both species demonstrating a preference for cobble substrates. Results from the study highlight the importance of characterising physical habitat when investigating biological invasions and suggest that habitat availability may influence the extent and speed at which range expansion of new amphipod invaders occurs.

TI Can trackers count free-ranging wildlife as effectively and efficiently

AB Estimating wildlife abundance is central to conservation. We compared two widely practiced standards for counting animals - aerial strip surveys and ground line transects - with interpreted counts of animal tracks. At equal sampling intensity in semiarid savanna with good visibility all three methods produced similar population estimates and precision for six large herbivores. This comparison adds empirical support for the use of track count data to estimate population density rather than being restricted to ambiguous indices of relative abundance. Although expected to capture more species than aerial surveys, we found line transects limiting because encounter rates by direct sightings were relatively low; a minimum threshold 40 observations was achieved for only 1/3 of antelope species in 648.4 km of transect. By contrast, animal track counts returned exceedingly high encounter rates that allowed estimation of abundance for the entire large predator-prey community and mapping density-distributions more completely. Unlike aerial surveys conducted by Botswana's wildlife authority, the track survey provided opportunity to involve local people in the research process. The track survey cost 40% less than the aerial survey, and could be reduced a further 3-fold if trackers collected data autonomously without motor vehicles. Counting animals by their tracks is ultimately constrained to regions with appropriate substrates. However, in suitable environments like the Kalahari, we suggest that a citizen science driven by expert local trackers could ultimately replace conventional wildlife counts, generating knock-on benefits to conservation beyond improved data.

AB Seabird colonies alter the biogeochemistry of nearby ecosystems, while the associated emissions of ammonia (NH3) may cause acidification and eutrophication of finely balanced biomes. To examine the possible effects of future climate change on the magnitude and distribution of seabird NH3 emissions globally, a global seabird database was used as input to the GUANO model, a dynamic mass-flow process-based model that simulates NH3 losses from seabird colonies at an hourly resolution in relation to environmental conditions. Ammonia emissions calculated by the GUANO model were in close agreement with measured NH3 emissions across a wide range of climates. For the year 2010, the total global seabird NH3 emission is estimated at 82 [37-127] Gg year(-1). This is less than previously estimated using a simple temperature-dependent empirical model, mainly due to inclusion of nitrogen wash-off from colonies during precipitation events in the GUANO model. High precipitation, especially between 40 degrees and 60 degrees S, results in total emissions for the penguin species that are 82% smaller than previously estimated, while for species found in dry tropical areas, emissions are 83-133% larger. Application of temperature anomalies for several IPCC scenarios for 2099 in the GUANO model indicated a predicted net increase in global seabird NH3 emissions of 27% (B1 scenario) and 39% (A2 scenario), compared with the 2010 estimates. At individual colonies, the net change was the result of influences of temperature, precipitation and relative humidity change, with smaller effects of wind-speed changes. The largest increases in NH3 emissions (mean: 60% [486 to -50] increase; A2 scenario for 2099 compared with 2010) were found for colonies 40 degrees S to 65 degrees N, and may lead to increased plant growth and decreased biodiversity by eliminating nitrogen sensitive plant species. Only 7% of the seabird colonies assessed globally (mainly limited to the sub-polar Southern Ocean) were estimated to experience a reduction in NH3 emission (average: -18% [-50 to 0] reduction between 2010 and 2099, A2 scenario), where an increase in precipitation was found to more than offset the effect of rising temperatures.

AB The conservation of habitat types has been recognized to be of relevant importance for the conservation of biodiversity and is a major concern in the European Union. With the 92/43/EEC Habitats Directive, the European Commission targeted these habitat types, which conservation must be ensured by Member States. In this context, the Habitat type 9330 "Quercus suber forests" is intended to ensure the conservation of cork oak woodlands in Europe. To support the enhancement of nature conservation policies, in this study we provide a classification of cork oak woodlands in Europe using a large vegetation database. We identify four major groups with clear biogeographic differences and characterize them by lists of indicator species. We also provide distribution maps based on occurrence data and the modelled potential area of distribution as an additional tool for conservation. This study offers a contribution to the comparative description of the European Q. suber woodlands subtypes and to establish a protocol for habitat monitoring and assessment.

AB Wormlions are sit-and-wait insect predators that construct pit-traps to capture arthropod prey. They require loose soil and shelter from direct sun, both common in Mediterranean cities, and explaining their high abundance in urban habitats. We studied different aspects of thermal acclimation in wormlions. We compared chill-coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat-shock recovery time (HSRT) of wormlions from urban, semi-urban and natural habitats, expecting those originating from the urban habitat to be more heat tolerant and less cold tolerant. However, no differences were detected among the three habitats. We then examined whether maintenance temperature affects CCRT and HSRT, and expected beneficial acclimation. However, CCRT was unaffected by maintenance temperature, while temperature affected HSRT in an opposite direction to our prediction: wormlions maintained under the higher temperatures took longer to recover. When testing with two successive thermal shocks, wormlions took longer to recover from both cold and heat shock after applying an initial cold shock. We therefore conclude that cold shock inflicts some damage rather than induces acclimation. Finally, both cold- and heat-shocked wormlions constructed smaller pits than wormlions of a control group. Smaller pits probably translate to a lower likelihood of capturing prey and also limit the size of the prey, indicating a concrete cost of thermal shock. In summary, we found no evidence for thermal acclimation related either to the habitat-of-origin or to maintenance temperatures, but, rather, negative effects of unfavorable temperatures.

AB Large marine regions, including the exceptionally productive Southern Ocean, are iron-limited. As a result, there has been substantial interest in iron-fertilizing high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) areas in an effort to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide. More recently, research has shifted to quantifying the beneficial effects of iron recycling by marine biota. Marine top predators such as whales and seabirds have been examined specifically in this regard as they have high biomass, form dense aggregations, and excrete bioavailable iron in concentrations seven orders of magnitude higher than ambient seawater. Despite it being well established that marine fauna link the iron and carbon cycles, the connection of this process to the sulfur cycle has rarely been considered. The chemoattraction of specific marine fauna to algal-derived dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is key in triggering dense, multi-species foraging aggregations that induce iron recycling, augmenting carbon assimilation. The goal of this paper is twofold; first, to highlight DMS chemoattraction as a behavior that catalyzes carbon sequestration via natural iron fertilization, and second, to identify knowledge gaps that recent biogeochemical advances can address.

AB During breeding, seabirds are central place foragers and are sensitive to changes in local prey availability. As the breeding season progresses, foraging behavior and distribution is expected to change in response to possible changes in local prey availability. In addition, adult gender, and the increasing nutritional demands of a growing chick may also influence the foraging behavior of individuals. At present, relatively few studies have assessed the foraging behavior of adult birds during the late post-guard stages of chick rearing. Through a combination of GPS tracking and diet sampling we investigated the foraging distances, spatial distribution, and prey composition of adult Cape gannets (Morus capensis) during the guard and post-guard stages of chick rearing. We found no clear evidence for consistent sex-specific differences in foraging distances and spatial distribution during the guard stage, although marginal differences in the location of core foraging areas during the post-guard stage were apparent. Results, however, revealed a clear increase in foraging range from the early guard to the late post-guard stage of chick rearing. During December the diet was comprised almost exclusively of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), the proportion of which had decreased significantly in the diet by January. This was mirrored by a substantial increase in the proportion of saury (Scomberesox saurus). These results suggest that Cape gannets show flexibility in the foraging behavior and diet, which may be related to changes in the abundance and distribution of prey or may reflect changes in the energetic requirements of the growing offspring. This study provides the first assessment of Cape gannet foraging behavior and spatial distribution during the post-guard stage of chick rearing. The importance of considering intra-annual variability in foraging distribution when using seabird tracking data in trophic and marine spatial planning studies are highlighted.

AB One of the recurrent themes in historical biogeography relates to the units of analysis, their definition and identification. Although areas of endemism are usually accepted as the standard units of study, other units have been suggested, as well as several methods for identifying them. There is no consensus on which units are best suited for the studies; however, the effect of the units and area schemes on analytical results is acknowledged. Here, I review the literature on biogeographic units, their uses and recommendations, highlighting the relevance of the use of more than one area-classification scheme in empirical studies.

AB The South African coastline has been invaded by numerous alien species. Rare pre-invasion (1980) and post-invasion datasets (2001 and 2012) exist for Marcus Island, a small land-tied island in Saldanha Bay, South Africa. These snapshot datasets of the island's intertidal invertebrate community were complemented with monitoring across seasons, from 2014 to 2016. Invertebrate communities were compared among the summers of 1980, 2001, 2012, 2014. 2015 and 2016 to assess interannual differences, while invertebrates and algae were monitored quarter-annually to assess seasonal changes. In addition, the population dynamics of the alien mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis were monitored. Differences in invertebrate communities between consecutive summers were significant but much smaller than changes induced by the arrival of alien species. Invertebrate and seaweed communities differed among years and shore zones but not among seasons, whereas species diversity differed among years, seasons and shore zones, with zones having the strongest influence. The invasion by M. galloproyincialis, and ensuing spatial and temporal variability in its recruitment, emerged as the most important factor influencing community composition, overshadowing interannual and seasonal changes. This work highlights that the impacts of alien species can be distinguished from natural variability by combining long-term monitoring with surveys at finer temporal scales. This is an important step in extending our understanding of the impacts of marine alien species.

AB Validating and improving field-sampling techniques for estimating wildlife community composition and population size is essential for wildlife management and conservation. We conducted ground distance sampling surveys along line transects and block counts from a small aircraft in Manyara Ranch in Northern Tanzania and contrasted estimates of species richness and species-specific densities from both sampling techniques. We used regression analyses (logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models) and model selection to investigate whether a species' body size, group size, body color, as well as vegetation cover explained the variation in species presence/absence and relative density differences in aerial vs. ground-based sampling. Ground surveys detected significantly more species than aerial surveys. However, aerial surveys detected three species that were missed by ground surveys (African lions, African buffalo, and spotted hyena). Model selection suggested that species with smaller body mass and small group sizes were more likely to be missed in aerial surveys. Densities estimated from the aerial surveys were generally but non-significantly lower than the densities estimated from the ground surveys, with the exception of density estimates for African elephants which were slightly higher from aerial surveys. Density differences between the two methods were greater for species with small group size, light body color, and in areas with denser vegetation cover; these variables explained 75% of the variation in density differences between the two survey methods. Albeit being similar in operational costs in our relatively small study area, ground surveys yielded (1) more complete information with respect to wildlife community composition and (2) density estimates were mostly higher and (3) more precise and (4) appear more feasible to be implemented in community-based conservation schemes.

AB The breeding period has a critical influence on the trophic ecology of seabirds because of the energetic costs of egg production for females, the need to return regularly to the nest to provision chicks, the combined energetic demands of adults and chicks, and potential intraspecific competition if resources around the colony are scarce. The present study combined three dietary methods to investigate if and how these intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced diet specialization in a colonially breeding seabird, the Cape gannet Morus capensis. The diet of this species was studied from November 2009 to October 2010 at the species' largest colony at Bird Island, Algoa Bay (33(degrees)50'S, 026 degrees 17'E; South Africa). Potential prey species were sampled concurrently and dietary tracers (stable isotopes and fatty acids) were analysed. Stomach content and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses indicated that adults relied heavily all year round on small pelagic fish (anchovy and sardine), with prey species composition and individual prey size changing with season, probably reflecting prey biology. Dietary tracers did not show any differences between adult and chick diets. Subtle differences were found between stable isotope values of adult males and females but these were not supported by a Bayesian mixing model. In contrast, differences between the sexes were highlighted in blood fatty acids. The combined results suggest that these were probably related to the cost of egg production rather than to inter-sex differences in diet. Individual diet specialization was observed using stable isotopes in adults. Altogether this dataset indicates the importance of combining complementary methods to understand multiple facets of seabirds' trophic ecology, and highlights interactions with fisheries that require future monitoring.

AB Environmental heterogeneity contributes to various habitats and may influence the diversity and activity patterns of wildlife among habitats. We used camera traps to assess wildlife habitat use in Guanyinshan Nature Reserve from 2009 to 2012. We focused on four types of habitat including open areas with gentle slope (< 15A degrees) (Type1), low elevation areas (about 1500-1700 m) with high bamboo coverage (Type2), high elevation areas (about 2100-2300 m) with high canopy coverage (Type3), and wildlife migration passages (Type4). We analyzed the differences in species richness, relative abundance index (RAI), species diversity, and animals' activity pattern among habitats. Total six species were analyzed on activity pattern, which are Takin (Budorcas taxicolor), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral), wild boar (Sus scrofa), golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus), and porcupine (Hystrix hodgsoni). The results are (1) that there were significant differences in richness and RAI(t) among habitats; (2) Type4 habitat had the highest richness and RAI(t) while Type2 had the highest species diversity; giant pandas were found in these two habitats; (3) there were significant differences in species' activity during daytime and nighttime; and (4) differences appeared in habitat preference of the most abundant species. Takin and tufted deer preferred Type1, Himalayan goral preferred Type2, and golden pheasant preferred Type3. Type4 habitat was used by most animals. All these revealed that habitat heterogeneity plays an important role in species diversity and the importance for conservation.

AB Mexico has the fifth place among megadiverse countries, and the southern part of the country belongs to the Mesoamerican hotspot, where Oaxaca state has a very rich flora, related to its intricate topography. In this study, a multicriteria analysis (species richness, rareness, irreplaceability, turnover, and vulnerability) was used to prioritize conservation areas in Oaxaca, using as model system the genus Quercus (oaks), due to its high diversity and ecological importance. Our results indicate that the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca (SMOax) is the physiographic subprovince with the highest richness (38 species), rareness and irreplaceability of Quercus species, followed by the Montanas y Valles del Occidente (MVO; 29 species), the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS; 25 species), and the Montanas y Valles del Centro (20 species). Areas that have retained most primary vegetation cover from 2000 to 2010 are mainly in the SMOax, in the Ixtlan district, and in the SMS, in the Miahuatlan district. On the other hand, MVO is the area with greater habitat disturbance, mainly in the Juxtlahuaca-Tlaxiaco districts. Oaxaca has numerous areas without official protection, named Indigenous Conservation and Community Areas, which play a central role as an alternative for conservation for 11 oak species. In conclusion, the priority conservation areas for the genus are mainly located in the SMOax and in the SMS. For white oaks, the semiarid area of Coixtlahuaca-Teposcolula-Nochitlan is important, while for the red oaks, the most important regions are the humid areas of Teotitlan, Sola de Vega, and Miahuatlan.

AB Weierstrassian Levy walks are the archetypical form of random walk that do not satisfy the central limit theorem and are instead characterized by scale invariance. They were originally regarded as a mathematical abstraction but subsequent theoretical studies showed that they can, in principle, at least, be generated by chaos. Recently, Weierstrassian Levy walks have been found to provide accurate representations of the movement patterns of mussels (Mytilus edulis) and mud snails (Hydrobia ulvae) recorded in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Here, we tested whether Weierstrassian Levy walks and chaos are present under natural conditions in intertidal limpets Patella vulgata and P. rustica, and found that both characteristics are pervasive. We thereby show that Weierstrassian Levy walks may be fundamental to how molluscs experience and interact with the world across a wide range of ecological contexts. We also show in an easily accessible way how chaos can produce a wide variety of Weierstrassian Levy walk movement patterns. Our findings support the Levy flight foraging hypothesis that posits that because Levy walks can optimize search efficiencies, natural selection should have led to adaptations for Levy walks.

AB Wildlife managers use a variety of interventions to alter species distributions but it is uncertain how effective these techniques will be under shifting climate. There is growing recognition of the importance of including climate change scenarios into management planning and actions, but this is lacking in many systems. The spatially-explicit ecosystem model, SAVANNA, was used to predict shifts in large herbivore distribution from 2020 to 2079 under scenarios of climate change, water management, and elephant population growth in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Directional persistence was used to indicate where five large herbivore species elephant (Loxodonta africana), buffalo (Syncerus coffer), impala (Aepyceros melampus), wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), and zebra (Equus quagga) were predicted to increase or decrease their density relative to historic conditions. The overlap in herbivore distributions both within and between species was measured to indicate which change agents were likely to influence future distributions as well as when those influences are expected to occur. We found that patterns differed across climate scenarios. Altering artificial water availability had a mixed overall effect on the persistence of herbivore densities across the park, but strongly influenced the overlap in both within- and between species distributions. Elephant numbers generally only had an influence under the most extreme case of population growth. While management actions at the scale of large protected areas or regions may not be able to directly alter climate outcomes, they have the potential to mitigate other stressors, increasing the opportunity for species and ecosystems to adapt to uncertain climate effects. Simulation studies of future conditions under interacting climate and management, such as presented here, have important potential to inform decision making, but do not remove the need for continued monitoring and adaptive management.

AB Environmental heterogeneity across savanna landscapes, including different seasonal resources at different distances to water, may play a critical role in maintaining the size and diversity of wildlife populations and the sustainability of their resource base. We investigated whether extensive landscapes with functionally diverse seasonal resources and large waterless regions can mediate the effect of herbivory on plant composition, structure and diversity. Vegetation composition, structure and richness in two different vegetation types (mopane and sandveld woodland) at three distance zones (0 km -5 km, 10 km -15 km and > 20 km) from the permanent water of the Okavango Delta and Linyanti Swamps were surveyed. We modelled vegetation response of the most abundant species to herbivory in relation to distance from permanent water, and included fire frequency as a covariate. Trees favoured by elephants during the dry season occurred typically as immature, pollarded populations within 5 km of permanent water sources while mature tall populations of these species were found far from water (> 10 km -15 km). Similarly, short high-quality grazing grasses were higher in abundance within 5 km of permanent water, whereas taller high-quality perennial grasses peaked in abundance beyond 20 km from permanent water. Trends in herbaceous richness with distance from water were contingent upon vegetation type, while tree richness did not change with distance from water. Spatial refuges in waterless regions of landscapes facilitate the creation of heterogeneity of vegetation structure, composition and richness by large herds of mammalian herbivores. Therefore, the extension of herbivore dry season foraging range, for example, by the creation of artificial water points (AWP) in backcountry woodlands, could seriously undermine the resilience of landscapes to herbivory by reducing the availability of spatial refuges. Consequently, it reduces the resilience of herbivore and predator populations that depend on these spatial refuges. We strongly advise that future scientific work, and management and policy actions should be focused on the identification and sustaining of these spatial refuges in wildlife areas.
   Conservation implications: Management and policy actions should be focused on the identification and sustainability of spatial refuges in wildlife areas. Too many AWP in backcountry woodlands could undermine the resilience of landscapes to herbivory by reducing the proportion of landscapes beyond 15 km from permanent water.

AB The success of the invasive Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, stems partly from its ability to exclude established crab species from preferred rocky and cobble intertidal habitat. Here, we assessed preference and competition for habitat types (cobble vs. sand) for H. sanguineus and two competitor species; the previous invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the native rock crab, Cancer irroratus, in New England. In simple laboratory experiments, we paired similarly sized heterospecifics and conspecifics from each species, and also grouped combinations of C. maenas and H. sanguineus in a series of four-individual sets in order to dissect the outcome of intra- and inter-specific competition at different densities. Individually, all three species preferred cobble substrate. With paired conspecifics, H. sanguineus individuals would cohabitate in cobble, whereas C. maenas and C. irroratus individuals each excluded conspecifics from cobble. In heterospecific pairs, H. sanguineus excluded both C. maenas and C. irroratus from cobble. C. maenas and C. irroratus, were equally likely to exclude the other species, but rarely excluded H. sanguineus. In larger assemblages, H. sanguineus preferentially grouped under cobble, whereas C. maenas were more evenly distributed among habitat types. These observations demonstrate that conspecific tolerance and heterospecific competition can be effective, complementary mechanisms for overcoming invasion resistance. Such mechanisms help explain the well-studied success of H. sanguineus following its introduction into New England coastal habitats, and the resulting exclusion of preexisting crab species.

AB Moringa peregrina (Moringaceae), an economically important tree that occurs in arid desert mountains, is currently threatened in large part of its distribution range in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. We assessed the impact of topographic factors on population structure and performance of the species at its northwest range edge on the Hafit Mountain, UAE, where it faces harsh climatic conditions and human disturbances. Size structure, fruit production, and vitality were assessed on all 165 individual plants encountered in 12 gorges. The size distribution indicates that the population of M. peregrina is young; the proportion of small and medium-size individuals is high, but with few recorded juveniles. The frequency of plant occurrence and their performance were highest at middle altitudes. Large trees produced significantly more fruits than small and medium plants, with the larger trees of the population at middle altitude producing most fruits. M. peregrina facilitated the growth of grasses and small shrubs, but limited the presence of other big shrubs and trees beneath their canopies, compared to areas beyond. The study indicates that gorges play an important role in maintaining the M. peregrina population at its hyper-arid northwest range edge.

AB Talitrid amphipods (sandhoppers and beach fleas) are typical of the supralittoral zone. They are known to thrive on stranded materials, including detrital marine angiosperms and macroalgae, as well as occasional dead animals. In this work, the gut microbiota of five species of talitrid amphipods (Talitrus saltator, Talorchestia ugolinli, Sardorchestia pelecaniformis, Orchestia montagui and Orchestia stephenseni) collected in Sardinia (Italy) has been investigated through: i) metabarcoding analysis of the amplified 16S rRNA V4 region; and ii) quantification of family 48 glycosyl hydrolase genes (GHF48), involved in cellulose degradation. Results indicate that, though talitrid gut biodiversity is not directly related to taxon or sampling locality, the animals digestive tracts may host species-specific bacterial communities. In particular, gut microbiota of 0. montagui, an inhabitant of Posidonia banquettes and macro-algae mat, showed the greatest differences in taxonomic composition and the highest proportion of GHF48 genes with respect to 16S rRNA genes. These results suggest that the different talitrid species may host species-specific bacterial communities whose function could partially reflect the different microhabitats and food preferences of their host.

AB Rangeland management strategies must be based on robust ecological and economic concepts if they are to be effective and profitable. Thus, the aim of this paper was to examine concepts related to grazing and resting of grassland and associated effects on grassland productivity and energy flow to livestock. Our review and models demonstrate that grassland and livestock productivity is determined by lagged effects of the previous year's grazing and by grassland maturation, which influence grass growth rates, as well as forage quality. Livestock productivity is also influenced by the scale at which livestock are able to make foraging decisions in time and space, which is restricted by increasing intensity of management (increasing rotation and declining paddock size). Finally, overstocking will override key management initiatives, such as effective recovery periods, leading to rangeland degradation. Thus, in variable climates, stocking rate should be set conservatively to allow easier adaptation of animal numbers to rainfall variability from year to year. We suggest several key concepts that can be used to design and assess grazing management strategies and make suggestions on how to implement these concepts.

AB Increased attention has been paid to how the spatial dimensions of social-ecological systems are formative in shaping their ability to negotiate change and remain resilient. This paper moves this research further by exploring how diverse forms of power play a crucial role in shaping these spatial dimensions and the production of social-ecological outcomes. Grounding these explorations in a National Protected Area in Lao PDR, this paper explores how power relationships operate through the spatial and temporal domains of complex systems. Findings suggest (at least) four important insights: (1) the exercise of power materializes in policies and programs and becomes written onto the spaces of social-ecological systems through boundary creation, zonation, and other social processes that (re) define spatial meanings; these meanings vary by social actor; (2) policies and programs map out unevenly across space and time as they interact with antecedent social-ecological conditions in ways that preclude linear causal relationships between policy and outcomes; (3) although local in their expression, spatialized disputes in social-ecological systems draw on cross-scalar discourses and networks of power to bolster, undermine, and (de) legitimize competing environmental and social narratives; and (4) however powerful institutions and actor-networks may be, they are never fully hegemonic as they are attenuated by other discourses and operations of power, although these all play out across a highly uneven sociopolitical terrain. Paying greater attention to the spatial and temporal dynamics of power may be much more than a project of introducing yet another variable into the already complex admixture of analytic elements. Rather, by rendering these explicit as objects of analysis, common insights may change entirely or even be overturned.

AB Populations of large herbivores frequently display divergent migratory strategies, a likely consequence of the trade-off between the costs and benefits of migration. Globally, physical and environmental barriers disrupt migrations, leading to increased residency, which can have detrimental consequences. In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, veterinary cordon fences erected in 1982 may have caused enforced residency in some subpopulations of Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). We used data from GPS-enabled collars fitted to females in 1 resident and 1 migratory subpopulation of buffalo to test the hypotheses that 1) residents have access to less-productive forage than migrants, 2) residents occupy smaller home ranges and live in smaller herds than migrants, 3) reproductive productivity is lower in resident herds, and 4) residents have poorer body condition than migrants. Forage characteristics varied between resident and migrant ranges, both between and within seasons. Reproductive productivity and body condition did not differ between subpopulations, but residents occupied smaller home ranges during the rainy season and lived in smaller herds than migrants. Enforced residency could have decreased carrying capacity when the fence was erected, so resident buffalo may have adapted by forming smaller herds, allowing them to maintain their body condition. The area that residents occupied was located in a more central region of the Okavango Delta than that of migrants; therefore, this area would receive higher levels of nutrients from the annual flood, which would have increased heterogeneity in resident ranges, potentially compensating for effects of disrupted migrations. These results highlight the importance of conserving landscapes with spatially and temporally heterogeneous resources to buffer effects of anthropogenic activities such as artificial barriers on migrations.

AB Trace elemental fingerprinting has been used to estimate population connectivity of marine species by using variations in the chemistry of shell produced in different water masses to determine the natal location of settlers. This method has been successfully used to differentiate between estuaries and coasts at spatial scales of 10s to 100s of km. Here, we investigated the suitability of trace elemental fingerprinting to distinguish subpopulation connectivity at management scales suitable for local fishery or conservation management. The trace element chemistry of Austrovenus stutchburyi shells was used to distinguish between intra-and inter-estuary sub-populations at local (similar to 1 to 10 km) scales, with similar to 99% success. Differences between 8 locations within a large harbour and 4 smaller neighbouring estuaries were detected. Sr:Ca, Zn:Ca and Mn:Ca elemental ratios were the primary drivers of inter-site trace elemental fingerprint differences. Intra-shell variation in elemental fingerprints was used to examine temporal stability and demonstrated that, although intra-shell differences were present, site-specific differences in elemental fingerprints were maintained. The results of this study suggest trace elemental fingerprinting can be a viable method to estimate population connectivity over small inter-and intra-estuary spatial scales.

AB In this study, we identified and enumerated alginate-degrading bacteria in the gut of abalone over 1-year period. From a total of 360 colonies growing on agar medium enriched with alginate, 251 isolates (70%) had the ability to degrade alginate. In addition, a high number of viable alginate-degrading bacteria were detected throughout the survey period. Alginate-degrading bacteria were more abundant in the cold season relative to thesummer season (10(7) vs. 10(4)CFUg(-1), respectively). Strong positive correlation was also observed between the number of alginate-degrading bacteria and feed intake (R=0.854; P<0.01). The identified alginate-degrading bacteria comprised of 35 species grouped into 11 genera including Algibacter, Formosa, Polarybacter, Tamlana, Tenacibaculum (CFB group), Roseobacter, Ruegeria, Silicibacter (-proteobacteria), Agarivorans, Shewanella and Vibrio (-proteobacteria) respectively. More than 80% of the isolated alginate-degrading bacteria belonged to the genus Vibrio, showing high homology to Vibrio cyclotorophicus, Vibrio splendidus, Vibrio halioticoli and Vibrio neonatus. Based on the results, it was suggested that algal-polysaccharide (alginate) degrading bacteria (mainly Vibrio) commonly exist in the gut of abalone and may play an important role in the degradation and digestion of the host's feed.

AB Scale insects are one of the most fascinating and unusual types of organisms on Earth. Many species have been found in China, but the diversity and distribution patterns of Chinese scale insects are not well understood. To evaluate the diversity and distribution of scale insects in China, we compiled geographic distribution data from museum specimens and published literature and plotted these data using a Geographical Information System. Distribution centers of scale insects were identified by counting the number of species in each grid cell. Values were extracted from each environmental data set from each point and then the relationships between the distribution of scale insects and environment variables were explored using principal component analysis. There are 1,186 species of scale insects recorded in China belonging to 16 recognized families with an overall endemism of scale insect species of similar to 48%. However, species-description accumulation curves of scale insects suggest that a full inventory of these taxa is far from complete. None of the species accumulation curves yet drawn have reached an asymptote, indicating that current sampling procedures are still not sufficiently intensive to capture most species present within each cell. Results suggest that the number of identified species of scale insects in China is underestimated by previous inventories, and their distribution is governed by complex ecological factors. Furthermore, it was confirmed that climate is the predominant environmental determinants affecting the distribution and diversity patterns of scale insects in China.

AB Our study focuses on the keystone species Acacia tortilis and is the first to investigate the effect of domestic ungulates and aridity on seed viability and germination over an extensive part of the Eastern Sahara. Bruchids infest its seeds and reduce their viability and germination, but ingestion by ruminant herbivores diminishes infestation levels and enhances/promotes seed viability and germination. The degree of these effects seems to be correlated with animal body mass. Significantly reduced numbers of wild ruminant ungulates have increased the potential importance of domestic animals and pastoral nomadism for the functionality of arid North African and Middle Eastern ecosystems. We sampled seeds (16,543) from A. tortilis in eight areas in three regions with different aridity and land use. We tested the effect of geography and sampling context on seed infestation using random effects logistic regressions. We did a randomized and balanced germination experiment including 1193 seeds, treated with different manure. Germination time and rates across geography, sampling context, and infestation status were analyzed using time-to-event analyses, Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazards Cox regressions. Bruchid infestation is very high (80%), and the effects of context are significant. Neither partial infestation nor adding manure had a positive effect on germination. There is a strong indication that intact, uningested seeds from acacia populations in the extremely arid Western Desert germinate more slowly and have a higher fraction of hard seeds than in the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea Hills. For ingested seeds in the pastoralist areas we find that intact seeds from goat dung germinate significantly better than those from camel dung. This is contrary to the expected body-mass effect. There is no effect of site or variation in tribal management.

AB We conducted a study of black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) growth rates using data from a long-term mark-recapture study carried out in the Rupununi region of Guyana between 2005 and 2015. In contrast to previous studies, growth rates of black caiman declined with increasing size and this decline occurred more rapidly for females. Size-at-age models predicted that males and females reach asymptotic sizes of 178.2-189.0 cm SVL and 140.1-143.4 cm SVL, respectively. Our results suggest that growth rates of black caiman in the Rupununi region follow the same general patterns as for other crocodilians, and that disparities with previous black caiman studies may be largely related to density-dependent factors, among other possibilities. However, future studies that include large black caiman of known ages are needed to validate our findings.

AB 1. Antlions are opportunistic trap building predators that cannot control prey encounter. Their trap should ideally retain a great diversity of prey. However, building a single trap that captures many prey with varying characteristics can be challenging. 2. A series of five different ant species ranging from thin to large, of sizes ranging from 2.75 to 6.5mm, and a mean weight ranging from 0.54 to 6.00mg were offered in a random succession to antlions. The state of satiation of the antlions was controlled, and their mass and the depth of their pit were recorded. The reaction of antlion to the prey, the probability of capture as well as the time to escape were recorded. 3. The probability of an antlion reaction is an increasing function of the pit depth and a decreasing function of antlion mass. The probability of capture is highest for intermediate prey mass and is an increasing function of pit depth. The time to escape is a declining function of prey mass and an increasing function of pit depth. 4. There is an upper limit to prey mass given that large prey escape out of the pit. There is a lower limit to prey mass given the difficulty to apprehend the smallest, thin species. Consequently, there is a range of prey mass, corresponding to a medium-sized ant of 2mg, for which the pit functions best. The physics of insect locomotion on sandy slopes was identified as the key to understanding the functioning of antlion pits.

AB Aims
   Woody invasions into grasslands have increased globally due to changing land use, climate and introduced woody species, but spatial processes generating and sustaining these invasions are not well understood. To gain insight into the patterns of spread of tree populations within grasslands, and to propose a full spatial analytical toolbox for studying native and non-native woody species spread when long-term data are not available, we tested if 50 years of grassland invasion in Western Carpathians by Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) proceeded by one of the two traditionally competing hypotheses of species spread: (i) by frontier expansion, or (ii) by advanced groups established ahead of the population frontier. We also tested whether the pattern of invasion changed over time.
   Methods
   We analyzed the spatial demographic and genetic patterns of a Norway spruce population invading a Western Carpathian grassland using Ripley's L(t) and genetic kinship coefficients (F-ij). We mapped and genotyped spruce trees across the invasion front (from the invasion leading edge to fully colonized grassland near the source population) using three demographic classes (adults, juveniles and seedlings) to approximate the temporal aspects of the invasion. We studied how the spatial patterns of invasion by individual demographic classes and their genetic kinship varied among adjacent plots established at different distances from the source population (ranging from 0 to 160 m, in 40-m distance increments).
   Important Findings
   Juveniles were positively genetically related to adults on fine scales (<4 m), suggesting that adults within the grassland acted as a seed source and accelerated early invasion. However, adults did not act as nucleation centers for the formation of advanced juvenile groups. Instead, genetically unrelated juveniles formed groups independently of adults. These groups were small and separate at the leading edge but they increased in size and graded into a continuous zone near the source population. Thus, juvenile recruitment occurred as a frontier expansion near the source population and as advanced groups controlled by environmental variation at the leading edge. Unlike juveniles, seedlings were clustered on all scales across the invasion front and formed groups around adult crowns at the invasion leading edge. The bulk of seedling establishment occurred at intermediate distances from the source population, independently from the adults, suggesting that the invasion front continued to expand as a frontier, gradually coalescing with the advanced groups at the leading edge. Thus, the grassland invasion was driven by a gradual frontier expansion of the original population during the first 50 years, with advanced groups enhancing but not driving the invasion process. Frontier expansion appeared more important as a mechanism of woody species spread early in the invasion process in this study, while advanced groups may play a larger role over longer temporal scales.

AB A basic knowledge of regional faunas is necessary to follow the changes in macroinvertebrate communities caused by environmental influences and climatic trends in the future. We collected all the available data on water bugs in Hungary using an inventory method, a UTM grid based database was built, and Jackknife richness estimates and species accumulation curves were calculated. Fauna compositions were compared among Central-European states. As a result, an updated and annotated checklist for Hungary is provided, containing 58 species in 21 genera and 12 families. A total 66.8% of the total UTM 10 x 10 km squares in Hungary possess faunistic data for water bugs. The species number in grid cells numbered from 0 to 42, and their diversity patterns showed heterogeneity. The estimated species number of 58 is equal to the actual number of species known from the country. The asymptotic shape of the cumulative species curve predicts that additional sampling efforts will not increase the number of species currently known from Hungary. These results suggest that the number of species in the country was estimated correctly and that the species accumulation curve levels off at an asymptotic value. Thus a considerable increase in species richness is not expected in the future. Even with the species composition changing the chance of species turn-over does exist. Overall, 36.7% of the European water bug species were found in Hungary. The differences in faunal composition between Hungary and its surrounding countries were caused by the rare or unique species, whereas 33 species are common in the faunas of the eight countries. Species richness does show a correlation with latitude, and similar species compositions were observed in the countries along the same latitude. The species list and the UTM-based database are now up-to-date for Hungary, and it will provide a basis for future studies of distributional and biodiversity patterns, biogeography, relative abundance and frequency of occurrences important in community ecology, or the determination of conservation status.

AB We study the role of bush encroachment control for a farmer's income and income risk in a stochastic ecological-economic model of grazing management in semi-arid rangelands. In particular, we study debushing as an instrument of risk management that complements the choice of an adaptive grazing management strategy for that sake. We show that debushing, while being a good practice for increasing the mean pasture productivity and thus expected income, also increases the farmer's income risk. The optimal extent of debushing for a risk-averse farmer is thus determined from balancing the positive and negative consequences of debushing on intertemporal and stochastic farm income.

AB Woody encroachment in savannas is a worldwide concern, and there is growing consensus that anthropogenic activities play a central role in changing tree - grass interactions. We evaluated the influence of livestock grazing and neighborhood interactions on seedling emergence and survival of the native tree Acacia caven in wet savannas of northeastern Argentina. We hypothesized that grazing and grass competition act as biotic barriers limiting tree recruitment, but the relative magnitude of such barriers differs according to grass patch type. In two consecutive years (cohort 1 and 2) we sowed seeds and transplanted seedlings of Acacia in two grass patch types (prostrate/palatable and tussock/unpalatable grasses) in both, grazed and ungrazed plots. Each grass patch type was further manipulated to create three levels of grass competition (unclipped control, above-ground biomass removal and total biomass removal).
   Cattle grazing diminished seedling emergence of both cohorts and seedling survival of cohort 1. The effect of grass competition changed according to grass patch type. Prostrate grass cover enhanced emergence but lowered early survival, while tussock grass cover and also its total biomass removal facilitated early survival. During the second year, a severe drought drastically reduced Acacia recruitment, and it was strong enough to eliminate any grazing effects although the effect of grass competition on seedling establishment remained significant.
   Our results suggest that grazing and grass competition additively diminished the risk of woody establishment in this wet savanna. However, the stocking rate should be carefully balanced, thus contributing to the maintenance of a competitive grass cover to limit tree recruitment. (C) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

DE Actual risk; GIS; Indicator; Potential risk; Vegetation degradation
AB The entire land in the Southern Iran faces problems arising out of various types of land degradation, of which the vegetation type forms one of the major ones. The Payab basin (522,470 ha), which covers the lower reaches of Mond River, was chosen for a test risk assessment of this type. The different kinds of data for indicators of vegetation degradation were taken from the records and published reports of Iran governmental offices. A new model was developed for assessing the risk of vegetation degradation. Taking into consideration nine indicators of vegetation degradation, the model identifies areas with 'Potential Risk' (risky zones) and areas of 'Actual Risk' projecting the probability of the worse degradation in future. The preparation of risk maps, based on the GIS analysis of these indicators will be helpful for prioritizing the areas to initiate remedial measures. A hazard map for each indicator was first prepared in GIS by fixing the thresholds of severity classes of the indicators. The risk classes were defined on the basis of risk scores arrived at by assigning the appropriate attributes to the indicators and the risk map prepared by overlaying some nine hazard maps in the GIS. Areas under actual risk were found to be widespread (93%) in the basin and when the risk map classified into subclasses of potential risk with different probability levels the model would project a statistical picture of the risk of vegetation degradation.

Escherichia, Desemzia, Staphylococcus, Asticcacaulis, Cellvibrio, Aurantimonas, and Planomicrobium were isolated from the gut of the adults, with Escherichia and Staphylococcus being the main bacterial communities, and the quantities of intestinal bacterial were different in the adults fed different diets. Specifically, the amount of intestinal bacteria from the adults fed different diets had the following ranking according to the major component of the diet: ant powder > darkling beetle pupa powder > cricket powder > silkworm pupa powder. Escherichia, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Kurthia, Planococcaceae, Ralstonia, Leptothrix, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas were isolated from the gut of the larvae. The quantity of intestinal bacteria from the larvae fed the darkling beetle pupae was greater than that from the larvae fed other artificial diets. This study, for the first time, investigated the effect of artificial diets on the bacterial community and the intestinal microbial diversity of D. helophoroides.

AB The biosecurity risks from many plantparasitic nematode (PPN) species are poorly known and remain a major challenge for identifying potentially invasive species. A self organising map (SOM) was used to prioritise biosecurity risks from PPN to the whole of continental Australia as well as each of the states and the Northern Territory separately. The SOM used the recorded worldwide distributions of 250 systematically selected species from 43 genera, and identified 18 different countries spanning Asia, Africa, North and Central America, Europe and the Pacific with very similar PPN assemblages to Australia as a whole. Many of the species in these countries are not recorded in Australia, and therefore pose a biosecurity risk. Analysed separately, the states and territories were identified as forming five separate clusters, each with a different region of the world, and with different characteristic PPN. Many of the PPN found in the regions clustered with an Australian state have not been recorded from anywhere in Australia, and others have very restricted distributions within Australia, thus posing different biosecurity risks. The SOM analysis ranked the risks of the different PPN based on likelihoods of establishment. The rankings confirmed the risks from frequently quarantined PPN, but more importantly identified species, which upon further investigation could be new threats. This method can be used to identify previously overlooked species for more detailed risk assessments.

AB In many African countries, large carnivores such as lions (Panthera leo (L., 1758)) are under serious threat through conflict with people, declining prey abundance, and exposure to disease. Spoor and prey count surveys were used to determine temporal and spatial variation in lion density in Khutse Game Reserve (KGR), Botswana, and the adjacent communal grazing area. Estimated lion density in KGR for the period September 2008 - June 2010 was 41% lower than for the period June 2007 August 2008 (1.02 vs. 1.72 lions/100 km(2)). Prior to this population crash in mid-2008, estimated lion density in the communal grazing area (1.21 lions/100 km(2)) was 30% lower than inside KGR. The relative abundance of the three most abundant, preferred prey species of lions occurring in KGR decreased from 2001 to 2008 by 50%-79%. Based on two prey biomass estimates, the lion population in KGR was below the potential carrying capacity of the habitat after the crash in mid-2008. These results suggest that there could be a human-caused population sink around KGR, which might be strong enough to threaten the long-term survival of lions in the area; particularly if this edge effect is intensified by prey depletion and disease outbreaks, which might have caused the sudden decline in the lion population.

AB Management approaches taken in protected areas will affect their ability and effectiveness to conserve biodiversity. MalaMala (a concession within Sabi Sand Wildtuin, a private game reserve), and an adjacent area in the Kruger National Park (Kruger, statutory protected area) in South Africa provide a comparison of different types of conservation management. We measured three-dimensional woody vegetation structure, as an integral component of biodiversity, across 6200 ha in the two reserves using a LiDAR (Light-Detection-and-Ranging) sensor. We compared how different management approaches in the two reserves affected woody structural diversity. Vertical canopy diversity was measured using: i) percent cover of woody vegetation extracted from LiDAR canopy height models, ii) a volumetric pixel (voxel) approach to extract 3D vertical canopy-height profiles; and iii) horizontal diversity using landscape metrics. MalaMala had higher vegetation density than Kruger in the <3 m (2.5 times) and >6 m (2.7 times) height classes. This vegetation was in the form of larger, more cohesive patches as a result of the legacy of previous land-use (cattle ranching) and current management practices (bush clearing) and the recent increase in megaherbivores. Length of exposure to, and recent higher densities of, megaherbivores (particularly elephants) has altered the density of tall trees in the two reserves, thus affecting structural heterogeneity and associated habitat options for small-bodied vertebrates. These differences in vegetation structure are exacerbated by current management practices (e.g. bush-clearing and fire regime), with potential implications for faunal biodiversity conservation across a wide range of scales.

AB Predators use different foraging modes, ranging from active to ambush predation. We investigated the predatory behaviour of two antlion species, the pit-builder Euroleon nostras and the non-pit-builder Neuroleon microstenus, both considered as ambush predators but with different predatory strategies. Since the pit-builders evolved from non-pit-builders, we focused on the similarities and differences in behavioural patterns and capture success. We found that most behavioural patterns occur in both species, although the non-pit-builder's behaviour is less stereotypic and exhibits more behavioural patterns than in the pit-builder when comparing behaviour from prey introduction to jaw set without pit-construction. In N. microstenus, two distinct behavioural sequences were noted, which depend on the method of prey carcass clearing. This is the first report describing two methods of prey-carcass clearing in a non-pit-builder: tossing or dropping the prey. We also noted the presence of camouflage in the non-pit-builder, considered as an important mechanism in anti-predator tactics.

AB Plant-community structure and groundwater attributes were investigated in Ejina Delta in north-western China to understand spatial variability of groundwater depth and composition and their impacts on vegetation succession. Geostatistical methods and ordination analysis were performed to analyse the data. In addition, we tried to obtain vegetation successional series by using an approach of spatial sequences instead of temporal sequences. The findings of the present study were as follows: (1) the coefficient of variation for groundwater depth (GWD), salinity (SAL), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-, Cl- and F- ranged from 0.04 to 1.53; (2) GWD, Mg2+, TDS, EC, Ca2+, HCO3-, NO3- and pH showed strong spatial autocorrelation, whereas K+ and SAL showed moderate spatial autocorrelation; (3) canonical correspondence analysis revealed that groundwater heterogeneity, especially GWD, followed by pH, SAL, TDS, EC and HCO3-, had an important impact on vegetation succession, and thus showed a prevalence of groundwater attributes-based niche differentiation among plant communities; and (4) there were two vegetation successional processes (drought and salinisation) in the lower Heihe River Basin, and salinisation processes increased with drought processes. Our results indicated that high spatial variability of groundwater attributes contributes to promoting maintenance of species and landscape diversity in the lower Heihe River Basin.

AB Mismatches in nutrient composition (e.g., protein, carbohydrates, lipids, etc.) between consumers and the resources they depend on can have ecological consequences, affecting traits from individual behavior to community structure. In many terrestrial ecosystems, ants depend on plant and insect mutualist partners for carbohydrate-rich rewards that are nutritionally unbalanced (especially in protein) relative to colony needs. Despite imbalances, many carbohydrate-feeding ant mutualists dominate communitiesboth competitively and numericallyraising the question of whether excess carbohydrates fuel' colony acquisition of limiting resources and growth. In a 10-month field study, we manipulated carbohydrate access for the obligate plant-ant Crematogaster nigriceps to test whether carbohydrate availability could be mechanistically linked to ecological dominance via heightened territory defense, increased protein foraging, and colony growth. Supplementation increased aggressive defense of hosts after only twoweeks, but was also strongly linked to variation in rainfall. Contrary to predictions, we did not find that supplemented colonies increased protein foraging. Instead, colonies with reduced carbohydrate access discovered a greater proportion of protein baits, suggesting that carbohydrate deprivation increases foraging intensity. We found no significant effect of carbohydrate manipulation on brood or alate production. These results contrast with findings from several recent short-term and lab-based nutrient supplementation studies and highlight the role of seasonality and biotic context in colony-foraging and reproductive decisions. These factors may be essential to understanding the consequences of carbohydrate access in natural plant-ant systems.

AB A common measure of ecosystem resilience is the time course to recovery for a system that has been previously disturbed. The goal of this study was to assess whether forest lepidopteran communities displayed three different forms of resilience following experimental timber harvest. Specifically, I examined whether moth species assemblages returned to pre-logging composition (compositional resilience), species richness (structural resilience), and guild diversity (functional resilience) after forest management. Lepidoptera were sampled from 16 forest stands managed with one of four harvest treatments: no logging, clear-cutting, shelterwood harvests, and group selection harvests. Moths were sampled from all forest stands one year prior to harvest in 2007 and immediately postharvest in 2009-2011. Moth community composition only appeared to be resilient to timber harvest in stands managed with shelterwood methods (15% biomass removed) or in the unlogged stands within managed concession units. Both total species richness and species richness of Quercus-feeding moths also appeared to recover to a near original condition three years post-shelterwood logging. In contrast, moth assemblages in clear-cut stands and group selection stands (80% biomass removed) remained impoverished. Tests of functional resilience suggested that richness of species known to be pollinators was largely unaffected by timber management, and the number of moth species known to feed on herbaceous vegetation doubled in stands logged using group selection methods. Dietary specialists were disproportionately abundant in the unlogged stands postharvest, suggesting that species with more narrow dietary niches have the lowest resilience to timber management. These results suggest that most methods of forest management have short-term negative impacts on woody-plant-feeding Lepidoptera, but that the effects are limited to a few years when the harvest method involves shelterwood cuts. Herbaceous-feeding Lepidoptera appear to quickly colonize stands managed with group selection or clear-cutting, so loss of species richness in stands managed with either of these treatments may be less than predicted based on level of timber being removed. Recovery of moth assemblages in more highly disturbed stands will require longer time periods and techniques such as group selection harvests, where upwards of 80% of the standing bole is removed, may not be consistent with conservation goals.

AB Assignment of large numbers of vegetation plots to a priori vegetation classifications is increasingly being required to support natural resource management, monitoring and conservation at regional scales. Several automated systems have been developed that use quantitative synoptic tables and algorithm-based plot-to-type assignment. However, where synoptic tables do not exist, and qualitative species lists characterise vegetation type classifications, existing systems may not apply. In these situations, vegetation experts may resort to manual assignment processes that can be slow, subjective and fraught with difficulties. This study combines repeatable and objective quantitative analyses, with new software, to deliver a semi-automated plot-to-type assignment process appropriate for a priori classifications based on qualitative species lists. The flexible semi-automated assignment program (SAAP) calculates a quantitative goodness-of-fit score between plots and types, based on the species that characterise each a priori vegetation type, and the species that characterise groups of plots derived from quantitative analyses. We applied the SAAP to a case-study of 630 native vascular plant species from 930 plots, and an a priori classification of 99 vegetation types. We varied vegetation data set transforms [cover per cent (0100%), cover score (06) and presenceabsence (1, 0)] and analysis settings and tested the degree to which the SAAP provided plot-to-type assignment concordant with manual expert assignment. Results provided clear evidence supporting the choice of particular data set transformations and analysis settings to maximise concordance. The SAAP allocated up to 50% of plots to the same expert-assigned vegetation type, and more than 70% of plots to an expert-assigned vegetation type ranked in the top five by the SAAP. When coupled with repeatable and objective quantitative analyses, the SAAP provides vegetation experts with a new semi-automated and quantitative decision support tool to assist with the assignment of vegetation plots within a priori vegetation classifications defined by characteristic species lists.

AB Adults of three fairy shrimp species are present in Thailand from February through June in ephemeral waters (ponds, roadside canals, and rice field ditches) filled mostly by the rain. Branchinella thailandensis is of interest in aquaculture because it reproduces rapidly and has high nutritional value. However, no detailed studies on its reproductive biology are available. Anatomical analyses of male and female genitalia were studied with light microscopy and SEM. Shrimp were reared in the laboratory at 28 +/- 1 degrees C in aerated, potable water using the alga Chlorella sp. as food. One female ancl two males were placed in each of ten I-L. observation containers and the female reproductive stages were monitored every hour over six days. Branchinella thailandensis exhibits zygogenetic reproduction and oviparity, where fertilization is direct and internal; the brood pouch shows an undifferentiated amplexial groove. Males and females reach maturity on days 7 and 8 after hatching, with a mean standard length of 10.3 and 12.2 mm, respectively. Males have unique spines on the gonopods, with a tip on a socket-like base; accessory glands were not evident in histological sections. Females have biramous ovaries; the shell glands are organized in two paired, bilateral clusters, in which the glandular unit is formed by two gland-cells and a single duct. After six complete reproductive cycles, the mean total duration of the reproductive cycle was similar to 24.0 h (N = 60). The total duration of the reproductive cycle and egg production increased with age (subsequent reproductive cycles). No oosorption in unmated females was observed, and the oocytes passed to the ovisac independent of copulation. Our results confirmed that Stage 3 is the longest reproductive stage in anostracan females. Branchinella thailandensis produces typical freshwater anostracan sculptured eggs, and belongs to the fairy shrimp group without a sub-cortical space beneath the egg shell.

AB Antlion larvae are typically considered as trap-building predators, but some species of antlions always forage without using pits or only sometimes use pits to capture prey; they can ambush prey without pits. This study examined a species that switches its strategy between pit-trapping and ambushing and asked the mechanism behind the switching behaviour. A dynamic optimization model incorporating tradeoffs between the two strategies was built. The tradeoffs were prey capture success and predation risk (both are higher when pit-trapping). The model predicted that antlions should use the trap-building strategy when their energy status is low and should use the ambush strategy when their energy status is high. These predictions as well as an assumption (i.e., predation risk associated with pit-trapping is higher than that associated with ambushing) of the model were empirically confirmed. The results suggest that antlions flexibly switch between pit-trapping and ambushing to maximize their fitness by balancing the costs and benefits of the two strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) is commonly grown throughout the world as a major plantation species. Non-native radiata pine plantations are often established as monocultures amongst large tracts of remnant native vegetation. While the direct impacts on native biodiversity of such vegetation replacement have been well documented, much less is known about how plant litterfall from such plantations influences ecosystem dynamics beyond the confines of the plantation limits. In this study, we assessed the inputs of plant litterfall from radiata pine plantations into surrounding native woodland vegetation over a two-year period in south-eastern Australia. We found that pine litter was a significant and even dominant component of litterfall at certain times of the year, typically autumn and winter, when quantities of pine needles falling were up to three times the fall of native leaves. Pine litter was found to be lower in quality than native litter, containing less carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and having a higher C:N ratio than native litter. Although the comparatively larger inputs of pine litter resulted in C and N inputs that were 2-3 times those of native litter during some seasons, the influx of low-quality pine litter is likely to decompose slowly and immobilise N, thereby limiting the availability of N for plant growth in the long term. The intrusion of large quantities of pine litter into native eucalypt woodland may have a suite of further short and long term impacts on native biodiversity through a number of mechanisms including alteration of leaf-litter invertebrate communities, increased fire intensity and changes in microclimate. These impacts may be alleviated by preventing pine litter entering woodland communities through the use of modified buffer zones and by employing appropriate plantation design. We discuss the merits and shortfalls of various options available to land mangers to minimise pine-litter intrusion into adjacent native woodlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For several decades, agroforestry specialists have promoted the planting of fallow fields with nitrogen-fixing, fast-growing trees or shrubs to accelerate soil rehabilitation and provide secondary products like woodfuel. Yet, such 'improved fallows' have not been widely adopted, in part due to the costs of labour and seedlings. In some situations, however, farmers have developed novel approaches to agroforestry fallows by taking advantage of spontaneous invasions of woody leguminous tree species present in the vicinity of their fields. In this paper, we examine cases from R,union, highland Madagascar, the Bateke plateau in Congo, and the Palni hills of southern India where farmers have adapted their cultivation practices to take advantage of the invasive characteristics of Australian acacias that were introduced earlier for other reasons. We focus on the key social, economic, and environmental factors that influence farmers in these places to gain opportunistic benefit from these introduced tree species that biologists have been deemed invasive and damaging to local ecosystems and biodiversity. We conclude that opportunistic fallowing of invasives can be viewed as a hybrid strategy combining elements of natural fallows and improved fallows-which we call 'hybrid improved fallows'aEuro"in that it takes advantage of the 'weedy' characteristics of introduced leguminous tree species in the landscape and offers a cost-effective and pragmatic strategy for soil and vegetation management for farmers.

AB Located approximately 360 nm off the coast of Chile there is a disjoint realm of two small oceanic islands systems, the Juan Fernandez and the Desventuradas archipelago. Currently the local economy of the islands is almost exclusively supported by the harvest and trade of marine resources, focusing mainly on the exploitation of the rock lobster (Jasus frontalis). This endemic species is distributed in both archipelagos, forming a metapopulation, whose population structure and dynamic is modulated by oceanographic forcing, especially during its extended planktonic larval phase. The population structure and the conection-retention within and between islands was assessed, based on the use of coupled biophysical model (the hidrodynamics model OFES and an individual-based model of J. frontalis). The analysis of the hydrodynamic model predictions showed the presence of mesoscale structures associated with the islands systems. The simulation results indicated significant levels of connectivity-retention within and between island systems showing also a strong interannual variation of these. Biophysical modeling results indicated that recruitment varibility associated with the Juan Fernandez archipelago depends mainly on larvae originated within this system, which as well will contribute with recruits to the Desventuradas archipelago. The sensitivity analysis of the biophysical model to identify the potential biophysical forcing of the dependent variables of the model (e.g. connectivity-retention index), resulted in that temporal and spatial patterns reproductive larval stage duration and season (year) are highly significant factors. Finally, a metapopulation structure for J. frontalis, with a high level of connectivity in the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and a considerable amount of larvae in the Desventuradas islands is proposed. These fluxes are determined mainly by the coupling between prevailing biological and oceanographic factors.

AB The absence of natural enemies being keystone to the success of invasive alien plants (IAPs) can only be accepted once all the factors governing the invader and the ecosystems it invades have been established. Few studies have attempted this approach. This study reports on the relations between the invasive alien forb Campuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.) DC. (pompom weed), herbivory and the ecology of the rangelands invaded in South Africa. Eighty invaded rangelands in Gauteng Province were studied. Pompom weed herbivory was insignificant with the greatest damage being caused by native grasshoppers. Rainfall, topography and soil texture were the primary drivers of vegetation pattern. Pompom weed exhibited disturbance-mediated invasion strategies, favouring rangelands affected by non-sustainable commercial grazing practices, abandoned agricultural fields and drained wetlands. It invaded vegetation in poor condition with sward basal cover < 19%. Weed density was exacerbated by high fire frequency. Vegetation susceptible to pompom weed was also invaded by other alien and native pasture weeds. The absence of natural enemies could give pompom weed a competitive advantage over native pioneer cohorts in disturbed rangelands, but is unlikely to increase fitness enabling its establishment in vegetation in good condition. Grazing strategies that promote the dominance of grass species adapted to frequent non-selective defoliation appear to restrict pompom weed better than degraded rangelands that are not utilised. Biotic resistance of rangelands to pompom weed invasion will be greatest in vegetation in good condition and under good management. The low abundance of pompom weed in rangelands in communal areas and fence-line contrasts in invaded and un-invaded road reserves warrants further investigation.

AB Grazing and fire have been the most common disturbances in many grasslands ecosystems for many centuries. However, some mountain regions are currently experiencing a decrease in land use, and therefore in frequency or intensity of these disturbances. In this study, we evaluated how fire and grazing affect vegetation structure in mountain grasslands of NW Argentina. We hypothesized that they would have differential effects on plant species richness, vegetation composition and aerial biomass dynamics, predicting that fire would have a stronger effect on these variables than grazing. We tested this hypothesis by performing a controlled field experiment in which we manipulated fire and compared grazed plots with ungrazed exclosures, simulating current (high frequent fires and low livestock load) and future (fire suppression and grazing exclosure) scenarios. We recorded total of 90 species with 40 shared among all treatments. Tussock grasses (Elionurus muticus), followed by three shrubs represented the main contribution to live biomass in all treatments. Species richness, equitativity and diversity were higher in burned plots. Multivariate ordination indicated that burning is more important than grazing in determining plot to plot similarity in species composition. Burning reduced total aerial biomass, standing dead biomass and litter, as well as live biomass, that was also reduced by grazing. Burning also reduced standing dead biomass and litter proportions, but increased live biomass contribution, showing a more evident effect within the grazed plots. Burning, seasonality and growing season had significant effects on the relative contribution of all biomass categories. Biomass consumption showed a strong seasonality, being significantly higher in January of both growing seasons, and it was not affected by burning. We conclude that under the current fire and grazing scenario, fire plays a more important role than grazing in shaping these grasslands dynamics. (C)2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Despite its appeal to explain plant invasions, the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) remains largely unexplored for tropical forest trees. Even scarcer are ERH studies conducted on the same host species at both the community and biogeographical scale, irrespective of the system or plant life form. In Cabrits National Park, Dominica, we observed patterns consistent with enemy release of two introduced, congeneric mahogany species, Swietenia macrophylla and S. mahagoni, planted almost 50 years ago. Swietenia populations at Cabrits have reproduced, with S. macrophylla juveniles established in and out of plantation areas at densities much higher than observed in its native range. Swietenia macrophylla juveniles also experienced significantly lower leaf-level herbivory (similar to 3.0%) than nine co-occurring species native to Dominica (8.4-21.8%), and far lower than conspecific herbivory observed in its native range (11%-43%, on average). These complimentary findings at multiple scales support ERH, and confirm that Swietenia has naturalized at Cabrits. However, Swietenia abundance was positively correlated with native plant diversity at the seedling stage, and only marginally negatively correlated with native plant abundance for stems >= 1-cm dbh. Taken together, these descriptive patterns point to relaxed enemy pressure from specialized enemies, specifically the defoliator Steniscadia poliophaea and the shoot-borer Hypsipyla grandella, as a leading explanation for the enhanced recruitment of Swietenia trees documented at Cabrits.

AB The endangered patellid limpet Cymbula nigra is present in the extreme western Mediterranean, yet the species has rarely been the subject of study in this region. The aim of the present research is to describe the ecology, distribution and population structure of the species in an area of the Mediterranean coast of North Africa (Ceuta). Results indicate that the species prevails in waters that have an important Atlantic influence. Furthermore, different shell morphologies are distinguished, and in consequence, a statistical analysis is carried out based on morphometric data. Based on maximum shell length, height/length coefficients and shell morphology, a total of three significantly different morphologies are described. Furthermore, considering physical parameters such as height over seawater level and average substratum inclination, juveniles resulted to be clearly segregated from the two other groups. Additionally, no differences were found regarding the topography of the substrate used by juvenile and adult individuals, although the colonized surfaces are significantly smoother than those where Patella ferruginea is present.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) stocks in an agroforestry system with water harvesting were analysed in a field experiment and the results compared with those of other crop management systems in the Mediterranean zone of central Chile. Agroforestry with water harvesting showed higher positive effects on N stocks, mainly in the upper soil layer, than the other crop management systems. However, soil analysis revealed a lack of differences between treatments, a fact that might be related mainly to the short study time (12 years) and the high spatial variability in these soil properties at the experimental site. In addition, the Introductory Carbon Balance Model that simulates N processes (ICBM/N) was evaluated for simulating trends in SOC and N stocks in the field experiment. Soil data collected between 1996 and 2008 in the field experiment and primarily literature data sets were used to test ICBM/N and its performance was evaluated by considering uncertainty in model inputs using Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. The GLUE estimates (5% and 95%) and measured SOC and N stocks were in satisfactory agreement. The observed SOC and N stocks were bracketed by the uncertainty bands in 70% and 80% of the simulations, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed the model to be most sensitive to C parameters, such as the humification coefficient (h). The results of this study show that ICBM/N can be an effective tool for estimating SOC and N stocks from agroforestry combined with water harvesting systems in the Mediterranean zone of central Chile over the medium term. However, they also indicate that additional data sets are needed to redefine the parameter distributions in the model and thus to predict trends in SOC and N stocks in the future.

AB An important aspect of managing African conservation areas involves understanding how large herbivores affect woody plant growth. Yet, data on growth rates of woody species in savannas are scarce, despite its critical importance for developing models to guide ecosystem management. What effect do browsing and season have on woody stem growth? Assuming no growth happens in the dry season, browsing should reduce stem growth in the wet season only. Secondly, do functional species groups differ in stem growth? For example, assuming fine-leaved, spiny species' growth is not compromised by carbon-based chemical defences, they should grow faster than broad-leaved, chemically defended species. Dendrometers were fixed at 20 cm in height on the main stems of 244 random plants of six woody species in three plots (all large herbivores excluded, partial exclusion, and control) and observed from late 2006 to early 2010. Average monthly increment (AMI) per dendrometer and season (dry, wet) was calculated and the interaction between plot and season tested per species, controlling for initial stem girth. AMIs of Combretum apiculatum, Dichrostachys cinerea and Grewia flavescens were zero in the dry season, whilst those of Acacia exuvialis, Acacia grandicornuta and Euclea divinorum were either positive or negative in the dry season. Wet-season AMI of D. cinerea and dry-season AMI of G. flavescens tended to be reduced by browser exclusion. Net AMI (sum of the seasonal AMIs) was tested per species, but results suggested that only D. cinerea tended to be affected by browser exclusion. The results also suggested that stem radial growth of some fast-growing species is more prone to reduction by browser exclusion than the growth of other species, potentially reducing their competitiveness and increasing their risk of extirpation. Finally, the usefulness of grouping woody species into simple functional groups (e. g. fine-leaved vs. broad-leaved) for ecosystem management purposes in savannas requires further consideration.
   Conservation implications: Growth rates of woody plants are important parameters in savanna models, but data are scarce. Monitoring dendrometers in manipulative situations over several years can help fill that gap. Results of such studies can be used to identify species prone to high risk of extirpation.

AB The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of light and temperature on seed germination and the effect of light on seedling emergence of Clausena excavata, an invasive exotic species. Seeds were incubated at constant temperatures (10 to 40 degrees C), under continuous white light and darkness. Seedling emergence was evaluated under full sun and canopy shade. There was no significant difference between seeds germinated in the presence or absence of light at temperatures between 20 and 35 degrees C. Seeds maintained at 20 degrees C germinated more slowly than other temperatures. Independent of temperature, seed germination was much more synchronised under white light than under darkness. In the field, emergence occurred in both environments, but a greater percentage was observed under full sun. Seedling emergence occurred at the same rate and synchronisation index under both conditions. C. excavata has a high invader potential in open areas and shaded environments.

AB Ecological restoration of the Wangaloa coal mine in southern New Zealand is hindered by a range of geoecological factors. The site has some substrate acidification (down to pH 1) and acid rock drainage with discharge waters initially down to pH 4, although this has since risen to ca. pH 6. Surface and ground waters develop elevated sulfate (up to 700 mg/kg) during oxidation of pyrite in coal and quartz in waste rock. Coal has elevated boron content (up to 450 mg/kg) and surface waters on coal-rich waste rock have up to 6 mg/L dissolved boron. Evaporation causes formation of salt encrustations dominated by gypsum with minor boron salts. Boron is bio-available and may be at toxic levels (>200 mg/kg) in some plants. Quartz-rich waste rock is readily eroded, and develops a cm-scale low-nutrient quartz pebble armouring layer with low water retention properties. All waste rocks including loess siltstone have low nutrient contents, and low moisture retention properties, that are barely sufficient for plant establishment. Native plants introduced to the site during rehabilitation have grown on loess substrate (up to fivefold increase in height over 3 years), with poor or no growth on coal-rich and quartz-rich substrates. In contrast, natural colonisation of manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) has been most effective at revegetation on even the most hostile substrates. This natural revegetation has been facilitated by islands of manuka established accidentally during 60 years of mining history. Manuka from local genetic stock is most viable for this revegetation, and introduced manuka seedlings have had a 70% mortality rate. Natural plant colonisation is the key step in overall ecosystem recovery, and invertebrates rapidly colonise beneath new shrubs irrespective of the nature of the substrate from vegetation islands that have high invertebrate numbers and species richness.

AB Autumn-olive (Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb) is an invasive exotic shrub that has become naturalized in the eastern United States and can fix nitrogen (N) via a symbiotic relationship with the actinomycete Frankia Fixed N could potentially influence nutrient cycling rates and N leaching into soil water and groundwater In situ net N mineralization, net nitrification, and net ammonification rates, as well as soil water and groundwater nitrate N (NO3-N) and ammonium N (NH4-N) concentrations, were measured under autumn-olive dominated and herbaceous open field areas in southern Illinois Sod net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were higher under autumn-olive compared with open field (p < 0 05) and could be driven, in parr, by the relatively low C/N ratio (11 41 +/- 0 29) of autumn-olive foliage and subsequent litter Autumn-olive stands also had greater sod water NO3-N (p = 0 003), but soil water NH4-N concentrations were similar between autumn-olive and open field. Groundwater NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations were similar beneath both types of vegetation Groundwater NO4-N concentrations did not reflect patterns in soil N mineralization and soil water NO3-N most likely clue to a weak hydrologic connection between sod water and groundwater The increased N levels in sod and soil water indicate that abandoned agroecosystems invaded by autumn-olive may be net sources of N to adjacent terrestrial and aquatic systems rather than net sinks

AB The coexistence of trees and grasses in savanna ecosystems is a contentious phenomenon. Fire and herbivory disturbances are often cited as major structuring forces that create a sustainable tree grass relationship. However, periodic flooding of savanna patches may also enable coexistence. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of flood-disturbance on the recruitment patterns of Acacia karroo trees in a semi-arid savanna system in South Africa. We analysed the spatial coincidence of A. karroo seedlings with tussocks of the tall spiny grass Stipagrostis namaquensis in the riverbed and related herbivory intensity to spatial position. The data showed that A. karroo seedlings were significantly positively associated with S. namaquensis (Chi-square test, chi(2)(1) = 45.20, n = 118, P < 0.001); A. karroo seedlings growing inside of tussocks experienced less browsing pressure than those growing in the floodplain (Kruskal-Wallis test, H = 11.90, n = 118, P < 0.01); and recruitment success of A. karroo trees was spatially discrete (K-S test, D = 0.78, n = 196, P < 0.01). We suggest that floods create an enemy-free zone, which S. namaquensis colonises and then facilitates successful A. karroo establishment. High levels of A. karroo recruitment in the riverbed may replenish the woodlands fringing the river, which appear to be sink areas for A. karroo seedlings. Thus, the interaction between disturbances at different spatial and temporal scales (flooding versus herbivory) seems to maintain the inherently unstable coexistence of tree and grass species in this ecosystem. These findings also suggested that flood disturbances alter the tree-grass relationship.

AB Ecosystems with high seabird densities can receive extremely high inputs of nitrogen (N) from bird guano. Seabirds deposit up to 1000 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) on Heron Island, a tropical coral cay of the Great Barrier Reef. We quantified atmospheric concentrations of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with passive air samplers at beach, woodland and forest along a gradient of low, intermediate and high bird densities, respectively. NO2 concentrations at all studied sites were generally low (average 0.2-2.3 mu g NO2 m(-3)) and similar to other ecosystems. An exception was the main traffic zone of helicopter and barge traffic which had elevated concentrations (average 6.2, maximum 25 mu g NO2 m(-3)) comparable to traffic-intense urban areas elsewhere. Increasing average NH3 concentrations from 0.7 to 17 mu g NH3 m(-3) was associated with greater seabird nesting density. In areas of intermediate and high bird density, NH3 concentrations were substantially higher than those typically detected in natural and agricultural systems, supporting the notion that seabird guano is a major source of NH3. The steep decline of NH3 concentrations in areas with low bird density indicates that trans-island transport of NH3 is low. NH3 may not only be re-deposited in close vicinity of the source but is also transported vertically as concentrations above the tree canopy averaged 7.5 mu g NH3 m(-3). How much guano-derived NH3 contributes to reefal waters via the possible transfer path water -> land -> water remains to be established. We discuss atmospheric concentrations of NH3 and NO2 in context of N-based gaseous pollutants and effects on vegetation.

ID EQUATION
AB Most of the population growth models comprise the concept of carrying capacity presume that a stable population would have a saturation level characteristic. This indicates that the population growth models have a common implicit feature of resource-limited growth, which contributes at a later stage of population growth by forming a numerical upper bound on the population size. However, a general underlying resource dynamics of the models has not been previously explored, which is the focus of present study. In this paper, we found that there exists a conservation of energy relationship comprising the terms of available resource and population density, jointly interpreted here as total available vital energy in a confined environment. We showed that this relationship determines a density-dependent functional form of relative population growth rate and consequently the parametric equations are in the form depending upon the population density, resource concentration, and time. Thus, the derived form of relative population growth rate is essentially a feedback type, i.e., updating parametric values for the corresponding population density. This resource dynamics-based feedback approach has been implemented for formulating variable carrying capacity in a confined environment. Particularly, at a constant resource replenishment rate, a density-dependent population growth equation similar to the classic logistic equation is derived, while one of the regulating factors of the underlying resource dynamics is that the resource consumption rate is directly proportional to the resource concentration. Likewise two other population growth equations similar to two known popular growth equations are derived based on this resource dynamics-based feedback approach. Using microcosm-derived data of fungus T. virens, we fitted one derived population growth model against the datasets, and concluded that this approach is practically implementable for studying a single population growth regulation in a confined environment.

AB Passive dispersal has traditionally formed a fundamental component of biogeographical theories of the origin of the fauna that occupy the ice-free habitats of mainland Antarctica. But in the context of an emerging picture of endemism for many Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates, is there still a place for such stochastic processes in Antarctic biogeography? The case of the Antarctic fairy shrimp, Branchinecta gaini Daday 1910, may provide an answer - or, at least, an important exception to the rule. Although passive dispersal is certainly a stochastic and contingent phenomenon in Antarctica, the occurrence of B. gaini on the Antarctic Peninsula can only be explained satisfactorily by resort to this explanation. It is, at present, probably the best example of an Antarctic invertebrate with a biogeographic signature of passive - in particular, zoophoretic - dispersal.

AB In the 2006/2007 breeding season of Cape gannets Morus capensis at Malgas Island, the removal of 61 Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus that preyed on gannet fledglings when they left to sea significantly reduced the mortality rate of these fledglings. However, because seals learned to avoid the boat used for their removal, it was not possible to remove all the seals that killed gannet fledglings and some mortality continued. The seals inflicting the mortality were all sub-adult males, with an average age of < 5 years. Sustained removal of these animals may reduce this feeding behaviour, which is at present having an adverse impact on several threatened seabirds in the Benguela ecosystem.

AB Natural forests are often replaced by invasive alien trees on isolated oceanic islands. Adequate eradication of invasive trees should be conducted with the goal of biodiversity conservation, because islands support many endemic organisms that depend on native forests. An invasive alien tree, Bischofia javanica Blume (Euphorbiaceae), has invaded and replaced natural forests on the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. To determine how the removal of B. javanica trees affects insect diversity, we examined flying beetles captured using Malaise traps in B. javanica forests on Hahajima. The abundance, species density, and species composition of wood-boring beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae, Elateridae, Mordellidae, and Scolytidae) were compared between closed-canopy sites and gaps created by girdling B. javanica trees in alien forests during two seasons (June-July and October-November 2005). Of the collected beetles, 75.8, 87.5, 90.0, and 0.0% of cerambycid, elaterid, mordellid, and scolytid beetle species, respectively, were endemic to the Ogasawara Islands. More cerambycid, elaterid, and mordellid individuals were captured in June-July than in October-November; the number of scolytid individuals did not differ between seasons. More cerambycid, elaterid, and scolytid individuals were captured in artificial gaps than on the closed-canopy forest floor. Although fewer mordellid individuals were captured in gaps, more endemic mordellids were captured in gaps. More cerambycid and scolytid species were captured in artificial gaps than in closed-canopy areas. The positive responses of beetles to artificial gaps suggest that the removal of B. javanica increases beetle diversity and the abundance of endemic beetles.

AB Soil chemistry can play an important role in determining plant diversity. Serpentine soils are usually toxic to many plant taxa, which limits plant diversity compared to that on adjacent non-serpentine soils. The usually high concentrations of toxic metals in serpentine soils are considered to be the edaphic factors that cause low diversity and high endemism. This paper aimed primarily to determine whether there is a relationship between serpentine soil chemistry and species richness on the Witwatersrand and to compare species richness of the serpentine areas with that of adjacent non-serpentine areas as well as with the species richness of the serpentine areas in the Barberton Greenstone Belt. The alpha- and beta-diversity of the Witwatersrand serpentine and non-serpentine areas was also investigated. A secondary aim of this study was to determine which of the non-serpentine taxa were more common on the serpentine than off the serpentine, which taxa were more common off the serpentine than on the serpentine and which taxa were equally common on and off serpentine soils. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity between the serpentine and the adjacent non-serpentine areas, but beta-diversity is higher between serpentine plots than between non-serpentine plots. Although soil factors do affect species richness and diversity of plants on the Witwatersrand to a limited extent, the concentrations of soil chemicals in serpentine soils are not sufficiently different from those in non-serpentine soils to significantly influence the species richness and diversity of the serpentine soils. The high, but similar, diversity on serpentine and non-serpentine soils on the Witwatersrand indicates that soil factors do not play a significant role in determining diversity on potentially toxic soils in the area.

AB In the 2002/2003 breeding season at Malgas Island, South Africa, 125 nests of Cape Gannets Morus capensis, of which at least one partner was of known age, were monitored. The age of birds at these nests ranged from five to 22 years. At five nests, the ages of both partners were known; ages were similar for birds younger than 10 years but dissimilar for older birds, suggesting Cape Gannets initially choose partners of a similar age but may replace lost partners with younger birds. First clutches, all consisting of one egg, were mainly laid in late September (estimated laying dates 15 August to 1 November). Of first clutches, 61% failed. Relaying took place at 11% of failed nests. Overall, pairs successfully fledged chicks at 43% of nests; no pair fledged two chicks. Breeding success was positively related to the distance of the nest from the edge of the colony, but tended to decrease as age increased. Height of nest and date of laying did not influence breeding success. Older birds bred earlier and further from the edge of the colony than did younger birds.

AB A polychaete, Capitella sp. I has been shown to degrade organics actively in organically enriched sediment below fish farms. Our aim of the present study is to enhance the biological treatment of sediment by co-inoculation of Capitella sp. I with bacterial isolates that possess high degrading potential for organic matter. We isolated a total of 200 bacterial strains from fecal pellets, burrow lining, worm body.. and sediment, and selected six of them for the degradation experiments in the sediment microcosms. With two out of the six isolates, tentatively identified as Vibrio sp. and Vibrio cyclitrophicus by 16SrDNA sequence, we found the TOC reduction rate was stimulated in sediment co-inoculated with the worms and each of the bacteria. In contrast, this was not observed in sediments inoculated only with the worms or the bacterium. These results strongly suggest that co-inoculation of Capitella sp. I with bacteria improves biodegradation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As the ecology and distribution of most tree species remain poorly understood, biogeographical maps offer spatial surrogates for analysis of biodiversity patterns. We used a 1 : 250,000 potential natural vegetation map to compare the current indigenous tree species composition of 250 0.5-ha quadrats surveyed around Mount Kenya (1999-2004) with the original species composition of ten potential natural vegetation types (PNVTs). The original 1960 vegetation map was based on intensive fieldwork and detailed aerial photographs by Trapnell et al. For each PNVT, we compiled original species lists from literature and herbarium voucher information. The percentage of species that overlap between the current list and the original list ranged from 30% to 75% for seven frequent PNVTs, but was only above 45% for dry Combretum savanna (DC). When only investigating the six to ten species with highest frequencies, these species were shared 70-100% for the four forest PNVTs, 90% for lowland Acacia-Commiphora, 67% for evergreen and semi-evergreen bushland and 50% for DC savanna. To promote agroecosystem diversification, ecological and socio-economic reasons for low current frequencies of most indigenous tree species need to be better understood.

AB The nearshore foraminifera of the oligotrophic Caribbean region are predominantly epiphytal, living on calcareous algae and seagrasses. However, their community ecology (interactions between and associations among species) is little understood. Cluster analysis is used here to identify guilds among the epiphytal foraminifera, a guild being a group of species that forms an arena of intense competition within which species' niches overlap considerably in habitat, time and food.
   Samples were collected monthly between September 1994 and August 1995 from (a) ualcareous algae and (b) seagrass rhizomes and leaf bosses from two bays around Nevis, northern Lesser Antilles. One bay was impacted by organic enrichment from a leaking septic tank. Data from both bays were combined to form a metapopulation, analysis of which was conducted using common species (i.e., those that formed > 1% of the recovery from any substrate in either bay). Q-mode cluster analysis using populations on all substrates of common species clearly separated the two bays, despite sampling of the same substrate in both, indicating that the bays occupy different biofacies. However, Q-mode analysis did not separate the different substrates in the individual bays, R-mode cluster analysis of the two-bay metapopulation based on common species revealed three clusters that are interpreted as guilds:
   Guild I A higher-energy guild intolerant of nutrient enrichment.
   Guild II A guild of rapidly-reproducing opportunists on short-lived substrates.
   Guild III A lower-energy guild tolerant of nutrient enrichment.
   These guilds are not limited to any one bay, but vary in proportion between the two, Guild I being most prolific in the virtually pristine back-reef bay on the windward side of the island, and Guilds II and III forming a greater proportion of the epiphytal foraminiferal fauna in the bay impacted by lower-energy waves and a flux of organic matter. Guild II shows a preference for the bushy capitulae of the alga Penicillus capitatus. In cross-correlation of 12-month time-series for the three guilds, the virtually pristine bay showed that they bloomed sequentially, at intervals of 4 months.
   The recognition of guilds clears the way for improved understanding of the foraminiferal community ecology of nearshore areas. Nearshore sediments in the Caribbean yield primarily foraminifera washed from phytal substrates, The palaeoecology of these assemblages can now be interpreted with greater confidence.

AB English sole recruitment has been linked to environmental conditions occurring during their 6-10 week pelagic egg and larval stages, prior to their appearance in nursery estuaries during their first summer. The purpose of this study was to predict the spawning locations of juvenile English sole observed in estuaries to assess the feasibility of passive transport of egg and larval stages. Current meter data were used to back-calculate the transport trajectories of 19 cohorts of English sole observed as juveniles during estuarine trawl surveys. Only six of these cohorts were predicted to be spawned outside the Oregon-Washington shelf system, assuming passive transport of eggs and larvae. Predicted egg and larval trajectories indicate that most of the English sole found in Oregon and Washington estuaries were spawned off the coast of Washington, with some spawning off northern California and central Oregon. Although these results are not consistent with the presumed spawning locations for the Oregon and Washington shelf, they indicate that passive transport assumptions may be adequate to preserve the larvae in the coastal system until settlement.

AB Biogeography is a discipline included in comparative biology that studies the distribution of organisms; the distributional patterns of organisms are analyzed through the application of different methods, depending on the question formulated. In this work the principles and advantages of some of these methods when the the principles and advantages of some of these methods when they are applied to the geographic distribution of the gymnosperms of Mexico are presented, and the convenience and applicability of each method in relation to the distributional range of the species is discussed. Particularly, in the case of Mexican gymnosperms, parsimony analysis of endemicity and panbiogeography have the disadvantage that their methods do not include those species with restricted ranges, whereas cladistic biogeography only includes taxa with phylogenetic information. In contrast, areograpky and predicted distributions consider all the species, independently of their distributional range and availability of phylogenetic information. It is concluded that the different bio-geographic methods can be used under the same analysis as complementary phases or components, despite the fact that some of them have been considered as antagonist research programs. This kind of studies generates valuable information that permits to extend the knowledge about the history of Mexican biota and to increase the knowledge on the biogeography of Mexican gymnosperms.

AB A spoor count was done to determine whether caracal spoor densities in the vicinity of the border of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park differed from those in the interior of the Park. The objective was to compare caracal densities close to the agricultural land with those deeper in a national park. Two long-distance transects, one along the Namibian border and one diverging from the Namibian border into the interior of the Park, were surveyed on a monthly basis. Spoor density, discrete track set distances and orientation of spoor to the road were recorded and analysed to establish use patterns for three distinct zones in the Park. The hypothesis tested was that increased spoor counts along the border should result from an attraction to the adjacent agricultural (cattle and sheep production) land. It is shown that caracals avoid the areas near the Namibian border during the hot season but increased their utilization in this region in the cold season. This implies that under conditions of low prey availability (cold season) caracals may move to the border and cross onto agricultural land to prey on small livestock, there. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We conducted laboratory trials to test the vulnerability of young white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, to predation when an alternative prey was available. In trials with two species of predators, we observed two feeding patterns. When equal numbers of white sturgeon and goldfish, Carassius auratus, were available, prickly sculpins, Cottus asper, ingested more white sturgeon. Conversely, northern pikeminnow, Ptychocheilus oregonensis, ate more juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, than white sturgeon in three out of four sets of trials, but ate more white sturgeon in one set of trials. White sturgeon size and the availability of cover did not affect the proportions of prey species ingested. Our results indicate that predation may be affecting survival of white sturgeon larvae and juveniles in the wild and could be one factor limiting recruitment of young-of-the-year white sturgeon in some locations.

AB We investigated the validity of spotlighting techniques for surveying and monitoring desert mammal populations by determining the effect of repeating spotlight transects on the relative precision of density estimates. Precision was modelled by calculating cumulative mean density and associated coefficient of variation. The effect of moonlight at the time of surveying was also investigated. The results show that spotlighting is a valid technique for monitoring some species, however the number of transects required to obtain pre-defined adequate levels of precision is species-dependent. Reasons for these findings are discussed and recommendations for future spotlight surveys for monitoring desert mammal populations are given. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Populations of live snails were studied over a 13-yr period in 18 Kenyan reef locations. Sites were divided among three levels of management (old, new, and unmanaged) And two types of habitat (reef lagoon and reef flat). Management prohibits the extraction of snails and predatory fishes, while both snails and their predatory fishes were removed in unmanaged sites. In reef lagoons I hypothesized that (1) fishing would result in increased total snail numbers in unmanaged reefs due to losses of their predators but no changes would occur in fully managed reefs, (2) the responses would be variable for commercial species depending on the balance between predatory fish effects and shell collecting; while on reef flats (3) commercial snails would be most abundant on managed reefs, and (4) there would be no population changes due to either high predation or stressful physical conditions. Most snail populations were stable with only 18% of the populations displaying statistically significant population fluctuations, and commercial species were more stable than noncommercial species. As predicted, reef lagoons had the greatest range of population densities with the fully managed lagoons having the lowest numbers. Numbers of noncommercial snails increased with time in all reef lagoons in support of the fishing effect, but against the stability prediction for managed reefs. Unmanaged reef lagoons did, however, have the largest recorded population increase. Protected reef flats did not have greater numbers of commercial snails compared to unmanaged reefs. They did, however, have a greater abundance of six commercial species while having the lowest noncommercial snail population numbers. Total reef flat snail abundance was stable except during the final sampling period in 1999 when the noncommercial snails increased in the new and unmanaged sites. This might be due to a chance or periodic oceanographic event, such as the 1997-1998 El Nino, but could also suggest that predation on reef flats is more important than I hypothesized. The snail assemblage appears to be stable but some large-bodied species such as Cassis cornuta, Charonia tritonis, Lambis truncata, and Turbo marmoratus were found in insufficient numbers to evaluate their status.

AB Red-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris) and Black-legged Kittiwakes (R. tridactyla) are morphologically similar, breed in mixed colonies, and nest at the same time, but they exhibit substantial differences in diet, rate of nestling provisioning, and foraging distribution. We cross-fostered nestlings of the two species to test the competing hypotheses that growth in mass of kittiwakes is constrained by diet (i.e. composition, provisioning rate, and quality) or by inherent species-specific physiology. Survival and body mass of cross-fostered nestlings at 30 to 32 days posthatching did not differ from those of conspecific controls. Black-legged Kittiwake fledglings had higher lean mass than Red-legged Kittiwake fledglings regardless of whether they were raised by foster or natural parents. However, nestlings of both species raised by Red-legged Kittiwakes were 50% fatter at 30 to 32 days posthatching than those raised by Black-legged Kittiwakes. Regurgitations from nestlings raised by Red-legged Kittiwakes consisted primarily of lanternfish and contained about twice the lipid (percent dry mass) as regurgitations from nestlings raised by Black-legged Kittiwakes. Consequently, growth rate of lean tissue was genetically and/ or physiologically constrained, whereas rate of fat deposition was constrained by diet. We hypothesize that the adaptive significance of lanternfish in diets for Red-legged Kittiwake nestlings is manifest in higher prefledging and/ or postfledging survival. Interspecific differences in energy density of food and food provisioning rates balanced each other so that rates of energy provisioning were similar.

AB The fatty acid profiles of wild adults and cysts of a population of the fairy shrimp Chirocephalus kerkyrensis from Circeo National Park (central Italy) were analysed at regular time intervals during the water phase of the pond, with the aim of relating eventual differences in fatty acid composition and profile to differences in environmental conditions. Four samplings were performed: at the beginning of adult life, at two intermediate stages, and at the end of the life cycle. The results show that lipid content and profile vary significantly in the samples examined, thus suggesting a relation with the fluctuations in the abiotic environmental variables, which, on their turn, cause variation in food quality and quantity.

AB The invasive success of alien Acacia species in the fynbos could be partially attributable to physiological differences to indigenous fynbos. In this investigation we tested the hypothesis that the greater N availability due to the N-2-fixing ability of acacias would result in greater Rubisco activity and photosynthetic capacity, relative to fynbos species. The gas exchange characteristics, leaf N concentrations and photosynthetic N use efficiencies of Acacia saligna and Acacia longifolia were compared with those of Protea repens, Chrysanthemoides monilifera, Dodenea viscosa and Leucadendron salignum. Compared to the fynbos species, the acacias had larger leaves and higher leaf water contents, but intermediate specific leaf areas. The acacias had more than 3-fold higher leaf N concentrations, but 50% lower photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency than the fynbos species. The acacias showed no clear photosynthetic advantage over the fynbos species, although, the former tended to have higher photosynthetic capacities and water use efficiencies. The lack of correlation between leaf N concentrations and photosynthetic capacity or Rubisco activity may have been due to differences in the utilisation of N for nonphotosynthetic processes and in the activation state of Rubisco. It seems unlikely that photosynthetic characteristics play an important role in the invasive success of alien acacias in the Fynbos biome.

Using a numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) as first approximation, the classification was refined by applying Braun-Blanquet procedures. The result is a phytosociological table. Classification, as well as a description of the communities are presented. A total of four communities, six sub-communities and four variants are described. Associated gradients in habitat or disturbances are identified by using an ordination algorithm (DECORANA). This information should contribute significantly to our present knowledge and understanding of the ecology of vegetation of disturbed areas in the Grassland Biome.

AB In headwater streams, the quantity of settling organic matter alone cannot explain the biological productivity that develops in sediments. Its use is partly determined by its quality, which in turn is related to its origin, either autochthonous or allochthonous. The aim of the study was to find a way to estimate the origin (autochthonous or allochthonous) of the organic matter consumed by benthic macroinvertebrates in small streams (Stralher order 1). Preliminary results led to the choice of the genus Gammarus as a biological probe. The comparison of two streams with different trophic budgets during two seasons and the analysis of 700 intestinal contents show that 1) the diatom/lignin ratio is the most meaningful parameter related to the origin of settling organic matter which can be measured both in sediments and in Gammarus intestinal contents, 2) large (<10 mm) seem to selectively feed on organic matter with a low C/N ratio, 3) Gammarus preferred the autochthonous part of the sediment organic pool over the allochthonous one. This selection seemed to be similar in the two streams though benthic organic matter budgets were different.

AB Seed production by native and naturalised perennial grasses was measured over 3 years in plots grazed at 3 stocking rates at Lansdown, near Townsville in north-east Queensland. The 2 naturalised grasses, Bothriochloa pertusa and Chloris inflata, produced many more seeds (360-2990/m(2)) than the native tussock grasses, Chrysopogon fallax, Heteropogon contortus, Sorghum nitidum and Themeda triandra (1-110/m(2)). Seed production by B. pertusa and C. inflata was highest at the medium stocking rate (0.6 steers/ha), with small decreases at both higher (0.9 steers/ha) and lower (0.3 steers/ha) rates. The other species produced most seed at the lowest stocking rate, and seed production declined at higher rates, Flowering patterns varied widely both between species and between years. C. fallax flowered earliest in the growing season, followed by T. triandra, C. inflata, H. contortus, S. nitidum and B. pertusa. If perennial plants of the tussock grasses are lost from pastures, they are likely to be replaced by free-seeding species such as B. pertusa and C. inflata, which are tolerant of grazing.

AB Interannual fluctuation of life-history traits in the mud crab Macrophthalmus japonicus (De Haan) was studied for a 7-yr period (1981 to 1987) in an intertidal mudflat in the estuary of the Tatara-Umi River, Fukuoka, Japan. Density of juveniles fluctuated greatly, and maximum annual density was low in 1981 to 1984 (22.0 to 44.0 m-2 ) and very high in 1985 to 1987 (98.5 to 188.6 m-2). In 1980, recruits may have been very few, though there is no data on or before 1980, because no crab of the 1980 cohort was found during the study period. Density of adult crabs was almost stable (11.0 to 32.6 m-2), perhaps because of density-dependent mortality. Under the high density conditions prevailing from 1985 to 1987 crabs grew slowly and longevity was shorter. Male chela and female abdomen were dwarfish, and females produced few and small broods. The changes of life-history traits under high density conditions were thought to result from strong intraspecific competition for space.

AB The European honeybee Apis mellifera is a highly successful, abundant species and has been introduced into habitats across the globe. As a supergeneralist species, the European honeybee has the potential to disrupt pollination networks, especially in Australia, whose flora and fauna have co-evolved for millions of years. The role of honeybees in pollination networks in Australia has been little explored and has never been characterised in urban areas, which may favour this exotic species due to the proliferation of similarly exotic plant species which this hyper-generalist can utilise, unlike many native bee taxa. Here, we use a bipartite network approach to compare the roles, in terms of species-level properties, of honeybees with native bee taxa in bee-flower ('pollination') networks in an urbanised biodiversity hotspot. We also assessed whether the abundance of honeybees influences overall network structure. Pollination networks were created from surveys across seven residential gardens and seven urban native vegetation remnants conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. There were consistent differences in species-level properties between bee taxa, with honeybees often differing from all other native bees. Honeybees had significant impacts on network properties, being associated with higher nestedness, extinction slopes of plants, functional complementarity and niche overlap (year two), as well as lower weighted connectance and generalisation. These associations all are indicative that competition is occurring between the introduced honeybee and the native bee taxa in bee-flower networks. In conclusion, the introduced honeybee occupies a dominant, distinct position in bee-flower networks in urban habitats in the southwest Western Australian biodiversity hotspot and has a major, potentially disruptive, influence on plant-pollinator network properties in these areas.

AB China is among the world's leading consumer markets for wildlife extracted both legally and illegally from across the globe. Due to its mega-richness in biodiversity and strong economic ties with China, Southeast Asia (SEA) has long been implicated as a source and transit hub in the transnational legal and illegal wildlife trade with China. Although several cross-border and domestic wildlife enforcement mechanisms have been established to tackle this illegal trade in the region, international legal cooperation and policy coordination between China and its SEA neighbors remain limited in both scope and effectiveness. Difficulties in investigating and prosecuting offenders in overseas jurisdictions, as well as organized criminal groups that sustain the illicit supply chain, continue to undermine efforts by the region's governments to combat wildlife trafficking. In addition to reviewing the key trends in both the legal and illegal wildlife trade between SEA and China, this paper examines existing legal and policy frameworks in SEA countries and China, and provides a synthesis of evidence on the latest developments in regional efforts to curtail this multibillion-dollar trade. In particular, it discusses how proactive and effective China has been in cooperating with its SEA neighbors on this issue. The paper also draws on the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) framework to suggest pathways to deepen legal cooperation between China and SEA countries in order to disrupt and dismantle transnational wildlife trafficking in the region.

AB Context Forest landscape restoration (FLR) was first defined in 2000 and has emerged from several disciplines, including conservation biology and landscape ecology. As it has gained in popularity, it is useful to go back to its origins and explore its similarities and differences with the discipline of landscape ecology. Objective This article aims to identify the relationship between forest landscape restoration (FLR) and landscape ecology. Methods It draws on a historical overview of FLR, an analysis of the definition of FLR and examples from existing FLR projects to illustrate this relationship. The article then analyses the convergence and divergence between FLR and landscape ecology. Results Three areas of convergence - landscapes, integration and connectivity - and three areas of divergence - process versus analysis, transformative and political nature of FLR- are identified and described. Conclusions Going forward, some areas of integration between the two disciplines are proposed.

AB Forage fish populations often undergo large and rapid fluctuations in abundance. However, most of their predators are buffered against such fluctuations owing to their slower pace of life, which allows them to maintain more stable populations, at least during short periods of food scarcity. In this study, we investigated top-down processes exerted by seabirds on forage fish stocks in five contrasted marine ecosystems, compiling numerous data sets on seabird counts, diets, energetic needs and prey energy content and abundance. Off Norway, South Africa, Peru, Sweden and Scotland, we found that predation pressure-estimated as the proportion of a fish stock consumed by seabirds-was generally low (median = 1%), but increased sharply at low levels of prey abundance. When prey biomass decreased below 15-18% of its maximum recorded value, predation by seabirds became a source of important additional pressure on prey stocks (similar to 20% of prey biomass is consumed by seabirds). An earlier empirical study advocated for keeping forage stocks from falling below a threshold of 33% of long-term maximum prey biomass in order to safeguard seabird breeding success, but here we further suggest that a threshold of 18% should be considered as a limit not to be exceeded for the sake of the forage fish themselves, and below which extra cautious management of fisheries may be required. Nevertheless, despite exceptionally high rates of predation on some occasions, predation pressure was not correlated with prey dynamics, suggesting an absence of prey entrapment due to seabirds alone in these five ecosystems.

AB Many terrestrial endotherm food webs constitute three trophic level cascades. Others have two trophic level dynamics (food limited herbivores; plants adapted to tackle intense herbivory) or one trophic level dynamic (herbivorous endotherms absent, thus plants compete for the few places where they can survive and grow). According to the Exploitation Ecosystems Hypothesis (EEH), these contrasting dynamics are consequences of differences in primary productivity. The productivity thresholds for changing food web dynamics were assumed to be global constants. We challenged this assumption and found that several model parameters are sensitive to the contrast between persistently warm and seasonally cold climates. In persistently warm environments, three trophic level dynamics can be expected to prevail almost everywhere, save the most extreme deserts. We revised EEH accordingly and tested it by compiling direct evidence of three and two trophic level dynamics and by studying the global distribution of felids. In seasonally cold environments, we found evidence for three trophic level dynamics only in productive ecosystems, while evidence for two trophic level dynamics appeared in ecosystems with low primary productivity. In persistently warm environments, we found evidence for three trophic level dynamics in all types of ecosystems. The distribution of felids corroborated these results. The empirical evidence thus indicates that two trophic level dynamics, as defined by EEH, are restricted to seasonally cold biomes with low primary productivity, such as the artic-alpine tundra and the temperate steppe.

AB Species' floral traits and flowering times are known to be the major drivers of pollinator-mediated plant-plant interactions in diverse co-flowering communities. However, their simultaneous role in mediating plant community assembly and plant-pollinator interactions is still poorly understood. Since not all species flower at the same time, inference of facilitative and competitive interactions based on floral trait distribution patterns should account for fine phenological structure (intensity of flowering overlap) within co-flowering communities. Such an approach may also help reveal the simultaneous action of competitive and facilitative interactions in structuring co-flowering communities. Here we used modularity within a co-flowering network context, as a novel approach to detect convergent and/or over-dispersed patterns in floral trait distribution and pollinator sharing. Specifically, we evaluate differences in floral trait and pollinator distribution patterns within (high temporal flowering overlap) and among co-flowering modules (low temporal flowering overlap). We further evaluate the consistency of observed floral trait and pollinator sharing distribution patterns across space (three geographical regions) and time (dry and rainy seasons). We found that floral trait similarity was significantly higher in plant species within co-flowering modules than in species among them. This suggests pollinator facilitation may lead to floral trait convergence, but only within co-flowering modules. However, our results also revealed seasonal and spatial shifts in the underlying interactions (facilitation or competition) driving co-flowering assembly, suggesting that the prevalent dominant interactions are not static. Synthesis. Overall, we provide strong evidence showing that the use of flowering time and floral trait distribution alone may be insufficient to fully uncover the role of pollinator-mediated interactions in community assembly. Integrating this information along with patterns of pollinator sharing will greatly help reveal the simultaneous action of facilitative and competitive pollinator-mediated interactions in co-flowering communities. The spatial and temporal variation in flowering and trait distribution patterns observed further emphasize the importance of adopting a more dynamic view of community assembly processes.

AB Invasive alien species (IAS) induce changes to community structure and functions which lead to a decline of endemic species and major irreversible changes to the local physical habitat. The distribution and the impacts of multiple freshwater IAS are not well known, and they have not been investigated simultaneously at catchment and at European scales.
   This study provides an assessment of the distribution and cumulative impact of freshwater IAS over European catchments. IAS occurrences were retrieved from the European Alien Species Information Network geospatial dataset and updated with the most recent records from the literature. The Cumulative Impact Index of Invasive Alien Species (CIMPAL) was derived by aggregating the impacts of species and their occupied area at catchment level by following three steps: i) IAS were scored by both the magnitude of impacts on freshwater ecosystems and the strength of evidence in the literature, ii) scores were mapped over the catchment area, and iii) scores were summed across IAS over the catchment. The distribution of CIMPAL in the river ecological classes of the Water Framework Directive was examined and increasing/decreasing patterns identified across ecological statuses.
   Results showed strong spatial variation in the documented distribution and impacts of IAS in Europe. Catchments with CIMPAL scores > 40 (range 0-55) clustered in Western European countries (e.g. Belgium and France) were characterised by plant, invertebrate and vertebrate IAS that had both a large impact in magnitude and colonisation at local (catchment level) and large scale (across catchments). CIMPAL showed statistically significant and increasing values from high to bad ecological classes in eight countries only (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland). This study provides comprehensive evidence of the distribution and impact of IAS within freshwater environments that could be used to improve understanding of the ecological pressures at catchment scale.

AB Context Interspecific competition can limit species distributions unless competitors partition niche space to enable coexistence. Landscape heterogeneity can facilitate niche partitioning and enable coexistence, but land-use change is restructuring terrestrial ecosystems globally with unknown consequences for species interactions. Objectives We tested the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and carnivore co-occurrence in natural and human-dominated ecosystems to assess the landscape-mediated impacts of anthropogenic change on coexistence. Methods We used boosted regression trees to model the distributions and co-occurrence of two competing forest carnivores, American martens and fishers, at two contrasting sites in the Great Lakes region, USA: a "natural" site largely devoid of human impacts and a "human-dominated" site with substantial development and a history of land-use change. We assessed the importance of climate and habitat variables for each species, measured spatial niche overlap, and quantified co-occurrence as a function of compositional (patch richness), configurational (landscape shape), and topographical (elevation range) heterogeneity per site. Results We observed significant differences in the effect of heterogeneity on co-occurrence between sites. The natural landscape exhibited little niche overlap and co-occurrence had a significant, positive relationship with heterogeneity. Conversely, the human-dominated site exhibited high niche overlap with variable effects of heterogeneity on co-occurrence. Elevation, snowpack, and development had strong, contrasting effects on marten and fisher distributions, suggesting that differential use of habitat and anthropogenic features facilitates coexistence. Conclusions Heterogeneity can facilitate coexistence, but too much may undermine carnivore coexistence in human-dominated landscapes where habitat and space are limited. Moreover, future climate change will likely erode niche partitioning among martens and fishers, with particularly strong consequences for coexistence in human-dominated landscapes and at range boundaries.

AB Alien plants represent a potential threat to environment and society. Understanding the process of alien plants naturalization is therefore of primary importance. In alien plants, successful establishment can be constrained by the absence of suitable fungal partners. Here, we used 42 independent datasets of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EcMF) communities associated with alien Pinaceae and Eucalyptus spp., as the most commonly introduced tree species worldwide, to explore the strategies these plant groups utilize to establish symbioses with EcMF in the areas of introduction. We have also determined the differences in composition of EcMF communities associated with alien ectomycorrhizal plants in different regions. While alien Pinaceae introduced to new regions rely upon association with co-introduced EcMF, alien Eucalyptus often form novel interactions with EcMF species native to the region where the plant was introduced. The region of origin primarily determines species composition of EcMF communities associated with alien Pinaceae in new areas, which may largely affect invasion potential of the alien plants. Our study shows that alien ectomycorrhizal plants largely differ in their ability to interact with co-introduced and native ectomycorrhizal fungi in sites of introduction, which may potentially affect their invasive potential.

AB Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are the most numerous flightless bird group breeding in coastal areas of Maritime and Continental Antarctica. Their activity leaves a mark on the land in the form of large guano deposits. This guano is an important nutrient source for terrestrial habitats of ice-free Antarctic areas, most notably by being the source of ammonia vapors which feed the surrounding grass, lichen and algae communities. Although investigated by researchers, the fate of the guano-associated microbial community and its role in decomposition processes remain vague. Therefore, by employing several direct community assessment methods combined with a broad culture-based approach we provide data on bacterial numbers, their activity and taxonomic affiliation in recently deposited and decayed Adelie penguin guano sampled at the Point Thomas rookery in Maritime Antarctica (King George Island). Our research indicates that recently deposited guano harbored mostly bacteria of penguin gut origin, presumably inactive in cold rookery settings. This material was rich in mesophilic enzymes active also at low temperatures, likely mediating early stage decomposition. Fresh guano colonization by environmental bacteria was minor, accomplished mostly by ammonia scavenging Jeotgalibaca sp. cells. Decayed guano contained 10-fold higher bacterial numbers with cold-active enzymes dominating the samples. Guano was colonized by uric-acid degrading and lipolytic Psychrobacter spp. and proteolytic Chlyseobacterium sp. among others. Several spore-forming bacteria of penguin gut origin persisted in highly decomposed material, most notably uric-acid fermenting members of the Gottschalkiaceae family. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Kenya's Tsavo National Parks are a critical conservation area and the only wilderness corridor through densely populated human-dominated landscapes stretching from the East African coast to Lake Victoria, separating extensive undeveloped grasslands south of the equator from the undeveloped semiarid bushlands to the north. At nearly 21,000 km(2), Tsavo is one of four lion strongholds in East Africa and part of Africa's most important populations of all other large African carnivores. To provide baseline data on the status of large carnivores, a track survey was undertaken in 2013. Lions and both hyaena species were widely distributed across both parks, while cheetahs and wild dogs were more patchily distributed. Spotted hyaenas were the most abundant, with an estimated population of 3,903 +/- 514 (95% CI), followed by lion (706 +/- 201), striped hyaena (679 +/- 144), leopard (452 +/- 98), cheetah (154 +/- 74) and wild dog (111 +/- 92). Tsavo's carnivores suffer from bushmeat poaching, illegal grazing and retaliatory killing, and increasing human numbers on its periphery. Given Tsavo's importance as a stronghold for lions and an ecological corridor, increased investment in effective protection is strongly recommended. Evaluating trends will require complementary techniques in light of intensive monitoring requirements.

AB The interaction of antlions and ants is postulated to be a predator-prey interaction in which the involved parties coevolve. Here, we investigated two issues of potential significance in terms of antlions and ants imposing selective pressures on one another. First, we determined whether trap-building antlions and sand-dwelling ants closely co-occurred in an area inhabited by both. In the field, we found that ants were the main potential prey items in artificial traps placed inside aggregation zones of antlions and that Formica cinerea workers comprised the majority of these ants. Second, we checked whether rescue behavior, a type of prosocial behavior displayed by F. cinerea workers and performed towards nestmates captured by antlions, reduced the hunting success of the latter. In the laboratory, we found that rescue attempts were very rarely successful. Overall, caution must be used when considering the coevolution of antlions and ants. Clearly, even though these two organisms can closely co-occur, the rescue behavior of ants seems to be unrelated to the predatory threat from antlions.

AB Animal migrations are a fascinating and global phenomenon, yet they are often difficult to study and sometimes poorly understood. Here, we build on classic ecological theory by hypothesizing that some enigmatic spawning migrations across coastal marine habitats can be inferred from the population genetic signature of larval dispersal by ocean currents. We test this assumption by integrating spatially realistic simulations of alternative spawning migration routes, associated patterns of larval dispersal, and associated variation in the population genetic structure of eastern Australian sea mullet (Mugil cephalus). We then use simulation results to assess the implications of alternative spawning destinations for larval replenishment, and we contrast simulated against measured population genetic variation. Both analyses suggest that the spawning migrations of M. cephalus in eastern Australia are likely to be localized (approximately 100 km along the shore), and that spawning is likely to occur in inshore waters. Our conclusions are supported by multiple lines of evidence available through independent studies, but they challenge the more traditional assumption of a single, long-distance migration event with subsequent offshore spawning in the East Australian Current. More generally, our study operationalizes classic theory on the relationship between fish migrations, ocean currents, and reproductive success. However, rather than confirming the traditionally assumed adaptation of migratory behavior to dominant ocean current flow, our findings support the concept of a genetically measurable link between fish migrations and local oceanographic conditions, specifically water temperature and coastal retention of larvae. We believe that future studies using similar approaches for high resolution and spatially realistic ecological-genetic scenario testing can help rapidly advance our understanding of key ecological processes in many other marine species.

AB In this study we explore species richness and traits across two urban gradients in the City of Cape Town. The first is the natural-urban boundary and the second is a socio-economic gradient informed by historical race-based apartheid planning. Plant species and cover were recorded in 156 plots sampled from conservation areas, private gardens, and public open green space. The socio-economic gradient transitioned from wealthier, predominantly white neighbourhoods to poorer, predominantly black neighbourhoods. The socio-economic gradient was selected to fall within one original vegetation type to ensure a consistent biophysical template. There is a marked shift between the natural and urban plant communities in the City of Cape Town, with little structural affinity. Urban landscapes are dominated by grass, with low diversity compared to natural counterparts. A significant ecological gradient of reduced biodiversity, traits, and in turn functionality, was found across the socio-economic gradient. Wealthier communities benefit from more private green space, more public green space, and a greater plant diversity. Poorer communities have limited green space on all fronts, and lower plant and trait diversity. Plant communities with limited diversity are less resilient and if exposed to environmental perturbation would lose species, and associated ecosystem services faster than a species rich community. These species-poor plant communities mirror historical apartheid planning that is resistant to change. Based on how biodiversity, functionality, and associated ecosystem services and ecosystem stability are linked, the results of this study suggests how significant environmental injustice persists in the City of Cape Town.

AB Traps are rarely used by animals, despite the plausible benefits of broadening the number and diversity of prey that sit-and-wait foragers might be able to capture. The most well-known trap building sit-and-wait foragers are among the invertebrates, i.e. antlions, wormlions, glow worms, caddisflies, and spiders. A plausible hypothesis for the paucity of trap building by other animals is that biomechanical limitations render them inefficient or ineffective at catching sufficient prey. Here I examined the literature to make a valued judgement about the validity of this hypothesis. It appears that antlion and wormlion pit traps cannot catch and retain the largest prey they might expect to encounter. Arachnacampa glowworm traps are functionally efficient, facilitated by the animal's bioluminescence. Nevertheless they only function in very moist or humid conditions. Caddisfly traps rely on flowing water to be able to capture their prey. Spiders are exceptional in developing a wide range of prey trapping strategies, from webs with dry adhesives, to sticky orb webs, to modified orb webs, e.g. elongated "ladder" webs, to webs with additional structures, and web aggregations. Some spiders have even redesigned their webs to minimize the high prey escape rates associated with web two dimensionality. These webs nevertheless are constructed and used at specific costs. While hard data across all of the invertebrate predators is lacking, there seems to be credence in the hypothesis that the biomechanical limitations placed on trap functionality can explain their limited use among animals.

AB Key message We propose a silvicultural-ecological, participatory-based, conceptual framework to optimize the socioeconomic-ecological services provided by dryland afforestation, i.e. addressing the limited resources in arid areas while minimizing the harm to the environment. The framework applies the following criteria to select multifunctional tree species: (a) drought resistance, (b) minimal disruption of ecosystem integrity, and (c) maximization of ecosystem services, including supporting community livelihoods.
   Context Dryland afforestation projects frequently aim to combine multiple ecological and economic benefits. Nevertheless, plant species for such projects are selected mainly to withstand aridity, while other important characteristics are neglected. This approach has resulted in planted forests that are drought-resistant, yet harm the natural ecosystem and provide inadequate ecosystem services for humans.
   Aims We suggest a comprehensive framework for species selection for dryland afforestation that would increase, rather than disrupt, ecological and socio-economic services.
   Methods To formulate a synthesis, we review and analyze past and current afforestation policies and the socio-ecological crises ensuing from them.
   Results To increase afforestation services and to support human-community needs, both native and non-native woody species should be considered. The framework suggests experimental testing of candidate species for their compliance with the suggested species selection criteria. Furthermore, regional stakeholders are involved in evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing the candidate species according to experimental results and stakeholders' values and needs. We exemplify our approach by describing our ongoing research project, aimed to evaluate several native and exotic Ziziphus species in the Middle East region.
   Conclusion The employment of our proposed framework forms a novel community of native and non-native woody species. We discuss the ecological context of this proposal.

AB Research Highlights: We evaluated influence of alien and native trees and shrubs on stand leaf area index to basal area ratio, indicating that both groups provide similar amounts of foliage. Background and Objectives: Foliage traits determine tree species effect on understory light availability. Direct comparisons of understory light availability due to different foliage traits of tree species are conducted less often at the stand level. We hypothesized that light availability is driven by canopy leaf area, and alien species contribution to canopy foliage will be similar to native species due to analogous patterns of biomass allocation in tree species. Materials and Methods: We studied forests dominated by alien and native tree species in Wielkopolski National Park (Western Poland). We measured light availability using the LAI-2200 canopy analyzer (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) and we calculated leaf area index (LAI) in 170 stands using published models of foliage biomass and data on specific leaf area. Results: Our study confirmed an impact of LAI on light availability in the understory layer. Analyzing the proportion of contribution to stand LAI and basal area (BA) we found that most alien species did not differ in LAI to BA ratio from native species. The exception was Prunus serotina Ehrh., with a LAI to BA ratio higher than all native and alien trees. However, the highest LAI to BA ratios we found were for the alien shrub Cotoneaster lucidus Schltdl. and native shrubs of fertile broadleaved forests. Conclusions: Our study showed that alien species contribution to shading the understory is comparable to native species, with the exception of P. serotina due to its dominance in the higher shrub canopy strata where it exhibits different patterns of biomass allocation than native trees. Our study explained that invasive tree species impact on light availability in forest ecosystems is mainly mediated by the increased quantity of foliage, not by more effective LAI to BA ratio.

AB Wormlions are small fly larvae that dig pits in loose soil to trap their prey. Similar to other trap-building predators, like spiders and antlions, they depend on the habitat structure for successful trap construction and prey catch. We examined whether sites at which wormlions are present differ in sand depth and particle size from nearby sites, at which wormlions are absent. Next, in the laboratory we manipulated both sand depth and type (fine vs. coarse) to determine their joint effect on microhabitat preference, the size of the constructed pit, wormlion movement, and their latency to respond to prey. We expected better performance by wormlions in fine and deep sand, and the sand in wormlions' natural sites to be finer and deeper. However, in only partial agreement with our expectations, wormlion sites featured finer sand but not deeper sand. In the laboratory, wormlions preferred both fine and deep sand, and moved more in shallow and coarse sand, which we interpret as an attempt to relocate away from unfavorable conditions. However, only deep sand led to larger pits being constructed and to a faster response to prey. The preference for fine sand could, therefore, be related to other benefits that sand provides. Finally, body mass was a dominant factor, interacting with the preference for both deep and fine sand: deep over shallow sand was more favored by large wormlions and fine over coarse sand by smaller ones. Our results suggest that several factors should be incorporated when studying microhabitat selection.

AB The phenology of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) could be influenced by meteorological factors and exhibits significant changes under different geoclimates. In the sub-optimal environment in Xishuangbanna, rubber trees undergo lengthy periods of defoliation and refoliation. The timing of refoliation from budburst to leaf aging could be affected by powdery mildew disease (Oidium heveae), which negatively impacts seed and latex production. Rubber trees are most susceptible to powdery mildew disease at the copper and leaf changing stages. Understanding and predicting leaf phenology of rubber trees are helpful to develop effective means of controlling the disease. This research investigated the effect of several meteorological factors on different leaf phenological stages in a sub-optimal environment for rubber cultivation in Jinghong, Yunnan in Southwest China. Partial least square regression was used to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and recorded rubber phenologies from 2003 to 2011. Minimum temperature in December was found to be the critical factor for the leaf phenology development of rubber trees. Comparing the delayed effects of minimum temperature, the maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range, and sunshine hours were found to advancing leaf phenologies. A comparatively lower minimum temperature in December would facilitate the advancing of leaf phenologies of rubber trees. Higher levels of precipitation in February delayed the light green and the entire process of leaf aging. Delayed leaf phenology was found to be related to severe rubber powdery mildew disease. These results were used to build predictive models that could be applied to early warning systems of rubber powdery mildew disease.

AB The feeding behaviour of crocodilians leads to the formation of particular assemblages by accumulation of carcasses on the bottom or at the edge of water points, in addition to the characteristic marks it leaves on bones, making crocodilians important taphonomic agents. We report here the case of a Pleurosternidae turtle shell, Pleurosternon bullockii (Owen ), discovered in 2014 in Angeac-Charente in south-western France. The shell shows a range of tooth marks left by a crocodyliform. Several elements designate Goniopholis as the most likely author of the marks and support the use of the 'nutcracker' technique. Some marks appear to have healed, while others suggest that this P. bullockii individual suffered from shell diseases. Many turtle remains and some ornithomimosaur dinosaur bones from Angeac-Charente bear marks of a crocodyliform attack.

AB Species richness and species-specific occupancy are key variables for biodiversity monitoring. While there are many field techniques to assess presence of mammalian species, their relative performance and cost effectiveness can be affected by biological variables that are related to availability (relative abundance, diurnal activity) or by traits that are related to visibility (body size, coloration, habitat selection) of a species. We conducted four transect surveys, driven during daytime hours and continuous monitoring with camera traps over a 16-week period in Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania. Transect and camera-trap surveys yielded estimates of 20 and 38 mammalian species, respectively. In absolute terms, diurnal vehicle transects were less costly than camera trapping, but in relative terms (cost/species), camera trapping was more cost effective. Logistic regression showed that mammal species with reduced availability (low relative abundance and low proportion of diurnal activity) were less likely to be detected during diurnal line-transect surveys. Species-specific detection probabilities and occupancy estimates were lower during transect surveys compared to the camera-trap survey. Similar to differences in naive species occupancy, method-related differences in modeled detection probabilities were positively correlated with relative abundance. Results suggest that factors influencing availability of a species explain method-related differences in detection probabilities and species richness estimates.

AB A worldwide decline of many bee species has been reported, but conversely some species seems to be in expansion. Nonetheless species truly in expansion may be overestimated, especially when they are considered as a whole, and information about intraspecific lineages is lacking. The objective of this study was to test whether the bumblebee species Bombus morio and B. pauloensis will be safe under future climate changes. Specifically, test if these bees will suffer geographic decline or expansion; test whether each phylogeographic lineage within B. pauloensis will respond differently in modeling of future geographic distribution given climate change; find stable areas holding high genetic diversity based on predicted future climatic changes; and test whether these areas are covered by existing protected areas. To reach the objectives we performed analyses using phylogeographic data already available and climate change information to model the demography of the panmictic B. morio and the phylogeographic lineages in B. pauloensis. Our results suggest that both species will suffer a reduction in suitable area and that the reduction in distribution is masked for B. pauloensis. When each clade was separately analyzed, the ones in the edge of the species distribution are the most likely to decline. We found a large future refuge in eastern state of SAo Paulo and state of Rio de Janeiro for B. morio and for the clades of B. pauloensis. This refuge seems to show high levels of species richness and endemism for different taxa. Thus, by protecting this area we will be preserving not only the pattern of biodiversity but also the processes that generate and maintain them for many other species.

AB Kelp forests dominate wave-exposed rocky reefs along mid-to-high latitude coastlines. The distribution and structure of kelp forests is determined by a range of physical and biological processes operating across varying spatial and temporal scales. Many kelp forest systems are strongly influenced by herbivory, and overgrazing by urchins, in particular, is a recognised driver of kelp forest distribution and structure. The ecological significance of herbivory by kelp-associated limpets, however, has received far less attention. We quantified seasonal population dynamics of Laminaria digitata and the blue-rayed limpet Patella pellucida on two rocky shores in North Devon, UK. For the kelp, we quantified density, percent cover, morphology, standing biomass, elongation and erosion rates, and C:N and phenol content. For the limpet, we measured abundance, biomass, and morphology, and for the limpet-kelp interaction we recorded observable grazing damage on the blade. Both populations exhibited typical seasonality with kelp growth rates peaking in spring, maximum standing biomass observed in summer and increased erosion rates in autumn. Blue-rayed limpets, which were recorded within kelp holdfasts as well as on stipes and blades, recruited in spring and peaked in abundance in late summer, with length and biomass generally increasing through the year. The area of kelp blade damaged by limpet grazing was low (a maximum of similar to 4%) and relatively consistent throughout the year, and the number and size of grazing scars exhibited limited seasonality. Survey data from other L. digitata populations in the UK suggested that the limpet abundances recorded in North Devon were comparable with other sites in the region. Although the impact of P. pellucida grazing on kelp blade tissue appears to be minimal, further research into cavity grazing by limpets on the stipe and in the holdfast is needed to formerly assess the impact these cavities have on dislodgement and fracture rates, especially when increased occupancy and grazing coincides with periods of intense wave action. We conclude that while herbivory is an important processes acting upon many kelp populations globally, the grazing pressure exerted by P. pellucida on L. digitata is unlikely to strongly influence population structure on UK rocky shores.

AB Larvae of pit-building antlions are expected to be more efficient at capturing prey than those of non-pit-builders. To test this prediction, feeding behaviors were compared in the same experimental conditions among pit-building Baliga micans and Myrmeleon bore, and non-pit-building Distoleon contubernalis. The number of prey eaten did not differ between species. D. contubernalis larvae used the walls of the experimental chamber as fence traps to capture prey. In the field, they were also found near edges of natural barriers, such as rocks, stones, tree roots, and plant stems. Artificial pitfall traps captured more arthropods near the edges of fences than farther from them. Larvae of the two pit-building species were located in the central part of the experimental chamber. In their natural habitats, the number of arthropods captured by artificial pitfall traps increased with pit size; thus, larger pits may be more efficient for capturing prey. In conclusion, pit-building and non-pit-building antlion larvae are both efficient hunters; the former hunt efficiently by making larger pitfall traps, and the latter do so by waiting for prey at the edge of the natural fences along which arthropods walk.

AB Precipitation and land use in terms of livestock grazing have been identified as two of the most important drivers structuring the vegetation composition of semi-arid and arid savannas. Savanna research on the impact of these drivers has widely applied the so-called plant functional type (PFT) approach, grouping the vegetation into two or three broad types (here called meta-PFTs): woody plants and grasses, which are sometimes divided into perennial and annual grasses. However, little is known about the response of functional traits within these coarse types towards water availability or livestock grazing. In this study, we extended an existing eco-hydrological savanna vegetation model to capture trait diversity within the three broad meta-PFTs to assess the effects of both grazing and mean annual precipitation (MAP) on trait composition along a gradient of both drivers. Our results show a complex pattern of trait responses to grazing and aridity. The response differs for the three meta-PFTs. From our findings, we derive that trait responses to grazing and aridity for perennial grasses are similar, as suggested by the convergence model for grazing and aridity. However, we also see that this only holds for simulations below a MAP of 500 mm. This combined with the finding that trait response differs between the three meta-PFTs leads to the conclusion that there is no single, universal trait or set of traits determining the response to grazing and aridity. We finally discuss how simulation models including trait variability within meta-PFTs are necessary to understand ecosystem responses to environmental drivers, both locally and globally and how this perspective will help to extend conceptual frameworks of other ecosystems to savanna research.

AB 1. Alien species are altering ecosystems around the globe. To predict and manage their impacts, the underlying mechanisms need to be understood. This is challenging in ecosystems undergoing multiple disturbances as unexpected interactions can alter the impact of individual disturbances. Such interactions are likely to be common in disturbed ecosystems, but have so far received little attention.
   2. We investigated whether interactions between an invading shrimp Palaemon elegans and another human-induced disturbance, the population growth of a native mesopredator, the threespine stickleback, influences a third human-induced disturbance, the increase in biomass of filamentous algae. Increases in both the native mesopredator population and algal biomass have been promoted by eutrophication and a trophic cascade triggered by declining predatory fish stocks.
   3. We used mesocosm and field enclosure experiments, combined with analyses of long-term trends in the abundance of the invader and the native mesopredator, to dissect the influence of the two species on algal biomass when alone and when co-occurring.
   4. The impact of the invader on algal biomass depended on the native mesopredator; shrimp on their own had no effect on algal growth, but mitigated algae accumulation when competing with the stickleback for resources. Competition caused the shrimp to shift its diet from grazers to algae, and its habitat choice from open to vegetated habitats. The native mesopredator, in contrast, increased algal biomass irrespective of the presence of the invader, by preying on grazers and inducing a trophic cascade.
   5. Our results show that the presence of a native mesopredator causes an invader to alter its behaviour and thereby its ecological impact. This demonstrates that interactions between invaders and other anthropogenic disturbances can alter the ecological impact of invaders, and, notably, that the impact of invaders can be positive and stabilize disturbed ecosystems. These results stress the importance of considering interactions among disturbances when investigating the ecological impact of alien species.

AB Alien plants invasion has negative impacts on the structure and functionality of ecosystems. Understanding the determinants of this process is fundamental for addressing environmental issues, such as the water availability in South Africa's catchments. Both environmental and anthropogenic factors determine the invasion of alien species; however, their relative importance has to be quantified. The aim of this paper was to estimate the importance of 32 explanatory variables in predicting the distribution of the major invasive alien plant species (IAPS) of South Africa, through the use of Species Distribution Models. We used data from the National Invasive Alien Plants Survey, delineated at a quaternary catchment level, coupled with climatic, land cover, edaphic, and anthropogenic variables. Using two-part generalized linear models, we compared the accuracy of two different sets of variables in predicting the spatial distribution of IAPS; the first included environmental correlates alone, and the second included both environmental and anthropogenic variables. Using Random Forest, we explored the relative importance of the variables in producing a map of potential distribution of IAPS. Results showed that the inclusion of anthropogenic variables did not significantly improve model predictions. The most important variables influencing the distribution of IAPS appeared to be the climatic ones. The modeled potential distribution was analyzed in relation to provinces, biomes, and species' minimum residence time.

AB Using a combination of geostatistical methods and generalized additive models (GAMs), we have analyzed the combined effect of spatial, environmental and biological factors on the density of Patella vulgata, Patella depressa and Patella ulyssiponensis, three limpet species coexisting in rocky intertidal areas of the Galician coast (NW Iberian Peninsula). The best multivariate GAM fit to the data explained, on average, 54% of the observed variation in density of these species, revealing the influence of spatial (latitude and longitude) and environmental factors (temperature). The influence of biological factors such as reproductive status and density of the species, as well as those of coexisting species, was also detected. The results suggest the existence of spatial and temporal segregation behaviours to decrease intra- and interspecific competition. They confirm P. vulgata as a migratory species and reveal P. depressa also as a migrant limpet, while P. ulyssiponensis belongs to the non-migratory group. Geostatistical analysis showed that P. depressa is the dominant species in areas more exposed to wave action, whilst P. vulgata dominates sheltered area. In addition, the three limpet species are spatially structured in patches, whose density and size vary according to the type of coast (Atlantic/Cantabrian) and to the degree of wave exposure. These results reveal the importance of carrying out assessments at the local level and in those areas particularly vulnerable to exploitation, such as sheltered areas, where densities and recruitment are lower. This information can be useful for decision-making aimed at the management of this resource, as well as for the efficient distribution of effort with respect to geographical fishing areas.

AB Woody plant encroachment on the rangelands has been identified as a major threat to subsistence livestock herding globally. Among various determinants, indigenous pastoralist management regime strongly affects rangeland vegetation dynamics at a fine spatial scale. However, mechanisms of how different vegetation functional groups respond to livestock grazing under complex indigenous management regimes are yet to be explored. By integrating plant survey with GPS-tracking of cattle movement, we investigate rangeland vegetation diversity and spatial distribution of grazing intensity in an indigenous pastoralist community in southern Ethiopia, and explore patterns of plant-livestock interaction. The results indicate that vegetation structure and composition are significantly different under three distinct indigenous land use types. Spatial distribution of grazing intensity is heterogeneous under indigenous rangeland management regimes. Both plant diversity and richness are lower given moderate grazing intensity. While herbaceous cover is generally lower at locations with heavier grazing pressure, moderate grazing intensity is associated with the lowest woody cover. The findings imply that maintaining moderate grazing intensity helps to balance pastoralist livelihoods and resource sustainability.

AB Spatial resilience quantification can be a useful tool for land planning and management in agricultural systems to predict the appropriate control of disturbances such as pest infections. We proposed an index of spatial resilience based on landscape indicators related to the abundance of the most important pest of Mediterranean olive groves, Bactrocera oleae. The index was applied in two olive regions in Andalusia, Estepa and Sierra de Segura. Additionally, spatial resilience was measured at different spatial scales to verify its capacity as an indicator and to provide appropriate solutions for each type of stakeholder. The spatial scales were: i) circular areas of 1500 m radius that involved farms and a wide area of their spatial context, ii) municipalities, and iii) the entire region (a quality production-designated area). At all scales, the calculated spatial resilience was lower in Estepa than in Sierra de Segura because of the proportion of olive groves in Estepa, the size of their patches, and their spatial connectivity promoting a greater homogeneity of the landscape; additionally, the proportion of scrubland areas and the fragmentation of the landscape were smaller. Finally, we discussed the direct implications of spatial resilience for land planning to favour pest control and indirect implications for the conservation of biodiversity in the framework of a sustainable agricultural production of olive groves. The application of the spatial resilience index would contribute to an objective assessment of the ecological quality of the agricultural landscape, a basic requirement for the perception of environmental subsidies by farmers from different administrations.

AB Over recent decades, concern has been raised regarding the management of Chrysocoma ciliata L. (Asteraceae syn. C. tenuifolia) in the eastern Lesotho Highlands. This shrub species is argued to be a Karroid invasive introduced anthropogenically within the last century. Historical botanical records in Lesotho are scarce, so the origins of this species in the region are as yet uncertain. Speculation is based on the contemporary abundance of these shrubs in overgrazed areas throughout the highlands. This study presents fossil pollen records for the eastern Lesotho Highlands which confirm the presence of this species intermittently throughout the past similar to 6000 cal yr BP. In so doing, this study refutes claims that the species was introduced anthropogenically within the past 100 years, and of its narrow definition as a Karoo species invasive in Lesotho. The intermittent appearance of this species in the pollen record, however, indicates that it is climate sensitive, colonising the wetlands under conditions unsuitable to other plant species. Evidence presented here calls for a re-evaluation of the categorisation of C. ciliata as an invasive in the Lesotho Highlands, and more critically, for a redevelopment of the environmental management policies which involve this species.

AB Aims
   Closely related species frequently co-occur in plant communities. The role of niche partitioning for allowing their coexistence has been called into question, but most studies on community ecology neglect pollination as a niche component, and thus potentially underestimate niche partitioning. Here, we investigate the importance of the pollination niche for determining coexistence in a biodiversity hotspot. We specifically test whether co-flowering insect-pollinated species of Erica, the most species-rich plant genus of the South African Cape Floristic Region, are characterized by different functional floral traits and different specialized pollination systems.
   Methods
   Communities of co-flowering Erica species were studied at three sites in the fynbos biome in the Western Cape of South Africa. We focused on five species with flowers that conform to an insect pollination syndrome. We assessed whether floral traits important for pollinator attraction and mechanical fit overlap by comparison of scent (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry), colour (spectrophotometry and models of bee vision), nectar volume and concentration and corolla morphology. Pollinator partitioning was quantified by comparison of floral visitor profiles and pollinator importance, calculated as the product of visitation rate, number of flowers probed per visit and pollen load for each functional visitor group among species within communities. Potential effects of competition were assessed by comparing visitation rates both directly and using anther ring disturbance as a proxy for lifetime visitation.
   Important Findings
   Floral phenotypes differed among species within communities in all functional traits. Visitor assemblages were diverse, including ants, beetles, flies, honeybees, moths and solitary bees. However, the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, was the main pollinator of all but one Erica species. Insect visitation rates were significantly lower for E. imbricata and E. calycina relative to congeners, but high rates of anther ring disturbance, which differed significantly in only two out of seven comparisons, suggest that long-term visitation rates are mostly similar among species that share pollinators. This study shows that coexistence of co-flowering insect-pollinated Erica species is not determined by specialization for different pollination systems. Pollinator sharing might rather lead to facilitation among co-flowering species, and floral constancy mediated by extensive interspecific floral trait variation might mitigate its potentially negative effects.

AB Connectivity is a key consideration in the development of networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). However, little is known about the early life history of many of the epi-benthic animals that these spatial measures try to conserve. Here, a pragmatic approach to consider connectivity in such organisms is adopted, as part of the Scottish nature conservation MPA designation process. The primary tool for the study was a basic bio-physical model, forced by a circulation climatology. In the general absence of comprehensive ecological information, the model accounted for the main biological characteristics of the benthic organisms under consideration of relevance to connectivity, namely, presence, spawning season and pelagic larval duration (PLD). The results showed that some degree of connectivity between MPAs is possible even for species with short PLD although those organisms are more likely to be vulnerable to local pressures, particularly in the case of less widely distributed species and those inhabiting less dispersive inshore locations. For MPAs further offshore and species with longer PLD, our simulations suggested large-scale advection patterns crossing large-scale environmental management boundaries. Although the study was an appropriate contribution to the MPA designation process, further refinements encompassing better basic ecological information, enhanced oceanographic resolution, more realistic representation of biological processes (e.g. spawning, larval behaviour) in the model, species presence within and outside MPAs and substrate suitability maps would provide future useful confidence boundaries around the general patterns derived from our study.

AB Landscape ecological networks (ENs) consist of landscape-scale conservation corridors that connect areas of high natural value within a production mosaic with protected areas (PAs). In South Africa, ENs have been implemented on a large spatial scale to offset the negative impacts of plantation forestry on indigenous grasslands. We focus on corridor width as a factor for conserving dung beetle and ant diversity within an EN. We also investigate the importance of natural environmental heterogeneity (elevation, vegetation type) and habitat quality (soil hardness, invasive alien plant density). We sampled dung beetles and ants in 30 corridors of different sizes, and at ten sites in a nearby PA. In addition, we also analysed dung beetles according to their feeding guild. Tunnelling dung beetle species richness increased with corridor width. Rolling dung beetle species richness was higher in the PA than in the corridors of the EN. The dung beetle assemblage within the EN differed from that within the PA. Corridors of various widths differed in ant composition but not in species richness. Furthermore, the PA and the EN differed in environmental variables, which contributed to differences in dung beetle species richness and assemblage composition. Within the EN, environmental heterogeneity across the landscape was more important than corridor width for driving species diversity of both dung beetles and ants. When planning future ENs, wide corridors (> 280 m) that encompass as much natural heterogeneity across the landscape as possible will best conserve the range of local insect species.

AB In urban and peri-urban agricultural production systems of Sub-Saharan African cities, diverse and functional complex weed communities may help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services and therefore indirectly support crop performance. However, effects of agricultural intensification and urbanisation on important weed diversity in the West African region had received so far little attention, although in Burkina Faso and Ghana up to 90 per cent of the population depends on agriculture as a main source of income generation. Hence, our research focussed on the analysis of changes in weed assemblages' structure and function of okra fields that were cultivated under different management intensities and were embedded into the rural, peri-urban and urban environment of two West African cities: Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Tamale (Ghana). We found a strong relationship between gender and market orientation of okra cultivation. Market orientation of okra farmers was also a major driver in shaping weed species assemblages and led to the development of a distinct weed assemblage in urban areas that even showed higher diversity in weeds' function. Morphological plant traits (life form, seed properties) were most affected by agricultural practises; distribution pattern of ecological traits (seed dispersal mode, pollination vector) seemed to be influenced additionally by environmental characteristics with less entomophilous but more ornithochorous weed species on okra fields within urban areas. Our results revealed that the management of okra was highly variable and that this variation was influenced by fariners' socioeconomic background leading to changes in soil properties. These in turn may alter the functional diversity of beneficial weed communities beyond changes in species richness by potentially harming the provisioning of ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination.

AB Shrubland ecosystems are less studied than grasslands regarding the role of domestic grazing on ecosystem degradation in the world, but particularly in Mexico. Of special concern is the paucity of research on soil hydrological responses to the impact of livestock. Here, we assessed the role that specific soil and surface characteristics play in soil hydrology as a response to goat grazing intensity in two different soil types, Regosol and Vertisol, in the Tamaulipan thornscrub of north-eastern Mexico. At each soil unit, a set of grazing regimes was identified, including heavy grazing (HG), moderate grazing (MG) and a no-grazing (NG) reference area, and selected soil properties and plant cover were evaluated. In Regosol sites, soil organic matter varied among all grazing regimes (4.6% higher on NG and 2.1% higher on MG with respect HG) and no dissimilarities on bulk density were recorded. For Vertisol sites, soil bulk density increased with grazing intensity (16% higher on MG and37% higher on HG with respect to NG) whereas plant cover linearly decreased from 86% in NG to 29% in MG and 9% in HG sites. Soil organic matter content for Regosol, and plant cover and soil bulk density for Vertisol appeared as the best indicators of water infiltration and moisture retention for the grazing conditions assessed. Differences in those key driving variables may help explain surface hydrology responses to goat grazing in rangeland soils of Tamaulipan thornscrub ecosystems and possibly on similar rangelands around the world. Clear signs of vegetation degradation were also observed, manifested by a loss in species diversity and plant cover, especially under heavy grazing. This reflects unsustainable livestock management practices that should be avoided. This study contributes to improve our understanding of rangeland degradation processes and justifies devising more sustainable grazing management schemes.

AB Ants are among the most diverse, abundant and ecologically significant organisms on earth. They have colonized almost all existing habitats, including urban areas, where they may pose serious problems for human activities. Here, we present different aspects of our studies on urban ants in the city of Buenos Aires aimed at collecting information on the species present in the city and at improving bait control strategies via laboratory assays. The use of these baits represents a control strategy that is environment-friendly as it avoids indiscriminate pesticide release. Moreover, we show that our baits exhibit higher efficiency when compared to a commercial bait, as it is optimized in terms of the ants' feeding behavior even when both have the same active compound and at the same concentration. This work represents the first integrative study on urban ants in the city of Buenos Aires and indicates that the control of invasive species in urban settings may be improved by increasing the scientific knowledge of the biology of the target species.

AB As the number of biological invasions increases, interactions between different invasive species will become increasingly important. Several studies have examined facilitative invader-invader interactions, potentially leading to invasional meltdown. However, if invader interactions are negative, invasional interference may lead to lower invader abundance and spread. To explore this possibility, we develop models of two competing invaders. A landscape simulation model examines the patterns created by two such species invading into the same region. We then apply the model to a case study of Carduus nutans L. and C. acanthoides L., two economically important invasive weeds that exhibit a spatially segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, USA. The results of these spatially-explicit models are generally consistent with the results of classic Lotka-Volterra competition models, with widespread coexistence predicted if interspecific effects are weaker than intraspecific effects for both species. However, spatial segregation of the two species (with lower net densities and no further spread) may arise, particularly when interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition. A moving area of overlap may result when one species is a superior competitor. In the Carduus system, our model suggests that invasional interference will lead to lower levels of each species when together, but a similar net level of thistle invasion due to the similarity of intra- and interspecific competition. Thus, invasional interference may have important implications for the distribution and management of invasive species.

AB The Asturian gooseneck barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes Gmelin, 1790) fishery has been managed through territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) since its inception >20 yrs ago. As part of this agreement, fishers are allotted exclusive extraction rights and active participation in management strategies. In return for these rights, fishers are responsible for gathering data on effort and extraction in the fishery. We used the extensive time-series gathered by the fishers to assess the sustainability of the fishery. Additionally, we used survey techniques to explore the social-ecological drivers of this sustainability. The fishery has succeeded in maintaining or increasing catch per unit effort in all TURFs. Furthermore, the system has received public approval, where 73% of the stakeholders indicated that the only way to maintain a sustainable gooseneck barnacle fishery in Asturias is through the current management regime. The system has contributed to the sustainability of the fishery via: (1) creating a window of opportunity for management of the resource; (2) the continuous incorporation of scientific information and fishers' knowledge into management frameworks; (3) empowerment of the resource users; (4) embracing adaptive capacity through flexible management guidelines; and (5) matching management scales with the main life-history traits of the species. As in any dynamic system, the gooseneck barnacle fishery is currently faced with important challenges that might impact its sustainability, indicating that there are no simple recipes for fisheries management. Nonetheless, this system provides a set of basic principles for TURFs, which may be conducive to adaptive and sustainable fisheries.

AB Savanna grasslands are characterized by high spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure, aboveground biomass and nutritional quality, with high quality short-grass grazing lawns forming mosaics with patches of tall bunch grasses of lower quality. This heterogeneity can arise because of local differences in consumption, because of differences in productivity, or because both processes enforce each other (more production and consumption). However, the relative importance of both processes in maintaining mosaics of lawn and bunch grassland types has not been measured. Also their interplay been not been assessed across landscape gradients. In a South African savanna, we, therefore, measured the seasonal changes in primary production, nutritional quality and herbivore consumption (amount and percentage) of grazing lawns and adjacent bunch grass patches across a rainfall gradient. We found both higher amounts of primary production and, to a smaller extent, consumption for bunch grass patches. In addition, for bunch grasses primary production increased towards higher rainfall while foliar nitrogen concentrations decreased. Foliar nitrogen concentrations of lawn grasses decreased much less with increasing rainfall. Consequently, large herbivores targeted the biomass produced on grazing lawns with on average 75 % of the produced biomass consumed. We conclude that heterogeneity in vegetation structure in this savanna ecosystem is better explained by small-scale differences in productivity between lawn and bunch grass vegetation types than by local differences in consumption rates. Nevertheless, the high nutritional quality of grazing lawns is highly attractive and, therefore, important for the maintenance of the heterogeneity in species composition (i.e. grazing lawn maintenance).

AB African savannas are highly seasonal with a diverse array of both mammalian and invertebrate herbivores, yet herbivory studies have focused almost exclusively on mammals. We conducted a 2-yr exclosure experiment in South Africa's Kruger National Park to measure the relative impact of these two groups of herbivores on grass removal at both highly productive patches (termite mounds) and in the less productive savanna matrix. Invertebrate and mammalian herbivory was greater on termite mounds, but the relative importance of each group changed over time. Mammalian offtake was higher than invertebrates in the dry season, but can be eclipsed by invertebrates during the wet season when this group is more active. Our results demonstrate that invertebrates play a substantial role in savanna herbivory and should not be disregarded in attempts to understand the impacts of herbivory on ecosystems.

AB Grazing ecosystems are often characterized by dynamic vegetation structure mosaics of short grazing lawns and tall grass vegetation that are important for the biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems. Grazing-induced trampling, causing soil compaction and reduced water infiltration, has been shown to be an important mechanism for lawn grass formation. However, insights in reverse bioturbation mechanisms were mostly lacking, especially how tall vegetation persists under continuous grazing by herbivores. In this study, we explore if defecation by large herbivores in combination with different groups of coprophagous macrodetritivores can locally convert compacted grazing lawn patches back to tall bunch grasslands with a more loose soil. Across a rainfall gradient in an African savannah, we separated the potential roles in this process between dung beetles versus earthworms and termites. We placed different mesh sizes under dung piles and studied the consequences for soil, vegetation, and hydrological properties. We found that soil water infiltration rate, soil organic matter content, electrical conductivity, bunch grass cover, and bunch grass biomass were significantly promoted by dung addition, irrespective of position along the rainfall gradient. In addition, the presence of tunneling dung beetles significantly increased water infiltration rate and biomass of bunch grasses, pointing at a new mechanism whereby macrodetritivores affect the structure and diversity of plant communities. We conclude that coprophagous macrodetritivores interact with large herbivores in contributing to the maintenance of structural heterogeneity in the vegetation of grazing ecosystems, with a special role played by soil-tunneling dung beetles.

AB Climate change is modifying the timing of the onset of winter rainfall in southern Australia, at times creating brief inundation events in seasonal wetlands, termed false starts'. False starts may cause abortive hatchings of fauna emerging from sediment egg banks because wetlands dry out before invertebrates can complete their life cycle or reach a drying-resistant life stage. A laboratory emergence experiment was used to determine whether the abortive hatching caused by false starts alters assemblage composition in the subsequent hydroperiod and whether the length of the dry period following a false start alters subsequent assemblage composition. Sediment for the experiment was collected from Lake Joondalup South, Swan Coastal Plain (SCP), Western Australia, because it has a relatively diverse assemblage of desiccation-resistant invertebrate propagules. Most wetlands on the SCP are seasonal and groundwater fed and the region has a mediterranean-type climate Two different habitat types, open water (OW) and fringing trees (FT), with distinct freshwater invertebrate assemblages are commonly found in SCP wetlands. We repeated the experiment in sediment from both habitats to determine whether false starts had the same effect on the two assemblages. Replicate sediment samples from both habitats were placed in microcosms randomly allocated to treatments or controls. To simulate false starts of differing dry-period duration, treatments were inundated for 5 days, then allowed to dry out for different time periods (10, 20 and 30days) and then inundated for 5 days. Controls were inundated for time periods equivalent to the total duration of each false-start treatment (20, 30 and 40days). FT sediment had higher organic matter and moisture content than OW sediment. The composition of the emerging assemblage differed between habitats, and emergence was slower from OW than FT sediment. Abortive hatching followed the false start in OW sediment, but subsequently the same assemblage emerged, showing reliance on the egg bank to resupply lost populations. Abortive hatching was not observed in FT sediment, where invertebrates survived drying during the false start, continuing to develop for up to 30days without surface water, because those sediments retained moisture. Provided that winter-spring hydroperiods continue to inundate OW for several months, these results indicate that invertebrates will be able to complete their life cycles and replenish egg banks following abortive hatching, demonstrating resilience to false starts. False starts to winter inundation rarely occur more than a month prior to the start of true' winter rains, so FT assemblages are resistant to false starts, showing the ability to survive dry periods of up to 30days. Furthermore, survival in damp FT sediment also gave these populations a head start', because the surviving assemblage was identical to the continuously inundated control. Assemblages emerging from beneath FT may potentially recolonise inundated OW habitat. So far, changes to SCP seasonal-wetland hydroperiods will be within the coping range of their invertebrate assemblages. As FT assemblages were more resistant to false starts, restoration schemes that increase shading by fringing vegetation should be encouraged.

AB Peninsula Shale Renosterveld, a Critically Endangered ecosystem, requires ecological restoration intervention on transformed areas. Yet there is little guidance due to very few renosterveld studies and limited knowledge of the mechanisms driving ecological responses. This study set out to test the effects of 32 interventions, comprised of five crossed factors (seeding of 31 species, fire, tillage, herbicide application and rodent exclusion), on vegetation recruitment on a site dominated by alien, annual grasses. Actual experimental responses were compared with predicted responses presented in an a priori ecological-response model. Responses to the interventions were highly variable. Sowing on its own was almost ineffectual, but restoration of species was enhanced when seeding was implemented with one or more of the other factors. In combination with other treatments, seeding made significant contributions to overall seedling density, species richness and canopy cover and is imperative if this ecosystem is to recover from extensive alien grass invasion. Several three-to five-factor interventions resulted in a full set of desired responses. Half of the responses predicted in an ecological-response model were confirmed. Study outcomes have the potential to guide future research and implementation of larger scale renosterveld restoration. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effective biosecurity is necessary to protect nations and their citizens from a variety of threats, including emerging infectious diseases, agricultural or environmental pests and pathogens, and illegal wildlife trade. The physical pathways by which these threats are transported internationally, predominantly shipping and air traffic, have undergone significant growth and changes in spatial distributions in recent decades. An understanding of the specific pathways and donor-traffic hotspots created by this integrated physical transport network is vital for the development of effective biosecurity strategies into the future. In this study, we analysed the physical transport network into Australia over the period 1999-2012. Seaborne and air traffic were weighted to calculate a "weighted cumulative impact" score for each source region worldwide, each year. High risk source regions, and those source regions that underwent substantial changes in risk over the study period, were determined. An overall risk ranking was calculated by integrating across all possible weighting combinations. The source regions having greatest overall physical connectedness with Australia were Singapore, which is a global transport hub, and the North Island of New Zealand, a close regional trading partner with Australia. Both those regions with large amounts of traffic across multiple vectors (e.g., Hong Kong), and those with high levels of traffic of only one type (e.g., Bali, Indonesia with respect to passenger flights), were represented among high risk source regions. These data provide a baseline model for the transport of individuals and commodities against which the effectiveness of biosecurity controls may be assessed, and are a valuable tool in the development of future biosecurity policy.

AB Understanding consumer resource population dynamics can be important to an understanding of the overall ecology of systems. For example, the tree-grass continuum dynamics of savannas, an important ecological biome, is influenced by the population dynamics. Here we investigate herbivory driven population dynamics of a savanna using a simple model of the interactions of the dominant players, namely: trees, grasses, browsers, grazers and mixed browsers-grazers. We introduce a consumption threshold that summarises some of the parameters and this is used as a guide to understanding the dynamics. This number is used in investigating system stability and sensitivity to parameter fluctuations. It is also used to identify degrees of ecological dominance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Fuzzy classification allows plots to be designated as transitional when they are similar to multiple vegetation types; the Noise Clustering algorithm allows plots having unique composition to be designated as outliers. We combined plot data collected using two different methods by transforming abundances to relative ranks and showed our classification results were robust to this. Of the 6362 plots analysed, 505 were assigned to previously defined woody vegetation types. Using the remaining 5857 plots, we defined vegetation types at two hierarchical levels comprising 25 alliances and 56 associations. Ten of the alliances are tussocklands, six are grasslands, four are stonefields or gravelfields, two are herbfields, one is rushland, and two are newly defined woody alliances. The classification defined compositional differences among well-known widely distributed short and tall tussock grasslands of the South Island. Notably it distinguished Chionochloa pallens, C. crassiuscula and C. oreophila tussocklands in wetter western regions from those dominated by C. rigida and C. macra in the east, and the domination of eastern South Island short tussock grasslands by Festuca novae-zelandiae and Poa colensoi. We demonstrate the distinctiveness of the vegetation of four naturally uncommon ecosystems - coastal turfs, northern gumlands, granite sand plains and braided riverbeds. Insufficient plot data precluded the definition of North Island Chionochloa rubra grassland types and many wetland and coastal communities. The 1846 plots designated as outliers mainly occur on warmer, wetter and less invaded sites than classified plots. Semi-supervised clustering allowed us to progress the development of an extendable, plot-based, quantitative classification of all New Zealand's vegetation despite data gaps.

AB Among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the proposed SDG 15 promotes activities that, inter alia, Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. An important potential contribution in achieving SDG 15 is through public programmes designed to jointly promote human development through poverty alleviation and improvement of human livelihoods and biodiversity conservation/management/restoration. An analysis of twenty public programmes with such joint objectives yielded twelve lessons learned. In addition to financial commitments, government and intergovernmental agency input for such public programmes includes ensuring political will and appropriate legal frameworks. Local communities and civil society provide input through traditional and indigenous ecological knowledge and stewardship. Appropriate shared inputs in development and the implementation of such public programmes, with communication between local community, broader civil society, the scientific community and governments will result in: better use and management of biodiversity; alleviation of poverty; security of livelihoods and better governance systems. The Ecosystem Approach of the Convention on Biological Diversity provides an ideal framework when planning and implementing new programmes. Application of the lessons learned to new public programmes will ensure that the answer to the question posed in the title is an emphatic Yes, and assist with the achievement of SDG 15.

AB Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small) is an invasive tree species that competes with native species in bottomland hardwood forests in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of the southern United States. While much research has been done on Chinese tallow in coastal prairie ecosystems focusing on its establishment ecology, there is little known about its impacts on stand dynamics in forested ecosystems, where it is a growing problem. A paired-plot design was employed in 23 different stands along the Neches River, near Diboll, Texas, to compare sites with contrasting abundance in Chinese tallow. The objectives were to (1) determine the impacts of Chinese tallow on stand dynamics, (2) examine its impact on the light environment, and (3) determine if edaphic factors were correlated with stand structure on sites with varying stocking of Chinese tallow. Stand structural metrics were measured in 2012 and 2013, and the below-canopy light environment was estimated using hemispherical canopy analysis. Soil samples were collected for analysis in 2013. For all species, stand density was greater in plots with abundant Chinese tallow, while basal area, quadratic mean diameter, and relative density were lower (p < 0.10). Chinese tallow presence was negatively correlated with overstory diversity, density of native species, oak density. We observed a greater maximum stand density index for bottomland hardwoods than has previously been reported (1200 trees ha(-1) at 25 cm QMD). Stand structure was most correlated to soil metal availability, yet relationships were weak (R-2 < 0.30), potentially indicating minimal differences in edaphic conditions across our stands. Management to prevent Chinese tallow from replacing native species in bottomland hardwood forests includes proper density management of stands in areas where Chinese tallow is likely to grow and early detection of gap formation to allow treatment of establishing Chinese tallow before it outcompetes regenerating native species.

AB The reproductive cycle and physiological status of five populations of Patella vulgata have been studied along the Galician coast from July 2010 to June 2011. The use of generalized linear model has allowed to obtain parameters such as Days and Day(95), which helped compare reproductive cycles among populations and allowed to determine the significance of the effect of size and degree of exposure on the start and duration of the cycle. On the other hand, a standardized condition index has been established, which enables the comparison of samples collected in different sites or seasons and composed by individuals of different size. Moreover, the use of a generalized nonlinear least squares model has allowed assessing the temporal variability of the physiological status of the populations and the effect of size and degree of exposure on its different components. This has contributed some useful information for planning a sustainable exploitation of this resource: sheltered areas turned out to be more productive, in terms of biomass. The reproductive cycle starts earlier and its duration is longer in sheltered areas. In addition, organisms showed minimum condition indexes during spawning periods, which makes these periods less suitable for the exploitation, both from a biological and from a commercial point of view. Larger organisms showed longer spawning periods. This highlights the importance of taking size composition into account, seeking to maintain a size structure which enables a reproductive period which is long enough to ensure future recruitment success.

AB Marine ecosystems generate a wide variety of goods and services, but are globally deteriorating due to multiple drivers associated with anthropogenic activities. Intense fishing pressure can lead to changes in structure and function of marine food webs. Particularly overfishing of predatory species at high trophic levels can cause cascading effects leading to ecosystem degradation, affecting both marine organisms and people dependent on them. In the Western Indian Ocean region, intensive fishing takes place and degradation of coral reefs and seagrass beds has been documented. One reason behind this degradation is overgrazing by increasing numbers of sea urchins. An essential step towards better management is to thoroughly understand the drivers leading to such changes in ecosystems. Against this background, the general aim of this study was to gain understanding about whether sea urchin predators in the WIO region are fished, and to identify the drivers behind the fishing of these species. The study had four objectives: Cl) to document if and how predatory fish eating sea urchins are caught in smallscale fisheries, (ii) to assess if, and if so why, sea urchin predators are targeted species, (iii) to assess if and to what degree local ecological knowledge (LEK) on ecological complexity involving sea urchins and their predators (e.g. trophic cascades) is present among local fishers, and (iv) to identify fishers' suggestions for management that can reduce problems linked to sea urchin overgrazing. The results show that all investigated species of sea urchin predators are fished by local small-scale fishers. Most sea urchin predators are not actively targeted, are not popular local food fish, and have minor use and economic importance for fishers. This stands in sharp contrast to their ecological keystone role by controlling sea urchin populations. The fishers' awareness and LEK were weak and partly lacking. Management suggestions targeted mostly the symptoms of food web changes rather than the drivers behind them.
   Based on the results we suggest that management of degraded ecosystems, as a result of food web changes, should encompass a wide variety of strategies and scales. Specific suggestions for sea urchin predator management are education of local stakeholders on destructive gear effects and food web complexity, further investigations of catch- and release fishing as well as the use of selective gears.

AB Agricultural land abandonment is rampant in present day Europe. A major consequence of this phenomenon is the re-colonization of these areas by the original vegetation. However, some agricultural, exotic species are able to naturalize and colonize these abandoned lands. In this study we explore the ability of almonds (Prunus dulcis D.A. Webb.) to establish in abandoned croplands in semi-arid areas of SE Iberian Peninsula. Domesticated during the early Holocene in SW Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, the almond has spread as a crop all over the world. We established three plots adjacent to almond orchards on land that was abandoned and reforested with Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) about 20 years ago. We recorded the abundance of almond seeds, seedlings, juveniles, pre-reproductives and adults in these plots, and determined their recruitment microhabitat. We found natural regeneration in all three plots, with almond density higher than 150 individuals/ha in each plot. About half of the almonds in the plots were juveniles, although 7% were one-year seedlings and 3% were adult trees. This suggests that colonization of abandoned lands is an ongoing gradual process. Most naturally established almonds were under tree cover, although this was not the most abundant microhabitat, avoiding the negative impact of browsing by Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) and domestic sheep and goats. In addition, the mean distance from the nearest seed source was 77 m. These findings suggest the action of mobile almond dispersers. Several Corvid species including the Carrion Crow (Corvus corone) and the Magpie (Pica pica) have been observed consuming and moving almonds in the study area. Our study has demonstrated that almonds are colonizing abandoned lands mostly as a consequence of effective seed dispersal by some animals. We show that almonds have the potential to become fully naturalized in the near future in many semi-arid areas of the Western Mediterranean. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Grazing systems in the high Himalayas are changing in response to socioeconomic factors and policy decisions. As well as effects on livelihood of herders, such changes may have significant impacts on plant species richness and composition. The objectives of this study were to explore how plant species richness and composition respond to livestock grazing in the high Himalayan rangelands. The study was conducted in three mountainous Protected Areas of Nepal viz. Sagarmatha (Mt Everest) National Park, Gaurishankar Conservation Area and Khaptad National Park. Species and environmental data were collected along perpendicular transects outwards from goths (semi-permanent stopping and camping points). It was found that the distance from goths generally represents a grazing disturbance gradient. The core areas near goths had low species richness per plot (alpha-diversity) where nitrophilous and grazing-tolerant species were commonly found. However, the highest species richness, total numbers of species and occurrences of rare species at mid- and farther distances from goths within 800m suggest that negative effects of summer livestock grazing were small and confined to limited areas near goths. Altitude, soil moisture content, percentage shrub cover and distance from goths were the variables significantly correlated with species composition, although the relative importance of these factors varied across study sites. This research can be used to inform decision-making about seasonal livestock grazing in the Himalayan rangelands, which should incorporate both ecological as well as socioeconomic considerations.

AB There is great potential of using probiotics in aquaculture to increase growth rates and improve the nutritional status of the cultured animal. In this study has analyzed the growth rate of abalone fed pudding probiotic Vibrio strain Abn1.2 -Alg3.1-enriched soybean protein. Vibrio strains Alg3.1Rf(R)-Abn1.2Rf(R) is agarase enzyme producing bacteria. Growth performanced of normal abalone were evaluated and compared with abalone fed pudding probiotic diet and abalone fed pudding probiotic-enriched soybean protein. Dinitrosalysilic acid was used to measured in situ agarase activity and viable cell count was used to determine whether the probionts Alg3.1Rf(R)-Abn1.2Rf(R) can colonize the gastrointestinal tract of abalon. Abalone fed a diet pudding probiotic Vibrio strain Alg3.1Rf(R)-Abn1.2Rf(R) -enriched protein exhibited a increased growth rate compared to abalone fed standard diet under laboratory conditions. The number of culturable cell reisolated from abalone fed pudding probiotic for 14 days ranged from 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g material. Agarase activity in the abalone digestive tract was higher in abalone fed pudding probiotic compared to abalone fed unsupplemented pudding. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Risk of Dengue Spread from the Philippines Through International Air

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID NICHE MODELS; VECTOR; DISEASE; BORNE
AB Epidemics of dengue fever occur every 3 to 4 years in the Philippines. The risk of a dengue fever outbreak in the Philippines has been heightened since Typhoon Haiyan struck the region in November 2013 because recovery efforts have been slow to progress. The structural damage caused by the typhoon resulted in an abundance of standing water, which can serve as mosquito breeding grounds. Should an outbreak of dengue occur, infected travelers departing the Philippines pose a risk because they may introduce the dengue virus into local vector populations (of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) at their destinations. This study quantifies the risk posed by potentially infected travelers departing the Philippines by using a network model that incorporates predictive species distribution models, demographic features of destination areas, and air traffic volumes. The analysis reveals that a majority of travelers departing Philippine airports deplane in regions suitable for harboring Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus; this factor increases the likelihood of further spread of the disease if an outbreak were to occur. Because it is impractical to implement all possible monitoring and control measures at all locations connected to the Philippines, this analysis ranks the set of candidates and thus allows surveillance resources to be optimally deployed.

AB The consequences of biodiversity loss in the face of environmental change remain difficult to predict, given the complexity of interactions among species and the context-dependency of their functional roles within ecosystems. Predictions may be enhanced by studies testing how the interactive effects of species loss from different functional groups vary with important environmental drivers. On rocky shores, limpets and barnacles are recognised as key grazers and ecosystem engineers, respectively. Despite the large body of research examining the combined effects of limpet and barnacle removal, it is unclear how their relative importance varies according to wave exposure, which is a dominant force structuring intertidal communities. We tested the responses of algal communities to the removal of limpets and barnacles on three sheltered and three wave-exposed rocky shores on the north coast of Ireland. Limpet removal resulted in a relative increase in microalgal biomass on a single sheltered shore only, but led to the enhanced accumulation of ephemeral macroalgae on two sheltered shores and one exposed shore. On average, independently of wave exposure or shore, ephemeral macroalgae increased in response to limpet removal, but only when barnacles were removed. On two sheltered shores and one exposed shore, however, barnacles facilitated the establishment of fucoid macroalgae following limpet removal. Therefore, at the scale of this study, variability among individual shores was more important than wave exposure per se in determining the effect of limpet removal and its interaction with that of barnacles. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the interactive effects of losing key species from different functional groups may not vary predictably according to dominant environmental factors.

AB Seasonality is a characteristic feature of savannas. Assuming plants are dormant in the dry season, long-term browsing by large herbivores (or their exclusion) in savannas should affect stem growth in the wet season alone. In addition, plant survival should improve with exclusion. A total of 236 dendrometers on six woody species in three large (> 25 ha) plots (all large herbivores excluded, elephants excluded, control-no large herbivores excluded) were observed from 2006 to 2013 in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Average monthly increment (AMI) per dendrometer was calculated and the interaction between exclusion and season (dry or wet) was tested species-wise. The AMIs of Acacia exuvialis, Combretum apiculatum, Dichrostachys cinerea and Grewia flavescens were generally reduced by herbivore exclusion, while the unpalatable Euclea divinorum was unaffected. Survival rates of C. apiculatum and E. divinorum were not significantly associated with exclusion, while other species' survival rates benefitted from exclusion. The dry-season AMIs of all species were significantly lower than wet-season AMIs, but dry-season AMIs were positive for two species common on footslopes (A. grandicornuta and E. divinorum), while being almost zero for species common on midslopes and crests, possibly because of hydrological variation on the catena. The results suggested that stem circumference growth of prominent woody species in semi-arid savannas is prone to reduction by exclusion of large herbivores, except for generally unpalatable species. Large herbivores may affect woody stem growth in semi-arid savannas by altering competition among plants.

AB Using calcified structures as natural geochemical tags to estimate levels of population connectivity is becoming increasingly common. However, the technique suffers from several logistical and statistical problems that constrain its full application. Foremost is that only a subset of potential sources is sampled, often compounded by under-sampling within locations at an overly coarse spatial scale. This introduces unknown error and prevents the creation of a range-wide connectivity matrix. To address this issue, we analyzed the natural geochemical tags of embryonic statoliths in the whelk Kelletia kelletii (Forbes, 1850). We sampled from 23 sites over the entire geographic range in 2004 and 2005 from Monterey (California, USA) (36 degrees N) to Isla Asuncion, (Baja California, Mexico) (27 degrees N). We then used geospatial statistics (kriging) to make continuous along-coast maps of embryonic statolith chemistry. This allowed us to estimate chemistry at unsampled locations. We used this new continuous assignment method to estimate the spatial error associated with assignment by the classic method of discriminant function analysis (DFA). Then, we compared the performance of the 2 methods at classifying unknown embryonic statoliths. We found large spatial errors often associated with DFA assignments, even when traditional DFA accuracy assessments indicated the method was performing well. The continuous method provided an improved assessment of uncertainty in assignments. It outperformed the DFA method in classifying unknown embryos to the vicinity of their true source. Geospatial statistics also provided useful information on other range-wide variables, such as adult reproductive abundance. As a proxy for larval supply, such information can aid future assignments of recruits. Our combined analyses help inform sampling designs and motivate the development of a new approach for population connectivity studies.

AB Effects of invasive plants on soil properties and microbial communities have been observed, but the mechanisms driving change are less obvious. The objective of this study was to determine the short-term impacts of litter from the invasive shrub Frangula alnus on soil properties and soil microorganims. In situ soil rings (6-cm diameter by 7-cm deep) received the following aqueous treatments: deionized water, dextrose, cellulose, Quercus alba leaf extract, and F. alnus leaf extract (n = 7) and were sampled 1, 2, and 4 weeks after additions were made. Microbial biomass carbon did not respond differently to treatments containing carbon (C) sources at any sampling period, suggesting that C quality had little impact on microbial abundance at this site. However, in weeks 1 and 2, soil treated with F. alnus had significantly higher total extractable nitrogen (N) than the control, dextrose, cellulose, and Q. alba extract (all comparisons for both weeks p < 0.001). We suspect that the increase in extractable N in the F. alnus-treated soil was due to enhanced N mineralization. In addition, changes to the microbial biomass C-to-N ratio in the F. alnus-treated soil indicated that microbial function had been altered. Overall, results from this study suggest that F. alnus leaf litter has the capacity to alter soil properties and microbial function by stimulating N mineralization.

AB The relationship between edaphic characteristics and vegetation growing on mine wastes in the Bor region (East Serbia, SE Europe) was studied using multivariate statistical analysis. The influence of edaphic factors on the composition of plant life-forms was also investigated, since it could reflect strategies for the avoidance of or tolerance to disturbances of ecosystems. The goal was to provide potential models for the restoration and management of this and similar mine waste areas. The results of this study imply that soil textures, nitrogen contents, reclamation technology and the presence of hydrothermally altered andesite as the type of bedrock significantly influenced plant colonization and vegetation composition of the Bor mine wastes. These edaphic factors explained 30.3 % of the total variation in the vegetation data set. It was also revealed that the pattern of plant life-forms found on the considered site groups corresponded to the soil texture. Based on their relative abundance on the investigated sites and relationships with soil properties it is concluded that therophytes and geophytes are unsuccessful primary colonizers of the Bor mine wastes. Hemicryptophytes of psammophytic character were the most successful primary colonizers and therefore potential candidates for anthropogenically-assisted natural recovery. This study suggested that an assessment of edaphic factors should be widely used in the characterization of mine wastes prior to reclamation. Estimation of their role in the development of existing mine vegetation should predate reclamation procedures. Thus, approaches based on adequate plant life-forms should have a more prominent role in future mine reclamation schemes.

AB Scale-area curves are increasingly used in ecology to predict population trajectories, based on the assumption that observed patterns are indicative of population dynamics. However, for introduced species, scale-area curves might be strongly influenced by introduction history. We examined the spatial structure of an invasive tree species (Acacia elata; Fabaceae) introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant and compared our findings with previous work done on a species introduced for dune stabilization (A. longifolia). A fractal sampling method was used to map the occupancy of A. elata at twelve spatial scales for ten quarter-degree grid cells throughout South Africa. Based on the fractal dimension (D-ij) calculated at different spatial scales we found that populations were more contiguous at plot (2.5-25 m) and regional scales (2.5-25 km) than at local and landscape scales (0.025-2.5 km). We argue that the lack of contiguous A. elata populations over 250 m to 2.5 km is not indicative of a low risk, but the result of the spatial structure of available land in suburban environments. When working with introduced species, scale-area curves representing fragmented populations at the edge of invasions should not be considered to indicate a lack of invasive spread/threat. Rather they can be used to identify "missing links" in the invasive introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum, but only if the life-history traits, introduction history, and area suitable for invasion are well understood and are used in interpreting the results. We suggest that their greatest value will lie in their use as a method for long-term monitoring of introduced species.

AB Modern developments in population dynamics emphasize the role of the turnover of individuals. In the new approaches stable population size is a dynamic equilibrium between different mortality and fecundity factors instead of an arbitrary fixed carrying capacity. The latest replicator dynamics models assume that regulation of the population size acts through feedback driven by density dependent juvenile mortality. Here, we consider a simplified model to extract the properties of this approach. We show that at the stable population size, the structure of the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges. Turnover of individuals induces a lottery mechanism where for each nest site released by a dead adult individual a single newborn is drawn from the pool of newborn candidates. This frequency dependent selection leads towards the strategy maximizing the number of newborns per adult death. However, multiple strategies can maximize this value. Among them, the strategy with the greatest mortality (which implies the greatest instantaneous growth rate) is selected. This result is important for the discussion about universal fitness measures and which parameters are maximized by natural selection. This is related to the fitness measures R-o and r, because the number of newborns per single dead individual equals the lifetime production of newborn R-o in models without aging. We thus have a two-stage procedure, instead of a single fitness measure, which is a combination of R-o and r. According to the nest site lottery mechanism, at stable population size, selection favors strategies with the greatest r, i.e. those with the highest turnover, from those with the greatest R-o.(c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The microbiome present in individuals of Talitrus saltator belonging to seven populations distributed along the Tuscan coast (Italy) was assessed by using Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of amplified 16S FRNA genes. Talitrus saltator is one of the key species of the damp band of European sandy beaches and despite of the large interest on animal-associated bacteria, only a few and preliminary data were present. Results showed a high diversity of the microbiome, composed mainly by members of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacillales and Clostridiales classes. The microbiome fingerprints were highly variable among individuals, even from the same populations, the inter-individual differences accounting for 88.7% of total fingerprint variance. However, statistically significant population-specific microbiome signatures were detected, and accounted for the remaining 113% of total fingerprint variance. These population-specific differences were mainly attributed to sequences from members of known host-associated bacteria such as Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, Cytophagia and Spirochaetia. This study showed the high complexity of the microbiome associated with an amphipod species and on the inter-individual microbiome variation with potential importance for understanding amphipod trophic and ecologic processes.

AB Bacteria associated with plankton are of importance in marine bioinvasions and the implementation of ship's ballast water treatment technologies. In this study, epibiotic and endobiotic bacteria associated with zooplankton, including barnacle nauplii, veliger larvae, and adults of the copepod Oithona sp., were characterized and quantified. Barnacle nauplius and veliger larva harbored similar to 4.4 x 10(5) cells ind(-1) whereas Oithona sp. had 8.8 x 10(5) cells ind(-1). Computation of bacterial contribution based on biovolume indicated that despite being the smallest zooplankton tested, veliger larvae harbored the highest number of bacteria, while barnacle nauplii, the largest of the zooplankton, tested in terms of volume contributed the least. Pulverization of zooplankton led to an increase in bacterial numbers; for example, Vibrio cholerae, which was initially 3.5 x 10(3), increased to 5.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1); Escherichia coli increased from 5.0 x 10(2) to 1.3 x 10(4) CFU g(-1); and Streptococcus faecalis increased from 2.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(5) CFU g(-1), respectively. Pulverized zooplankton was aged in the dark to assess the contribution of bacteria from decaying debris. Aging of pulverized zooplankton led to emergence of Chromobacterium violaceum, which is an opportunistic pathogen in animals and humans.

AB Savannahs are widespread vegetation type in Sudanian zone of Africa. As protected areas are often assumed to be the best way to conserve biodiversity, we assessed the effectiveness of the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in Benin, for maintaining savannah woody species composition, diversity and structure. Square plots of 900m2 were randomly established in protected and surrounding unprotected savannahs, and all woody species (dbh1cm) were recorded and identified. Species composition, Importance Value Index, densities, basal area and diversity indexes were assessed in relation to conservation status. The results showed that DCA based on presence/absence species data did not separate clearly protected savannahs from unprotected ones. However, some species were prominent in unprotected savannahs while others showed the same scheme in protected ones. Diversity indexes indicated a good distribution of species in the two savannah types. The woody density showed a higher value in protected than unprotected savannah at shrub layer level. The basal area was significantly higher in the protected savannah than unprotected one at the two woody layer levels. It can be concluded that biodiversity conservation in surrounding unprotected areas should be of great importance to increase biodiversity conservation by protected area whether specific actions were implemented.

AB Passage of a fire can break dormancy of the seeds of many plant species in fire-prone ecosystems. This response to fire is especially well known for the Fabaceae family, but has been poorly studied in Southern Brazil. We collected seeds of four Fabaceae species present in grasslands-forest mosaics of Southern Brazil: Mimosa bimucronata, Desmodium barbatum, Sesbania virgata and Collaea stenophylla. Seeds were exposed to different heat treatments (exposure to 60 degrees and 80 degrees C for 5 minutes, to 100 degrees C for 2 minutes, control without heat treatment); not all species were tested in all treatments. After the treatment, the seeds were kept in a germination chamber with a light period of 12/12 hours and temperature of 25 degrees C. Germinated seeds were counted every 2 days. The results were analyzed by randomization testing. Germination of D. barbatum and S. virgata was increased after exposure to high temperatures (80 degrees and 60 degrees C, respectively), while M bimucronata showed reduced germination after temperatures of 80 degrees C and C. stenophylla no response. This study is the first for Southern Brazil to show a positive response of germination for grassland species exposed to high temperatures, simulating fire effects. As the study presented distinct responses of species to the heat treatment, it seems important to conduct more works with other species from the family, in order to be able to detect more general patterns.

AB Interspecific competition is often asymmetric, and it can limit the spatial distributions of competitively inferior species within a community. When asymmetric competition involves 2 or more component species, the ranking of species' competitive abilities may form competitive hierarchies (all species of higher rank out-compete all species of lower rank) or competitive networks (at least 1 species of lower rank out-competes >= 1 species of higher rank). Expectations of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance among species in competitive networks are expected to differ from those in competitive hierarchies. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate the relative competitive abilities of juveniles of 3 closely related species of reef fish (bird wrasse Gomphosus varius, fivestripe wrasse Thalassoma quinquevittatum and the sixbar wrasse T. hardwicke) on Moorea, French Polynesia. We controlled for intrinsic variation in survivorship among species and found that competition among these 3 species was highly asymmetric, resulting in a simple competitive hierarchy (sequence of competitive ability from superior to inferior competitors): fivestripe wrasse > bird wrasse > sixbar wrasse. We surveyed densities of the 3 reef fish species on 55 patch reefs and observed significant negative spatial covariation between superior and inferior competitors, consistent with competitive hierarchies that limit the spatial distributions of the inferior species (sixbar wrasse). Our work demonstrates that intense asymmetric competition and the formation of competitive hierarchies may be an important determinant of resource monopolization and patterns of distribution and abundance in reef fishes.

AB Understanding models of networks formation is fundamental to explore the role of the structure in the functioning of the systems they describe, and their ability to respond to change. In this work, we aimed to understand whether and how the modular (or compartmented) structure of a network composed by macroinvertebrates and leaf detritus in six pools of aquatic system was related with the decomposition process. First, we evaluated the relationship between the temporal patterns of leaf detritus colonization and the modular subdivision of the network. Modularity was then related with the clustering of the pools based on convergent traits of leaf detritus consumption and environmental conditions. A significant relationship between the colonization patterns and the distribution of taxa and pools in well-defined modules was found. The modular and clustering subdivision of the pools showed a significant overlap, which revealed the intimate linkage between the structure and functioning of the system. Modularity shapes the functional architecture of the network, by increasing the spatial differences of leaf litter decomposition over time and the diversity of functional traits among detritus feeder. As a consequence, modularity influences the variability of communities' responses to disturbance, increasing the diversity and robustness of functional processes. Our results have also implications from a conservation point of view, showing the importance of habitat heterogeneity for the robustness of ecosystem functioning, potentially enhancing biodiversity with positive, long-term effect on the whole food web.

AB After the extermination of tigers in Sariska Tiger Reserve, Western India in 2004, three tigers were re-introduced in Sariska during 2008-2009. The present study examined the prey selection and dietary overlap between leopard and tiger after re-introduction of tiger in the study area. Scat analysis revealed the presence of nine prey species in leopard scat (n = 90 scats) and five prey species in tiger scats (n = 103 scats). Percentage frequency of occurrence of sambar (45.5%) was found to be the highest followed by chital (15.2%) > nilgai (8.9%) > cattle (7.1%) > common langur (6.3%) > peafowl (6.3%) > rodent (5.4%) > wild pig (2.7%) and hare (2.7%) in leopard diet. In the diet of tiger, sambar contributed maximum (41.7%) followed by chital (26.2%), cattle (19.4%), nilgai (10.7%) and common langur (1.9%). The present study revealed that both the predator utilized and preferred prey species in similar way, though there was difference in selection of prey species in terms of sex and age class as observed by kill records. The dietary overlap between leopard and tiger was found to be 94%. The results suggested considerable overlap between the two carnivores along diet axis.

AB Evolutionary trends and phylogenetic relationships in the Strelitziaceae (Zingiberales) were investigated using sequence data from ten plastid and two nuclear regions and a morphological dataset. The status of species of Strelitzia were evaluated in terms of the phylogenetic species concept. Relationships among the genera remain equivocal with two hypotheses emerging: (i) Strelitzia sister to a clade comprising Ravenala and Phenakospermum when indels are included, or (ii) Ravenala sister to the remainder of the Strelitziaceae when indels are excluded in/from the combined molecular and 'total evidence' analyses. Within Strelitzia, S. nicolai is sister to the rest of the genus, with S. alba sister to S. caudata. Strelitzia reginae is shown to be paraphyletic as S. juncea is nested within it, but more sampling at the population level is needed to confirm the taxonomic status of S. juncea. The highly localized and endangered Strelitzia alba is confirmed as a distinct species, as are S. caudata and S. nicolai, despite few morphological differences. Evolutionary trends are linked to changes in habitat and coevolution with pollinators. Climate change in southern Africa is thought to have restricted Strelitzia nicolai (or its ancestor) to the eastern coastal region, with subsequent allopatric speciation of S. alba and S. caudata, and relatively recent parapatric divergence of S. juncea from S. reginae.

AB Eudiaptomus gracilis is the most abundant member of the zooplankton, plays a key role in the food web of Lake Balaton (Hungary). In the present study the composition of bacterial communities of this copepod was investigated based on cultivation and molecular cloning. The cultivated bacterial strains from the gut homogenate samples of Eudiaptomus gracilis belonged to four different clades: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria. Clone library showed high species diversity, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, representatives of Deinococcus-Thermus lineage and Cyanobacteria were detected. The isolated strains were very effective in degradation of different biopolymers. Many of the detected bacteria are known as opportunistic human or fish pathogens (Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Chryseobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp.). ((c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB We examined the stomach contents of 287 individuals of rhomboid mojarra Diapterus rhombeus collected between June 1999 and May 2000 in three zones (inner, middle and outer) of a Brazilian tropical bay. Fish were grouped in five size-class (Total Length(1) <= 80 mm; TL2 = 81-110; TL3 = 111-140; TL4 = 141-170; and TL5 >= 171). The aim was to assess whether intraspecific spatial and size-feeding niche partitioning occurs and to describe the strategy used to explore the available resources. Crustacea and Polychaeta were the most important trophic categories and Harpacticoida (Index of Relative Importance, IRI = 66.9%) was the most preferred prey throughout all zones and size classes. The smallest individuals (TL <= 140 mm) occurred exclusively in the inner zone and fed mainly on Harpacticoida, Calanoida, sedentary Polychaeta and Nematoda, while the largest individuals (TL > 140 mm) fed mainly on Harpaticoida and Ostracoda. In the outer zone, the largest individuals feed mainly on Harpacticoida and Caprella. A high within-phenotype contribution to the niche width and a generalist zoobenthivore feeding strategy were detected. Partitioning the food items along space and growth seems to be the mechanism used by this species to decrease intraspecific competition.

AB Exotic pine invasion influences native wetland assemblages by changing environmental conditions such as hydrological regime and physicochemical characteristics. The expansion of cultivated pine has been a concern in southern Brazil and its impacts on aquatic biodiversity are poorly known. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) pine invasion decreases aquatic macroinvertebrate richness and abundance, modifying composition and macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups in ponds; and (2) beta-diversity between natural and pine ponds is determined mainly by species nestedness. Five ponds in native grassland and five in a pine-planted matrix were sampled seven times from 2007 to 2009. The pine ponds had reduced macroinvertebrate richness and abundance, and different taxa and functional feeding groups. Comparing ponds in natural and cultivated pine areas, beta-diversity as determined by nestedness did not differ from the value resulting from the turnover. Reduction of surface in ponds in pine areas may be one of the main causes for the lower macroinvertebrate richness and abundance because many taxa do not have adaptations to tolerate or escape the dry phase. Our results suggest that pine invasion has a negative impact on macroinvertebrate structure in southern Brazil coastal ponds.

AB Aerial surveys using direct counts of animals are commonly used to estimate deer abundance. Forward-looking infrared (FUR) technology is increasingly replacing traditional methods such as visual observation from helicopters. Our goals were to compare fixed-wing FUR and visual, helicopter-based counts in terms of relative bias, influence of snow cover and cost. We surveyed five plots: four 41.4 km(2) plots with free-ranging white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus populations in Wisconsin and a 5.3 km(2) plot with a white-tailed deer population contained by a high fence in Michigan. We surveyed plots using both fixed-wing FLIR and helicopters, both with snow cover and without snow. None of the methods counted more deer than the other when snow was present. Helicopter counts were lower in the absence of snow, but lack of snow cover did not apparently affect FUR. Group sizes of observed deer were similar regardless of survey method or season. We found that FLIR counts were generally precise (CV = 0.089) when two or three replicate surveys were conducted within a few hours. However, at the plot level, FLIR counts differed greatly between seasons, suggesting that detection rates vary over larger time scales. Fixed-wing FLIR was more costly than visual observers in helicopters and was more restrictive in terms of acceptable survey conditions. Further research is needed to understand what factors influence the detection of deer during FLIR surveys.

AB In managed rangelands periods of low primary productivity determine troughs of forage availability, constraining animal production year-round. Although alternative tools to increase forage availability during critical seasons exists, most of them are unaffordable and short-lived in marginal areas. We explore the potential benefits of deciduous tree plantations favoring winter forage productivity by comparing aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) patterns in herbaceous understory to tree plantations and natural grasslands in the Pampas (Argentina). These temperate subhumid grasslands are characterized by the coexistence of winter species, mainly C3 grasses of the native genera Stipa, Piptochaetium, and Bromus and the exotic genera Lolium and Festuca) and summer species (mainly C4 grasses of the native genera Paspalum, Bothriochloa, and Stenotaphrum) that replace each other throughout the seasons, with domination of the latter. We hypothesize that the natural decoupling of growing seasons between winter deciduous trees and winter grasses could provide the basis for the sustainable promotion of winter forage. We measured ANPP on two 23-year-old Populus deltoides plantations and their understory and compared them with adjacent open grasslands. Afforested stands had 55-75% higher annual ANPP than their non-afforested neighbors, with trees contributing similar to 70% to total ANPP. Herbaceous canopies beneath plantations achieved about half of the ANPP observed in non-afforested situations with a contrasting seasonal distribution associated with shifts from C4 to C3 grass dominance. Winter ANPP, the most critical source of forage in these grazing systems, was similar or higher in the herbaceous understory of tree plantations to that on their non-afforested counterparts, suggesting that mixed systems involving deciduous trees and understory pastures are a valid and viable option in the region.

AB The influence of functional traits on floristic patterns remains poorly understood in tropical rain forests. This contribution explores whether patterns of endemism of plant species are influenced by their life form and mode of dispersal. We used a comprehensive dataset of 3650 georeferenced plant specimens collected in Cameroon belonging to 115 taxa of Orchidaceae and 207 Rubiaceae endemic to Atlantic Central Africa. Species diversity of each family was compared using raw species richness (SR) and an index of species diversity (S (k) ) using subsampling procedure to correct for sampling bias. Measures were compared at three scales (square grids of one half-degree and one-degree per side and ecoregions) and according to elevation and continentality gradients. Species similarity between grid cells was measured using the sample-size corrected NNESS index. For both families, SR and S (k) decreased along the continentality gradient. In forest habitats below 1500 m altitude, both Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae show similar endemism patterns, but they differ in intensity. At higher altitudes, S (k) is higher for orchids due to the presence of endemic terrestrial taxa in grasslands, where the endemic Rubiaceae flora is rather poor. Substantial endemism observed at the ecoregion level and turnover analysis supported the role of the Sanaga River as a phytogeographical boundary. Similar endemism patterns were observed in lowland forests for Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae, even though Orchidaceae are assumed to have better long distance dispersal capabilities. The dispersal ability of Orchidaceae could be limited by the need of specific mycorhizal fungi for seed germination or host specificity for epiphytic orchids.

AB Aim
   (1) To determine the relative need for conservation assessments of vascular plant species among the world's ecoregions given under-assessed species distributions; (2) to evaluate the challenge posed by the lack of financial resources on species assessment efforts; and (3) to demonstrate the utility of nonlinear mixed-effects models with both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic error structures in the identification of species-rich ecoregions.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   We identified the world's ecoregions that contain the highest vascular plant species richness after controlling for area using species-area relationship (SAR) models built within a mixed-effects multi-model framework. Using quantitative thresholds, ecoregions with the highest plant species richness, historical habitat loss and projected increase in human population density were deemed to be most in need of conservation assessments of plant species. We used generalized linear models to test if countries that overlap with highly important ecoregions are poorer compared with others.
   Results
   We classed ecoregions into nine categories based on the relative need for conservation assessments of vascular plant species. Ecoregions of highest relative need are found mostly in the tropics, particularly Southeast Asia, Central America, Tropical Andes and the Cerrado of South America, and the East African montane region and its surrounding areas. Countries overlapping with ecoregions deemed important for conservation assessments are poorer as measured by their capita gross national income than the other countries. The nonlinear mixed modelling framework was effective in reducing residual spatial autocorrelation compared with nonlinear models comprised of only fixed effects. In contrasting multiple SAR models to identify species-rich ecoregions, there was not one SAR model that fitted best across all biomes. Not all SAR models displayed homoscedastic errors; therefore it is important to consider models with both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic error structures.
   Main conclusions
   We propose that conservation assessments should be conducted first in ecoregions with the greatest predicted species richness, historical habitat loss and future human population increase. As ecoregions deemed to be important for conservation assessments are located in the poorest countries, we urge international aid agencies and botanic gardens to cooperate with both local and international scientists to fund and implement conservation assessment programmes there.

AB In the face of increasing availability and use of distribution data, large-scale approaches of mapping species distribution patterns have become a central component of development of large-scale conservation policies. Particularly in tropical regions and for non-vertebrate taxa, knowledge on distribution patterns at large spatial extents remains woefully limited. Datasets are often geographically and taxonomically incomplete, have presence-only character and lack abundance information. One intermediate step for the application of such data common to most approaches is the construction of species geographic ranges. In this study, we investigated the effects of different methods for constructing species ranges on range attributes and species richness. We selected the Neotropical palm genus Bactris as a typical example for a diverse tropical plant taxon that is comparatively well researched, but under collected. For 48 Bactris species, we compared point-to-grid ranges, expert ranges, convex polygons and modelled ranges. Range attributes and resulting species richness patterns differed tremendously and were constrained by incompleteness of the respective data type and by the errors associated to the method itself. The consequences of applying different methods to construct species ranges highlighted here can aid in selecting appropriate methods for analysing distribution data at large geographic scales.

AB Background and aims Herbaceous-shrubby communities in the Gran Sabana (Great Savanna) Plateau of Venezuela grow under non-zonal conditions. We speculated that this would produce specific patterns of reproductive phenology within these different soil-climate-vegetation associations. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the reproductive phenology patterns of four herbaceous-shrubby communities are determined by climate, plant life-forms and soil properties.
   Methodology The reproductive phenology of 233 plant species of the Gran Sabana Plateau of the Venezuelan Guayana Highlands was studied taking into account their life-forms (i.e. trees, shrubs, climbers, annual herbs, perennial herbs, epiphytes and parasites/hemiparasites) in four herbaceous-shrubby communities: (i) shrubland, (ii) secondary bush, (iii) savanna and (iv) broad-leaved meadow. Patterns of flowering, and occurrence of unripe fruit and ripe fruit were studied at two levels of intensity for 24 months within a 5-year span. Two phenological records for each month of the year and between two and four replicates for each community type were made. Randomly selected 2-3 ha plots were used. General phenological patterns were established using <25% of the plants of each species in each plot to give the total duration of each phenological phase. High-intensity phenological patterns were established using >25% of individuals in each plot to establish times of high abundance of flowers, and presence of unripe fruit and/or ripe fruit on individual plants. This generated phenological peaks for each species.
   Principal results Non-seasonality of general flowering and unripe fruiting in each of the four communities was related to non-seasonal flowering and unripe fruiting patterns in the plant life-forms studied and to low variation in precipitation throughout the year. Flowering activity in the shrubland and broad-leaved meadow peaked twice. The bush community had only one flowering peak while the savanna gave a non-seasonal flowering peak. The peak unripe fruiting pattern was not clearly related to unripe fruit phenological patterns of the most abundant life-forms. Unripe fruit patterns and precipitation were only correlated for shrubs, climbers and trees in the shrubland. Ripe fruiting patterns peaked during the short-dry season in the bush and shrubland, and were negatively correlated with precipitation in the shrubland. General and peak ripe fruiting patterns were non-seasonal in the savanna and broad-leaved meadow and related to the dominance of herbaceous species with prolonged ripe fruiting times, low climate seasonality, high plant species richness and diversity, and dispersal syndromes.
   Conclusions The reproductive phenology of the herbaceous-shrubby communities is mainly influenced by the composition of the life-forms, the precipitation regime and soil type.

AB The effect of three arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on phosphorus (P) nutrient activation and acquisition by maize from spatially heterogeneous sand was investigated using dual-mesh packages enriched with different P concentrations and compared with non-mycorrhizal cotrols. As would be expected the AM fungi significantly enhanced leaf photosynthetic rate and the biomass and P concentrations in shoots and roots. All three fungi (Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae and Glomus etunicatum) displayed the capacity to dissolve inorganic P and promoted P nutrient availability in the packages (P patches). G. etunicatum showed the largest effect comparing with Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae, particularly in packages with high concentrations of P. Possible mechanisms involved include the acidification of the P patches by the AM fungi, promotion of the dissolution of the P, and more marked effects of the three fungal isolates with increasing enrichment of P in the patches. Inoculation with G. etunicatum resulted in greater acidification compared to the other two fungi. We conclude that AM fungi can promote P availability by acidifying the soil and consequently exploiting the P in nutrient patches and by facilitating the growth and development of the host plants.

AB The jaguar (Panthera onca) and puma (Puma concolor) are the largest felids of the American Continent and live in sympatry along most of their distribution. Their tracks are frequently used for research and management purposes, but tracks are difficult to distinguish from each other and can be confused with those of big canids. We used tracks from pumas, jaguars, large dogs, and maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) to evaluate traditional qualitative and quantitative identification methods and to elaborate multivariate methods to differentiate big canids versus big felids and puma versus jaguar tracks (n = 167 tracks from 18 zoos). We tested accuracy of qualitative classification through an identification exercise with field-experienced volunteers. Qualitative methods were useful but there was high variability in accuracy of track identification. Most of the traditional quantitative methods showed an elevated percentage of misclassified tracks (>= 20%). We used stepwise discriminant function analysis to develop 3 discriminant models: 1 for big canid versus big felid track identification and 2 alternative models for jaguar versus puma track differentiation using 1) best discriminant variables, and 2) size-independent variables. These models had high classification performance, with <10% of error in the validation procedures. We used simpler discriminant models in the elaboration of identification keys to facilitate track classification process. We developed an accurate method for track identification, capable of distinguishing between big felids (puma and jaguar) and large canids (dog and maned wolf) tracks and between jaguar and puma tracks. Application of our method will allow a more reliable use of tracks in puma and jaguar research and it will help managers using tracks as indicators of these felids' presence for conservation or management purposes.

AB Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are ubiquitous photoprotective compounds in aquatic environments. MAAs are synthesized by a wide variety of organisms (i.e. bacteria, fungi and algae) and their production is photoinducible by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (280-400 nm) and/or photosynthetically active radiation (400-750 nm). Most animals however, are unable to synthesize MAAs and must acquire these compounds through their diet or from symbiotic organisms. In this paper, we investigate the possible sources of MAAs and factors (temperature and initial MAA concentration) that may affect their bioaccumulation in freshwater copepods. We found that MAA accumulation may occur even if the copepods are cultured on a MAA-free diet. In addition, we found that the bacteriostatic antibiotic, chloramphenicol, inhibits the bioaccumulation of MAAs. These two pieces of evidence suggest that the source of MAAs in these copepods may be prokaryotic organisms in close association with the animals. The two factors investigated in this study, temperature and initial MAA concentrations, were found to affect the rates at which MAAs are accumulated. Temperature had positive effects on both uptake and elimination rates. On the other hand, the rate of uptake decreased at the highest assayed initial MAA concentration, probably because the concentration of MAAs was already close to saturation.

AB P>Catch composition, relative abundance and diversity of fish catches in open access and three old fisheries closures were compared and contrasted with previous ecological studies. There was less variation in catch community composition among the fishing grounds than the closures, suggesting that fishing has homogenised catch composition. The trap survey found that some parrotfish [Leptoscarus vaigiensis (Quoy &Gaimard), Calotomus carolinus (Valenciennes) and Scarus ghobban Forsskal] were relatively more common and that some important predators of macro-invertebrates [Balistapus undulatus (Mungo Park) and Cheilinus chlorourus (Bloch)] were less common in the fishing grounds than closures. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to visual census results, cumulative number of species in catch surveys was higher in open access than closures sites. This may result from fishers covering more area and habitat or a reduction in the catch of competitively subordinate and rare species by aggressive, early-caught fish that can dominate bait. Comparisons of ecological visual census surveys and fisheries-dependent methods indicated that small differences in catch composition can reflect larger ecological differences and that baiting methods can underestimate biodiversity. Ecological impacts of fishing and large-scale changes in marine ecosystems must be considerable given the many fisheries-dependent assessments report modest changes.

AB We investigated the diversity of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes occurring on the abdominal setal tufts and in the emptied midgut of the marine mudshrimp Pestarella tyrrhena (Decapoda: Thalassinidea). There were no dominant phylotypes on the setal tufts. The majority of the phylotypes belonged to the phylum Bacteroidetes, frequently occurring in the water column. The rest of the phylotypes were related to anoxygenic photosynthetic alpha-Proteobacteria and to Actinobacteria. This bacterial profile seems more of a marine assemblage rather than a specific one suggesting that no specific microbial process can be inferred on the setal tufts. In the emptied midgut, 64 clones were attributed to 16 unique phylotypes with the majority (40.6%) belonging to the gamma-Proteobacteria, specifically to the genus Vibrio, a marine group with known symbionts of decapods. The next most abundant group was the E >-Proteobacteria (28.1%), with members as likely symbionts related to the processes involving redox reactions occurring in the midgut. In addition, phylotypes related to the Spirochaetes (10.9%) were also present, with relatives capable of symbiosis conducting a nitrite associated metabolism. Entomoplasmatales, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria related phylotypes were also found. These results indicate a specific bacterial community dominated by putative symbiotic Bacteria within the P. tyrrhena's midgut.

AB In birds, the chick's physical state at nest departure is critical for survival, especially for seabirds that shift from a terrestrial to a marine life. The timing of this life history transition should therefore be finely tuned by proximate factors reflecting the relative influence of parents and chicks. Using king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, as a model, we investigated how food provisioning and chick developmental status and/or body condition interact with chick fledging behaviour to optimize the physical state at colony departure. During the month preceding colony departure, movements, developmental status and body condition were compared between naturally and experimentally fed chicks. Parents stopped feeding their moulting, obese chick on average 16 days before colony departure and no offspring anorexia was observed. All chicks left their feeding site at the time of moult end, indicating that complete feather development is a prerequisite for departing. The time between moult end and colony departure reduced both intra- and intergroup variation in body condition at departure, suggesting that this condition was optimized in terms of a trade-off between fat stores and buoyancy. After moult end, chicks increased their locomotor activity and energy expenditure, which contributes to the regulation of body condition. Our results indicate that the cessation of parental feeding does not trigger colony departure. Rather, the timing of departure depends on the chick's physical state, regardless of its recent feeding history. Thus, in king penguins, the parental decision to desert the chick seems to reflect a compromise between the offspring's body condition and its developmental status.

AB We used a growth chamber experiment with first-year garlic mustard plants to explore the effects of three garlic mustard removal techniques (treatment with glyphosate, pulling out the entire plant, and clipping the shoot) on growth of the native herb pale jewelweed and its associated mycorrhizal fungi. We also explored the effects of activated carbon and mycorrhizal inocula amendments. We monitored plant height, intra- and extraradical mycorrhizal structures, root growth, and the fractal dimension of the root system. Removing as much garlic mustard root tissue as possible by hand pulling plants led to larger jewelweed plants than other removal methods. Activated carbon and mycorrhizal inocula did not improve plant growth.

AB The relative abundance and size of prey fish in the stomachs of the predator Acestrorhynchus pantaneiro were compared with those recorded in the field to estimate prey selection. Fish samples were taken monthly in the Manso Reservoir (State of Mato Grosso, Brazil) immediately after the impoundment, from March 2000 to February 2001 (period I) and from March 2003 to February 2004 (period II). In period I, the small relative dominance of the prey in the environment seemed to have lead to random foraging. In period II, however, when the forage fish Moenkhausia dichroura was dominant in the environment, the predator shifted its diet, foraging mainly on this prey. Species with short relative body depth were positively selected. The prey size classes between 30 and 49 mm, and 50 and 69 mm standard length (L-S) were the most abundant in the environment. Small prey were predominantly selected by A. pantaneiro. Even when a given prey or prey size was predominant in the environment, A. pantaneiro was a selective predator and maintained its preferences associated to prey type and L-S, although it consumed the most abundant resource.

ID COMMUNITY
AB Despite rapid socio-economic development in Kalahari drylands, contemporary research suggests that biodiversity remains important as a component of the complex portfolio of livelihood strategies, as a real and perceived safety net in times of stress, and a key factor of cultural identity. The degree to which the spatially and temporally dynamic nature of biodiversity in drylands influences livelihoods is, however, little studied, particularly in socially complex contemporary rural settlements. Greater understanding in this area is required to allow better-informed design and implementation of rural development, poverty alleviation and conservation initiatives. This is particularly true in the light of predicted increases in environmental dynamism with climate change. An interdisciplinary approach was used in two environmentally and socially distinct dryland settlements in Botswana, to investigate the extent to which the dynamic biodiverse setting influences contemporary rural livelihoods. Results illustrate that biodiversity, particularly its dynamics, is of critical contemporary importance to rural settlement livelihoods, particularly in times of inner settlement scarcity. Entitlements to biodiversity dynamics were, however, bound up by complex settlement-specific social, economic and political factors. Unless such contextual within-settlement dynamics are understood, the relative importance of biodiversity in rural development and poverty alleviation strategies in contemporary Kalahari drylands may be undermined.

AB In a previous study, Exiguobacterium mexicanum strain 8N (DSM 16483(T)) and Microbacterium sp. strain 8L (DSM 16485) in gnotobiotic cultures of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana indicated beneficial effects on the development of Artemia larvae. In this study, Artemia larvae with and without autoclaved yeast as food, were challenged with strains 8N and 8L under monoxenic condition to determine ingestion, location and viability of bacterial cells in Artemia gut lumen. The results of light and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the bacterial cells of both strains were ingested by Artemia metanauplii. Furthermore, both strains were detected by fluorescence microscopy as live or dead cells along the Artemia gut lumen. However, the band profile in denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis of the 16S rDNA sequence, retrieved from Artemia gut lumen exposed to both bacteria in monoxenic and dixenic conditions, showed only a band corresponding to strain 8N, suggesting that a differential bacterial ingestion or a differential generation of PCR products occurred. In all Artemia experiments, the cells of the strains 8N and 8L were confined within the chyme in the space limited by the perithrophic membrane. No evidence was found that the bacteria adhered or colonized the intestinal epithelium.

AB Interference competition for limited habitat or refuges is known to produce density-dependent mortality and generate patterns of micro-habitat distribution. While in mobile species the outcome of interference at a local scale can usually be determined from differences in body size and behavior, the population-level consequences of such interactions vary depending on rates of settlement and recruitment at a site, which are not directly correlated to local reproductive success. Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving microhabitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and Acanthocyclus hassleri, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds and excluding A. gayi to rock crevices. Between April 2001 and March 2006 we quantified monthly recruitment rates in artificial collectors at 17 sites over 900 km of the central coast of Chile. Results show that recruitment rates of A. hassleri are almost two orders of magnitude lower than those of A. gayi, and that they are tightly and positively correlated among sites across the region, suggesting that at scales of kilometers larval stages of these species are affected by similar oceanographic processes. Total crab densities per site were also positively correlated between species and strongly associated to mussel cover, with overall low crab densities at all sites where mussel cover was lower than about 60%. At all sites with mussel cover > 60%, the ratio of A. gayi to A. hassleri density progressively decreased from recruits (2.6) to juveniles (0.5) to adults (0.04), overcoming initial differences in recruitment rates. The relative success of the inferior competitor at sites with low mussel cover does not appear to provide a potential mechanism favoring regional coexistence through dispersal to other sites ("mass effects"), because their densities were lower than at sites of high mussel cover. Yet, at many sites of low mussel cover the dominant competitor is virtually absent, allowing A. gayi to attain larger population sizes at the scale of the region. Thus, the factors limiting the dominant competitor from successfully utilizing other microhabitats seem to be the most critical factor in promoting both local and regional coexistence between these species.

AB Aim In order to investigate the occurrence of wetland woods in the latitudinal transition to arid regions in south-western Europe, we studied species patterns (richness and abundance), examined floristic differences between woods along the latitudinal gradient, and determined the relative influence of the underlying environmental drivers of plant variation at various scales.
   Location The Atlantic coastal belt of the Iberian Peninsula along the entire latitudinal gradient (44-38 degrees N).
   Methods Large-scale surveys were carried out in search of woods located in flats or depressions with prolonged waterlogging. Stands were selected for study when they displayed a continuous tree structure and little sign of human disturbance. Sampling included plant inventories in 114 plots, in which presence and abundance cover were recorded for all vascular and bryophyte species. Both diversity and composition were used to investigate plant species patterns. Gamma and alpha diversity (species richness) values were used to compare Ibero-Atlantic wetland woods with other European woods. Species richness was modelled as a function of environmental variation at regional and finer scales (landscape and local scale), using linear mixed-effects models and model selection based on the Akaike information criterion. Hierarchical clustering and ordination using perennial species were used to detect floristic differences between sites. Partial canonical correspondence analyses were performed to determine the relative importance of each set of environmental drivers in structuring the vegetation trends at regional and finer scales.
   Results A significant proportion of wetland woods occurred in the transition to the Mediterranean region. Ibero-Atlantic wetland woods displayed low gamma and alpha diversity compared with other woods. Species richness was strongly influenced by finer-scale variables, in particular distance to rivers, whereas regional variables were less influential. Based on tree dominance, the classification revealed five vegetation types, but the majority of stands (86%) were included in woods dominated by Salix atrocinerea Brot. and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner. Species abundances were correlated with both regional and finer-scale hydrological variables, which explained 37.5% of the variation, 11.9% of which corresponded to regional arid 18.5% to finer-scale environmental descriptors.
   Main conclusions True wetland woods persist in the transition to arid regions of south-western Europe. The latitudinal gradient influences the spatial variation of species, but local hydrological variables were found to play a significant role in both diversity and compositional patterns.

AB 1. Visitation rate is a measure of the frequency with which animals visit specific locations of interest. This information is crucial for various problems in the conservation and management of animal species, e.g. to determine the risk wildlife poses to human managed resources or the predation risks of nests. An important assessment tool, especially for cryptic animals, is to count indirect signs of presence, such as tracks or faeces.
   2. Here we propose a maximum likelihood-based method that uses information on the age of tracks or signs, and we show that existing visitation rate/probability estimators are special cases of this more general approach.
   3. Using simulated data, we compared the performance of the new visitation rate estimator to three other estimators, including the most commonly used estimator. These estimators make use of either fresh, aged or total signs, whereas our approach uses information simultaneously on both fresh and aged signs. The new estimator is, on average, in excess of three times more accurate than the next best estimator. Moreover, the new approach is very flexible and can be applied for sampling regimens with irregular time intervals between sampling.
   4. We demonstrate the application of the method to field data by estimating the visitation rate of Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) to a commercial fish pond. To facilitate the use of this method, we provide an easy-to-use Excel workbook and give recommendations on the most efficient sampling regimens.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Visitation rate is an important quantity that can be estimated by repetitive sampling of indirect signs. We demonstrate the advantage of incorporating information explicitly on the age of signs over existing approaches. The new estimator can be applied to any species for which it is possible to discriminate between aged and new signs or tracks, and should be widely applicable in ecology and conservation biology.

AB Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus mugo Turra originating from two plantations established during the 1960s are invading subalpine heathlands higher than 1500 in above sea level in Montseny Natural Park (northeast Spain). Both species are native at a regional scale but may not have been present in the park's subalpine vegetation previously. In addition, Abies alba P. Mill., which is in regression in many areas in Europe, is also colonizing the area from a neighboring natural forest. This invasion appears to be stimulated by a combination of natural and human factors, including differences between vegetation components, climate (i.e., drought periods), changes in land use due to conservation policies (i.e., suppressing fire or grazing practices), the creation of the plantations, and probably the nurse role played by accompanying dwarf shrubs (Calluna vulgaris [L.] Hull and juniperus communis subsp. nana [Willd.] Syme). We examined the effects of this process in terms of the spatial dispersion and characteristics of the established conifers and deduce implications for the conservation of isolated subalpine pastures in Mediterranean Basin mountains. P. sylvestris was the most successful invading species in this area. The P. mugo invasion is distributed mainly near the plantation. The only native conifer species, A. alba, appears to be colonizing only the eastern slope. The invasion process is related to the diversity and species richness recorded on each slope. Conserving valuable subalpine heathlands at the latitude of the Montseny mountain range implies Suppressing propagule pressures from the plantations. The option of removing conifers that are normative, at a local scale, must be considered. However, in the case of the native A. alba this option leads to a management conflict between conserving former pastureland and the dispersion of A. alba.

AB Characterization of the particle population for a location in a water supply reservoir, Kensico Reservoir, N.Y, is documented for a high turbidity event, from its onset, through alum treatment and its waning. Supporting in situ measurements included the beam attenuation coefficient at 670 nm (C-670) and 660 nm (C-660) [surrogates of turbidity (T-n)], particle concentrations (N) and size distributions (PSDs), and size class specific settling velocities (SVs). Laboratory measurements included chemical and morphometric analyses of individual particles, and routine measurements of T,,. The turbidity is shown to be primarily derived from clay minerals, mostly in the size range of 1.5-6 mu m. An initial high C-670 level (40 m(-1); T-n similar to 100 NTU) decreased sevenfold in less than 1 week in response to alum treatment that largely eliminated the particle size classes responsible for the elevated turbidity. Successful SV experiments, made using a laser in situ scattering and transmissometry (LISST) instrument, for seven particle size classes in the range of 1.25-129 mu m yielded SV values of 0.17-69.4 m day(-1). Size classes larger than similar to 5 mu m settled much slower than Stokes law predictions, before alum treatment, indicating that these classes existed as porous floes or aggregates. Decreases in SVs following treatment suggest changes in floc character consistent with increased porosity. In situ measurements of C-670, N, PSDs, and SVs can contribute to the development and testing of a multiple particle size class model to simulate fate, transport, and impacts of suspended particles.

AB An assessment of biome-specificity in southern African insect assemblages was undertaken using sweep collections in fynbos, grassland, subtropical thicket and Nama-karoo. Insect samples from the same biome generally cluster together in multidimensional scaling analyses, although there is a great variability between sites within each biome. Rich and distinctive insect faunas exist in each biome, including fynbos. In the Baviaanskloof Conservation Area of the southeastern Cape, where the four biomes marginally co-occur, some insect assemblages are enriched relative to sites at the core of the biomes, presumably through the mixing of faunas via transient or persistent establishment of populations recruited from adjacent biomes.

   ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS
AB Radiata pine ( Pinus radiata D. Don) plantations are often found in close proximity to vegetation set aside for biodiversity conservation. We examined the intrusive effects of radiata pine beyond the confines of plantations by quantifying the penetration of pine litter ( needles, cones, twigs and seeds) and wildings from plantations into adjacent eucalypt woodland in the Jenolan Caves Karst Conservation Reserve ( south- eastern Australia). We then investigated the relationship between pine- litter intrusion and plant- community structure in adjacent woodland vegetation. We found significantly higher quantities of pine litter and wildings at all sites adjacent to plantations than at reference woodland sites that were not adjacent to plantations. At adjacent sites, pine litter decreased significantly with increasing distance from plantations. Alarmingly, native plant species richness declined and exotic plant species richness increased with increasing quantities of pine litter. Thus, there were fewer native plant species and more exotics in areas bordering pine plantations. Our findings suggest a potentially important link between the intrusion of pine litter and a loss of native biodiversity and facilitation of exotic- species invasion. We suggest the provision of a buffer zone around plantations in order to minimise intrusive impacts of plantations on native biodiversity.

AB This study reports on the spatial and temporal patterns of seedling establishment in the Turkwel riverine forest, Kenya. Seedlings of the dominant tree species Acacia tortilis and Hyphaene compressa were mapped and monitored to assess the underlying causes of seedling recruitment and mortality. The broad-scale distribution of A. tortilis was not correlated with any environmental variables, while H. compressa seedlings were confined to flood-exposed sites in the arid downstream section of the floodplain. One year of monitoring showed that seedling recruitment of A. tortilis was evoked by prolonged rainfall, while seedling mortality was caused by desiccation, browsing and trampling. In contrast, seedling recruitment and mortality of H. compressa was largely unaffected by rainfall and livestock, probably due to the high moisture requirements of seeds and the tolerance of seedlings to disturbance. There were no effects of soils, light, or seedling density on the establishment of A. tortilis and H. compressa seedlings. This study demonstrates the importance of parallel mapping and monitoring of riverine seedlings in order to understand patterns and processes of forest regeneration in arid and semi-arid floodplains.

AB To contribute to a better forest management of Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg., Tabebuia donnell-smithii Rose and Cordia elaeagnoides D.C. in Colima, their seasonal diameter growth was determined, as well as its relationship with the occurrence of phenological events in the trees along with the temperature and precipitation of the region. Dendrometer bands were installed on 37 trees (10 B. simaruba, 13 T donnell-smithii and 14 C elaeagnoides), to be read every two months, during 13 months (August 2002-August 2003), along with measurements using diameter tape. The results showed differences among species and measurement dates (p <= 0.001) for the diameter growth registered with bands, as well as among species and diameter categories (p < 0.001), and among measurement dates (p <= 0.01) for the growth registered with tape. Although the bands were more precise than the tape. a monthly/bimonthly measurement frequency is suggested in periods of one to three years when bands are used, and a semestral/annual frequency in periods of three years or more when tape is used. T donnell-smithii presented the highest average annual growth with 0.72 (bands) and 1.85 (tape) cm year(-1), followed by B. simaruba, with 0.25 (bands) and 0.69 (tape) cm year(-1), and C elaeagnoides with 0.17 (bands) and 0.56 (tape) cm year(-1). In C elaeagnoides, the growth registered with diameter tape showed significant correlations with temperature (r = 0.79, p <= 0.05) and precipitation (r = 0.76, p <= 0.05), while that obtained with dendrometer bands only had a significant correlation with temperature (r = 0.77, p <= 0.05).

AB Nymphs of Perillus bioculatus F., a specialist pentatomid predator of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), are smaller than comparable instars of their prey. In laboratory experiments, P. bioculatus fed small prey exhibited greater capture success, increased survivorship, and faster development to adulthood than individuals fed large prey. An increase of potato beetle prey stage by one instar lowered capture success and survival by 82 and 80%, respectively. Although multiple P. bioculatus are commonly found feeding on a single prey in the field, laboratory survival rates, and development times did not differ significantly between Perillus bioculatus reared individually and in groups. P. bioculatus presented with two prey sizes most commonly attacked the instar that was easiest to capture and that maximized survival. In the absence of augmentative release programs, P. bioculatus is unable to regulate L. decemlineata populations. At the study site in Yakima, Washington, L. decemlineata completes one to three generations per year in potato fields, never reaching stable age distribution before the end of the growing season. Consequently, small, easily captured prey are present only episodically. Developing P. bioculatus must therefore feed on large prey during much of the growing season, limiting their capacity to grow and survive, which is hypothesized as one reason for their failure to regulate L. decemlineata populations. Typically, invulnerable prey stages stabilize predator-prey dynamics. The evidence presented here suggests that prey refuges can also destabilize predator-prey interactions by limiting the capacity of predators to numerically respond and to regulate prey populations.

DE dynamic automata; spatial patterns; rangeland
AB The spatial grazing pattern of goats around a water point on an arid and semi-arid rangeland system in the Karoo in South Africa was modeled. A dynamic automata model was developed by subdividing a spatial area into subunits called cells and where the dynamics of each cell depends on its present state, the state of its neighbors and external factors such as rainfall. By using a dynamic automata model, the long-term influences on the changes in vegetation composition of two species, namely woody perennials and galenia africana, are investigated.
   The model relates a preference equation, which is a combination of two parameters, forage density and distance to a water point, to the total amount of time spent by each animal within a particular cell in a year. The model provides evidence that the total number of animals grazing an area, the number of water points in the system and the weighting factors associated with the preference equation, influence the extent of degradation of the area.

AB Aquatic invertebrates are exposed to bacteria in a variety of manners; in this study, colonization of invertebrates by three species of bacteria was examined. Rifampicin resistant strains of a common stream bacterium, Burkholderia cepacia, the coliform bacterium, Escherichia coli, and an insecticidal bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, were introduced into microcosms where they were given the opportunity to colonize aquatic invertebrates of several species. After incubation, the numbers of bacteria on the exterior surfaces of the invertebrates and in their digestive tract and feces were determined. In addition, two insect species were exposed to the bacteria as juveniles and then reared to adulthood. Overall, most bacterial species were able to effectively colonize the exterior surfaces of the invertebrates. In contrast, the foregut was not well colonized in ah species of invertebrates (the bivalve Corbicula was particularly low) and the numbers in the hindgut were lower than in the foregut. Feces were colonized to varying degrees. The colonized invertebrates were able to function as vectors of the introduced bacteria, in that, they were able to disseminate the bacteria into new habitats. In general, there were few significant differences among invertebrate or bacterial species. The adult insects that had been provided introduced bacteria as larvae, typically retained these bacteria in their digestive tract; however, E, coli was not found in the gut of either species. Tn conclusion, almost all invertebrates were colonized by the different species of bacteria and even those bacteria which are not "native" or common in streams (E. coli and B. thuringiensis) were able to use the invertebrates as a habitat.

AB The reproductive cycle of the abundant intertidal limpet Cellana ornata (Dillwyn 1817) was examined over 19 months, covering two breeding periods, on a rocky intertidal platform in southern New Zealand. A gonad index was calculated, and histological sections were used to count the numbers of mature and immature eggs present. Fecundity was estimated using counts of eggs before and after spawning. To determine any variation between sites, the gonad index of limpets at a second site dominated by boulders was examined over 6 months during the second breeding period. C. ornata had a single spawning period annually during summer, with greatest gonad sizes in January-February. There were significant differences in peak gonad indices between two breeding seasons on the platform. Within the second breeding period, both the timing and magnitude of peak gonad development differed between sites, with lower reproductive output at the boulder site. Fecundity increased with increasing size, but individuals are probably capable of reproducing after their first year on the shore. The life history of this species is discussed in comparison to other limpets in New Zealand.

AB Changes in zooplankton diversity and density in response to reservoir aging in Pawnee Reservoir were investigated. Zooplankton samples collected from April 1992 through April 1993, were compared to a similar study conducted after initial impoundment by Helzer (1971), in 1968-1970. Since this initial study, increases in turbidity and resulting changes in biotic interactions significantly altered the zooplankton community. A significant increase in total zooplankton density and a decrease in species richness were observed between study periods. Density increased from 24.6 to 95.4 individuals L(-1), while the number of taxa declined from fourteen to ten. During this time period, Cyclops vernalis became the dominant zooplankter in the reservoir. The density of this predatory copepod increased significantly, from less than or equal to 0.1 l(-1) in 1968-1970, to 44.3 l(-1) in 1992-1993, which accounted for most of the increase in total zooplankton density. Though a greater spring maximum of another dominant, Bosmina spp. was found during the 1992-1993 study period, the annual density of this cladoceran was not significantly different between study periods. Similar trends for Daphnia ambigua and D. parvula were also observed, as greater spring maxima levels were attained, however overall annual densities were not significantly different. The dominance of C. vernalis (46% of annual density) and Bosmina spp. (33%), indicate that these two zooplankters were tolerant of changes in physical conditions resulting from reservoir aging and biotic interactions that followed in the reservoir during the 22 years between study periods.

Researches dealing with this particular aspect of microbiology in the invertebrates have shown the complexity of these associations with components of gut microbiota either ingested transients or residents (Harris, 1993). Few in situ observations concerning microbes in the gut of earthworms have been published. However Jolly et al. (1993) reported the existence of bacteria associated with the gut wall of Lumbricus terrestris.
   Microflora of the alimentary canal of Eisenia fetida andrei fed or on starvation for eight days, was examined in order to study microbial populations and morphotypes in the different regions of the intestine (crop, gizzard, foregut, midgut and hindgut). Those samples were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde, passed through dehydratation series of ethanol, dried with hexamethyldisilazane (Nation, 1983) and then mounted for scanning electron microscopy.
   Cyst forms of ciliates were shown in the crop-gizzard region. As far as we are aware it had not been reported before in the Litterature. Their presence allows us, with reasonable certainty, to assert the part they play in the transmission per os of infeoffed ciliates.
   Thecamoebians recognizable by their test consisting in imbricated scales were observed in the foregut of fed animals.
   Three morphological types of microorganism were observed, i.e. cocci, rod-shaped bacteria and filamentous organisms. The latest were particularly developped in the hindgut and probably attached to the epithelium. This morphotype could not be cultivated on agar medium. Those filamentous bacteria are morphologically similar to those observed in the ileum of rats and mice and in the gut of Lumbricus terrestris by other authors. They are considered as autochtonous gut microflora.
   In fed animals the alimentary diet had a masking affect of the surface of the gut wall; the attachment of bacteria on fragments of the alimentary bolus was clearly observed.
   A thick layer of mucus covered the gut wall of eight days starved animals, allowing bacteria and plant fragments to lay down. This observation shows that gut transit of some elements may be far longer than expected.

AB A feeding experiment was used to study how an antlion would respond when prey captures cease abruptly. A significant interaction was found between two fixed factors, capture frequency and capture intensity. At each capture intensity, antlions fed at high frequencies relocated their pits sooner than antilions fed at medium and low frequencies. In a comparison between treatments where the long-term rate of gain was constant, antlions experiencing medium frequencies and low intensities gave up in less time than antlions experiencing medium intensities and low frequencies. In another comparison between treatments, antlions fed at high frequency but low intensity, left their pits within a shorter period of time than antlions fed at high intensity but low frequency. A significant second order polynomial regression showed that the time taken by an antlion to leave a pit, after feeding had stopped, decreased as the long-term rate of gain increased. However more importantly, the giving-up time was found to increase significantly as the capture frequency increased. The difference between minimum expected giving-up time and observed giving-up time increased with an increase in inter-capture interval.

AB Sandy pitfall traps of antlions are elaborate constructions to capture prey. Antlions exploit the interactions between the particles in their habitat and build a stable trap. This trap is close to the unstable state; prey items will slide towards the centre-where the antlion ambushes-when entering the trap. This is efficient but requires permanent maintenance. According to the present knowledge, antlions throw sand, mainly to cause sandslides towards the centre of the pit. We hypothesized that: (i) sand-throwing causes sandslides towards the centre of the pit and (ii) sand-throwing constantly maintains the pitfall trap and thus keeps its efficiency high. Using laboratory experiments, as well as finite-element analysis, we tested these hypotheses. We show, experimentally and numerically, that sand that accumulates at the centre of the pit will be removed continuously by sand-throwing, this maintenance is leading to slope condition close to an unstable state. This keeps the slope angle steep and the efficiency of the trap constant. Furthermore, the resulting sandslides can relocate the trapped prey towards the centre of the pit. This study adds further insights from specific mechanical properties of a granular medium into the behavioural context of hunting antlion larvae.

DE coexistence theory; competition; mycorrhizal interactions; pollination

ID MAINTENANCE
AB Mutualisms are ubiquitous in nature and are thought to play important roles in the maintenance of biodiversity. For biodiversity to be maintained, however, species must coexist in the face of competitive exclusion. Chesson's coexistence theory provides a mechanistic framework for evaluating coexistence, yet mutualisms are conspicuously absent from coexistence theory and there are no comparable frameworks for evaluating how mutualisms affect the coexistence of competiting species. To address this conceptual gap, I develop theory predicting how multitrophic mutualisms mediate the coexistence of species competing for mutualistic commodities and other limiting resources using the niche and fitness difference concepts of coexistence theory. I demonstrate that failing to account for mutualisms can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, species might appear to coexist on resources alone, when the simultaneous incorporation of mutualisms actually drives competitive exclusion, or competitive exclusion might occur under resource competition, when in fact, the incorporation of mutualisms generates coexistence. Existing coexistence theory cannot therefore be applied to mutualisms without explicitly considering the underlying biology of the interactions. By discussing how the metrics derived from coexistence theory can be quantified empirically, I show how this theory can be operationalized to evaluate the coexistence consequences of mutualism in natural communities.

TI Drought, fire and grazing precursors to large-scale pine forest decline
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE fire regime change; forest dynamics; functional traits analysis;
   palaeoecology; phase plots; tipping point
AB Aim Temperate forests are currently facing multiple stresses due to climate change, biological invasions, habitat fragmentation and fire regime change. How these stressors interact with each other influences how, when and whether ecosystems recover, or whether they adapt or transition to a different ecological state. Because forest recovery or collapse may take longer than a human lifetime, predicting the outcomes of different stressor combinations remains difficult. A clearer vision of future forest trajectories in a changing world may be gained by examining collapses of forests in the past. Here, we use long-term ecological data to conduct a post-mortem examination of the decline of maritime pine forests (Pinus pinaster Ait.) on the SW Iberian Peninsula 7000-6500 years ago.
   Location Portugal and Spain.
   Methods We compared four palaeoecological records-two with pine declines and two without-using a multiproxy approach. Bioclimatic differences between the four sites were explored. Proxies for past vegetation and disturbance (fire and grazing) were compared with independent palaeoclimatic records. We performed functional traits analysis and used phase plots to examine the causes of pine decline.
   Results The pine decline represents a critical transition in SW Iberia, which lies close to maritime pine's bioclimatic limits. Prolonged drought likely killed trees and suppressed the fires that normally stimulate pine germination and pinewood recovery. Increased grazing pressure facilitated the rapid spread of resprouter shrubs. These competed with pine trees and ultimately replaced them. Our data highlight complex interactions between climate, fire, grazing and forest resilience.
   Main Conclusions The pine decline occurred at least a century after post-fire resprouters overtook obligate seeders in the vegetation, constituting an early-warning signal of forest loss. Fire suppression, resprouter encroachment and grazing may threaten the persistence of Mediterranean forests as droughts become more frequent and extreme.

AB Communal livestock grazing is expected to impact botanical composition and plant diversity of Drakensberg montane grasslands. Accordingly, a grazing gradient extending outward from kraals, and fence-line contrasts between communal rangeland and protected areas (Golden Gate Highlands National Park and Royal Natal National Park), were studied in the QwaQwa region of South Africa. Presence of a grazing gradient was confirmed by a decrease in the amount of cattle dung with increasing distance from kraals that was independent of altitude, solar radiation, slope, or soil physico-chemical properties. Canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that grazing intensity had a significant influence on botanical composition although most compositional variation was unexplained. Higher grazing intensities tended to negatively affect plant species richness and diversity, and the cover of perennial graminoids, but benefitted the abundance of dwarf shrubs and alien invasive species. Similar effects were apparent across each of the fence line contrasts. Despite a long history of livestock grazing, communal rangeland supported >320 indigenous species, illustrating some contribution to biodiversity conservation, but being compromised near kraals. An improved approach for study of the impacts of livestock grazing on plant diversity is suggested that would overcome the difficulties of assessing rare and threatened species using a community approach.

AB Creating ?resilient places? has increasingly become a major priority for urban planners, designers, and policy makers. ?Spatial resilience? as a subset of urban resilience can be used to guide the development of a conceptual framework for resilient place assessment. In this regard, a resilient place should feature a combination of physical and non-physical characteristics that can contribute to improved response and adaptation to a broad range of natural and manmade hazards. In this context, resilience is claimed to be the ability to manage, mitigate and adapt to varied risks and changes that threaten the quality of the functionality, livability, and vitality of a place. To further elaborate on the concept of resilient place, in this study, 127 articles were reviewed using qualitative methods, and general urban resilience definitions related to semantic resilience dimensions were extracted. These are, namely, intrinsic, resilience behavior, and reinforcing attributes. Eventually, 22 studies were selected for content analysis using a qualitative review. The conceptual framework of place assessment was developed concerning the constituent attributes of ?place? and ?spatial resilience.? In the proposed framework, the constructive dimensions of Resilient Place Assessment (RPA) include four dimensions, three of which are semantic resilience dimensions. These dimensions include the intrinsic resilience attributes (i.e., robustness, coherence, efficiency, foresight capacity, flexibility, resourcefulness, knowledge and learning, and self-organization), behavioral resilience attributes (i.e., recovery; adaption; innovation; transformation), reinforcing resilience attributes (i.e., diversity, redundancy, modularity, and connectivity), and place-making components (i.e., form and structure, environment and behavior, and image and meaning). Insights provided in this conceptual framework can be used by urban planners, designers, and policy makers in their efforts towards creating more resilient places.

TI Using the 2020 global pandemic as a springboard to highlight the need
   for amphibian conservation in eastern Asia

AB Emerging infectious diseases are on the rise in many different taxa, including, among others, the amphibian batrachochytrids, the snake fungal disease and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) virus, responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mammals. Following the onset of the pandemic linked to COVID-19, eastern Asia has shown strong leadership, taking actions to regulate the trade of potential vector species in several regions. These actions were taken in response to an increase in public awareness, and the need for a quick reaction to mitigate against further pandemics. However, trade restrictions rarely affect amphibians, despite the risk of pathogen transmission, directly, or indirectly through habitat destruction and the loss of vector consumption. Thus, species that help alleviate the risk of zoonoses or provide biological control are not protected. Hence, in view of the global amphibian decline and the risk of zoonoses, we support the current wildlife trade regulations and support measures to safeguard wildlife from overexploitation. The current period of regulation overhaul should be used as a springboard for amphibian conservation. To mitigate risks, we suggest the following stipulations specifically for amphibians. I) Restrictions to amphibian farming in eastern Asia, in relation to pathogen transmission and the establishment of invasive species. II) Regulation of the amphibian pet trade, with a focus on potential vector species. III) Expansion of the wildlife trade ban, to limit the wildlife-human-pet interface. The resulting actions will benefit both human and wildlife populations, as they will lead to a decrease in the risk of zoonoses and better protection of the environment. Significance statement: There is an increasing number of emerging infectious diseases impacting all species, including amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The latest threat to humans is the virus responsible for COVID-19, and the resulting pandemic. Countries in eastern Asia have taken steps to regulate wildlife trade and prevent further zoonoses thereby decreasing the risk of pathogens arising from wild species. However, as amphibians are generally excluded from regulations we support specific trade restrictions: I) Restrictions to amphibian farming; II) regulation of the amphibian pet trade; III) expansion of the wildlife trade ban. These restrictions will benefit both human and wildlife populations by decreasing the risks of zoonoses and better protecting the environment.

   resilience
AB Human occupation of and alteration of the world's coast has transformed large stretches of it into Coupled Human-Natural Systems (CHANS) in which humans both influence and are influenced by coastal evolution. In such systems, human activity is as critical on natural resilience as processes and sediment supply derived from the natural setting. Pre- and post-storm observations of these interactions on the intensively developed Atlantic coast of the Gulf of Cadiz, (Spain and Portugal) are examined to determine natural and engineering resilience. Three case studies are used in three CHANS, showing that human interventions interact in complex ways with the natural system influencing post-storm recovery. In natural coasts, storm impact is assessed in terms of geomorphological response; on developed coasts, it is quantified as damage to infrastructure or loss of amenity. Preparedness, availability of resources, choice of response and the speed at which human agencies respond affect resilience for post-storm beach behaviour. Results show in some sites natural resilience adjusting by post-storm sediment transfers and an equilibrium morphology that may differ from pre-storm morphology; engineering resilience ensured that CHANS regained their pre-storm human infrastructure and amenity. Their management requires a fundamentally different approach to that of natural coastlines. The current immature stage of understanding of CHANS (especially the human preparedness and response components) is illustrated by the case studies presented where short-term political decisions and reactions to storms play a strong role in post-storm response. The nature and extent of many developed coasts as CHANS is slowly becoming more widely acknowledged, but to increase natural resilience and decrease vulnerability in CHANS better planning is required so that future storms are anticipated and when they happen, pre-planned human response actions are activated. Storms are an integral and inevitable element in the behaviour of coastal CHANS, not a disaster or emergency. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Tropical montane grasslands (TMG) support biodiverse and endemic taxa and provide vital ecosystem services to downstream communities. Nevertheless, invasive alien tree species across the world have threatened tropical grasslands and grassland endemic species. In India, TMG in the Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats have been reduced due to exotic tree invasions (Acacias, Pines, and Eucalyptus species). The loss of grassland habitat has, in turn, reduced the range sizes of species endemic to grasslands (plants, birds, amphibians, and mammals), driving some populations to local extinction. Grassland conversion to exotic trees has also impacted ecosystem services in the Western Ghats. Conserving existing grassland and restoring invaded habitat is critical to reverse these losses. This research focused on identifying grassland restoration sites using satellite images with a high spatial resolution (RapidEye). We used an object-oriented Random Forest classification to map the area for grassland restoration. We identified an area of 254 sq. km. as suitable for grassland restoration and an area of 362 sq. km. for grassland conservation and preventing invasion by exotic tree species. For restoration, we recommend careful removal of young and isolated exotic trees at the invasion front and restoring grasslands, instead of removing dense stands of mature exotic trees. Although our limited data indicate that areas with low fire frequency tend to be invaded, and areas invaded by exotic trees tend to burn at higher intensities, we recommend a broader investigation of these patterns to critically examine a potential role for the use of fire in invasive species management. We assume that removing exotic tree species in the identified restoration sites and restoring the grassland will help recover lost habitat and ensure the viability of indigenous and endemic species and increase streamflow.

AB Resource depletion exerts opposing pressures on co-occurring consumers to expand diets while limiting overlap with competitors. Using foraging theory as a framework, we tested the effects of prey availability on diet specialization and overlap among competing Asian predators: dhole, leopard, and tiger. We used scat analysis from a prey-poor site, combined with a quantitative synthesis of 40 other diet studies, to determine biomass of different prey types consumed by each predator. We then assessed diet composition in relation to prey density, and compared diet breadth and overlap between prey-poor and prey-rich sites. In prey rich areas, all three predators specialized on energetically profitable medium and large ungulates (>30 kg), resulting in narrow, overlapping niches. Each predator shifted toward less profitable small-bodied prey (<= 30 kg) as preferred ungulates declined, whereas consumption of preferred ungulates was unrelated to small prey abundance, as predicted by foraging theory. Diet breadths doubled under prey depletion (except leopard), but overlap declined as diets diverged via species-specific traits that facilitated capture of different types of alternative prey. Asia's apex predators adapt similarly to depletion of mutually preferred ungulates by switching to more numerous but less profitable small prey. Yet they can also partition a depleted prey base through intrinsic niche differences, thereby avoiding competitive exclusion. Our findings illuminate the stabilizing properties of adaptive foraging and niche differences in ecological communities, and provide insights into the behavior and resilience of Asia's endangered apex predators in response to prey depletion in the heavily poached forests of this region.

AB Facilitating coexistence between people and wildlife is a major conservation challenge in East Africa. Some conservation models aim to balance the needs of people and wildlife, but the effectiveness of these models is rarely assessed. Using a case-study approach, we assessed the ecological performance of a pastoral area in northern Tanzania (Manyara Ranch) and established a long-term wildlife population monitoring program (carried out intermittently from 2003 to 2008 and regularly from 2011 to 2019) embedded in a distance sampling framework. By comparing density estimates of the road transect-based long-term monitoring to estimates derived from systematically distributed transects, we found that the bias associated with nonrandom placement of transects was nonsignificant. Overall, cattle and sheep and goat reached the greatest densities and several wildlife species occurred at densities similar (zebra, wildebeest, waterbuck, Kirk's dik-dik) or possibly even greater (giraffe, eland, lesser kudu, Grant's gazelle, Thomson's gazelle) than in adjacent national parks in the same ecosystem. Generalized linear mixed models suggested that most wildlife species (8 out of 14) reached greatest densities during the dry season, that wildlife population densities either remained constant or increased over the 17-year period, and that herbivorous livestock species remained constant, while domestic dog population decreased over time. Cross-species correlations did not provide evidence for interference competition between grazing or mixed livestock species and wildlife species but indicate possible negative relationships between domestic dog and warthog populations. Overall, wildlife and livestock populations in Manyara Ranch appear to coexist over the 17-year span. Most likely, this is facilitated by existing connectivity to adjacent protected areas, effective anti-poaching efforts, spatio-temporal grazing restrictions, favorable environmental conditions of the ranch, and spatial heterogeneity of surface water and habitats. This long-term case study illustrates the potential of rangelands to simultaneously support wildlife conservation and human livelihood goals if livestock grazing is restricted in space, time, and numbers.

AB Context Distance to seed source is often used to estimate seed dispersal-a process needed for post-fire tree recovery. However, distance, especially in mountainous terrain, does not capture pattern or scale-dependent effects controlling seed supply and delivery. Measuring seed source pattern (area and arrangement) could provide insights on how these spatial dynamics shape recovery. Objectives We tested metrics and investigated how seed source pattern, tree regeneration traits, scale, and terrain interact to shape post-fire tree recovery. Our research questions were: Does seed source pattern outperform distance when modeling tree species presence and regeneration density? If yes, does seed source pattern have scale-dependent or terrain-dependent effects on regeneration density? Methods We measured seed source pattern at nested spatial extents around 71 plots and related measurements to local post-fire tree recovery. We used generalized linear models to test metrics and visualize scale-dependent and terrain-dependent effects on regeneration density. Results Distance sufficiently modeled presence, but seed source pattern outperformed distance when modeling regeneration density. Relevant spatial extents and relationships were species-dependent. For wind-dispersed species, regeneration was associated with more seed source area and more complex arrangements, but terrain mediated these relationships. For serotinous and resprouting species, regeneration was associated with less seed source area and less complex arrangements, which are consistent with high-severity burn sites that promote recovery. Conclusions Seed source pattern supports spatial resilience and interacts with scale and terrain to shape regeneration density. Accounting for these spatial dynamics could help steward forests facing changing fire regimes.

AB Multiple invaders commonly co-occur in native ecosystems and in some cases have been shown to facilitate each other thus exacerbating impacts on native species, while in other cases one invader may reduce the impact of another due to competition. We therefore aimed at identifying mechanisms driving alien species interactions. We conducted a common garden experiment investigating all pairwise combinations of 20 alien annual plant species in Germany. We first tested whether competition or facilitation occurred more often. Secondly, we determined whether individual traits, hierarchical or absolute trait distances, multivariate trait or phylogenetic distance explained alien plant interactions best. Thirdly, we assessed whether accounting for trait plasticity explains plant performance better than species-level trait averages. While the magnitude of interspecific competition compared to intraspecific competition was on average larger across the 190 alien species combinations, interspecific facilitation still occurred in 24% of cases. Interactions could be better explained by hierarchical trait distances which reflect competitive ability, compared to phylogenetic and multivariate trait distance (reflecting niche differences). This finding supports criticisms about the applicability of testing limiting similarity versus environmental filtering and the community phylogenetic approach. Specifically, when growing taller and having a lower specific leaf area than the co-occurring alien neighbour, biomass and seed number of individuals in mixture increased compared to growing alone. Effects of seed mass, root:shoot ratio and flowering time depended on the performance measure. In contrast to recent suggestions, accounting for trait plasticity did not necessarily explain plant performance better than models using species-level trait averages. These results advance our fundamental understanding of trait-interaction relationships, strengthening recent findings on the importance of competitive hierarchy in shaping interactions and community structure. In particular, applying these concepts to the novel case of alien-alien interactions, is crucial given the continuing accumulation of alien species around the globe.

AB The most prolific acacias in southern Europe (Acacia dealbata, A. melanoxylon and A. longifolia) are rapidly spreading in its westernmost area: Portugal and NW Spain, where congeners with invasion potential are already established. We performed a bibliographic search of acacia invasions in southern Europe and used spatial data on acacia distribution and abiotic parameters in Iberia to check the influence of abiotic factors on acacia invasion. According to our results, in Iberia A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon seem limited by high soil pH (pH(cacl2) > 5.5), frequent frosts (> 21 to 40 d yr(-1)) and low annual precipitation (< 500 to 1000 mm); data were inconclusive for A. longifolia, while A. saligna prefers neutral soils in the driest and warmest areas. The percentage of area occupied by A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon increases significantly with the percentage of burnt surface. In the literature, acacias' invasiveness is usually attributed to their high resprouting and seeding capacity and to native exclusion through their allelopathic potential; symbiotic promiscuity with rhizobia; high environmental plasticity; and adaptation to burnt, cleared and resource-poor land. However, it is unknown how acacias became so invasive in western Iberia, where native Fabaceae shrubs with similar ecological traits (and invaders outside their natural range) are abundant. Invasive acacias can modify fire and water regimes, above-ground biodiversity, and topsoil characteristics (microbial communities, pH, organic matter and macronutrients levels); nevertheless, sound comparisons with mature stands of Iberian legumes for these and other soil properties (N fluxes, micronutrients) are lacking. As several acacias outcompete Iberian Fabaceae shrubs partly thanks to enemy release, the introduction of biocontrol agents (as for A. longifolia in Portugal) can be useful for invasion control.

AB Bivalves have ecological and economic importance but information regarding their associated microbiomes is lacking. As suspension feeders, bivalves capture and ingest a myriad of particles, and their digestive organs have a high throughput of particle-associated microbiota. To better understand the complement of transient and resident microbial communities, standard methods need to be developed. For example, fecal sampling could represent a convenient proxy for the gut microbiome and is simple, nondestructive, and allows for sampling of individuals through time. The goal of this study was to evaluate fecal sampling as a reliable proxy for gut microbiome assessment in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). Mussels were collected from the natural environment and placed into individual sterilized microcosms for 6 h to allow for fecal egestion. Feces and gut homogenates from the same individuals were sampled and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Fecal communities of different mussels resembled each other but did not resemble gut communities. Fecal communities were significantly more diverse, in terms of amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and evenness, than gut communities. Results suggested a mostly transient nature for fecal microbiota. Nonetheless, mussels retained a distinct resident microbial community in their gut after fecal egestion that was dominated by ASVs belonging toMycoplasma. The use of fecal sampling as a nondestructive substitute for direct sampling of the gut is strongly discouraged. Experiments that aim to study solely resident bivalve gut microbiota should employ an egestion period prior to gut sampling to allow time for voidance of transient microbes.

AB Competition in the already highly competitive automotive industry intensified in the early 1990's. The ubiquitous internal combustion engine began to be challenged by the upstart alternatives of battery and hybrid electric vehicles, which has led to an intricate web of knowledge development. Our research aims to qualify and quantify the dynamic relationships that formed in the knowledge development of powertrains by adopting conceptual insights from evolutionary ecology. Specifically, the interdependent relationships observed in the Technological Innovation System (TIS) framework is similar to that between species such that powertrain systems can either support or inhibit the knowledge growth of one another over time. Our theoretical framework extends the economics of technical change within technologies vis-a-vis the concept of 'positive and negative externalities' and 'knowledge development co-dynamics'. We use patents data extracted from Thomson Reuters' Derwent Innovations Index to measure the knowledge development in each technological field and apply the biological Lotka-Volterra (L-V) model to analyse the data across three separate time periods 1985-1996, 1997-2007, and 2008-2016. Our results show that the behaviour of the powertrain systems change over time as they have behaved as creative (or uncreative) and explorative (or exploitative). We also demonstrate that the powertrain systems go through temporal transitions where the relationship mode between them changes between amensalism, parasitism, commensalism, and symbiosis. In line with this we recommend that policy makers not only devise strategies (offensive or defensive) for each interaction modes but to also consider changing their strategies when there is transition between the modes. Furthermore, policy makers should consider the dual role of 'creation' and 'destruction' in their innovation policy mixes.

AB This paper adopts the Ansel & Gash (2008) model of collaborative governance to frame the structure of community-based trophy hunting (CBTH) programs as a form of collaborative governance that involves multiple stakeholders in the management of common pool resources. We conduct a meta-synthesis of 80 published studies on community-based conservation (CBC) and CBTH programs and develop contingency propositions that may help practitioners and governments to understand and implement programs that seek environmental conservation in collaboration with local communities.
   Regarding the initial conditions to engender CBTH in developing countries, we propose that the failure of conventional top-down conservation policies, perception of local communities about potential benefits from CBTH, and existence of facilitative leadership, such as local or international conservation NGOs will play critical roles in initiating CBTH, even under the prehistory of conflict, power imbalance, and lack of trust.
   We also propose organic and instrumental leadership from community and government and inclusive design that creates ground rules and basic protocols are important outside factors to induce stable and strong commitment from participants during the collaboration process.
   Inside collaborative process, constructive, trust-building face-to-face meetings and generation of intermediate outcomes are identified as crucial factors to building a momentum for successful CBTH outcomes.

AB The inadequacy of information impedes society's competence to find our the cause or degree of a problem or even to avoid further losses in an ecosystem. It becomes even harder to identify all the biological resources at risk because there is no exhaustive inventory of either fauna or flora of a particular region. Coastal forests of Kenya are located in the southeast part of Kenya and arc distributed mainly in four counties: Kwale, Kilifi, Lamu, and Tana River County. They are a stretch of fragmented forests ca. 30-120 km away from the Indian Ocean, and they have existed for millions of years. Diversity of both fauna and flora is very high in these relicts and the coastal forests of Eastern Africa, extending along the coast from Somalia through Kenya and Tanzania to Mozambique, are ranked among the priority biodiversity hotspot in the world. In spite of the high plant species richness and their importance towards supporting the livelihoods of the communities that live around them, floristic studies in these forests have remained poorly investigated. Hence, based on numerous field investigations, plant lists from published monograph/literature, and data from BRAHMS (Botanical Records and Herbarium Management System) database at East African herbarium (EA), we present a detailed checklist of vascular plants recorded in this region. Our results show that Kenyan coastal forests play an essential role in the flora of Kenya and the plant diversity of the coastal forests of East Africa. The checklist represents 176 families, 981 genera, 2489 species, 100 infraspecific taxa, 90 endemic plants species, 72 exotic species, and 120 species that are included in the current IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as species of major concern. We also discovered three new species to the world from these relicts. Thus, Kenyan coastal forests present a remarkable and significant center of plant diversity.

AB Differences in salinity are boundaries that act as barriers for the dispersal of most aquatic organisms. This creates distinctive biota in freshwater and brackish water (mesohaline) environments. To test how saline boundaries influence the diversity and composition of host-associated microbiota, we analyzed the microbiome within the digestive tract of Theodoxus fluviatilis, an organism able to cross the freshwater and mesohaline boundary. Alpha-diversity measures of the microbiome in freshwater and brackish water were not significantly different. However, the composition of the bacterial community within freshwater T. fluviatilis differed significantly compared with mesohaline T. fluviatilis and typical bacteria could be determined for the freshwater and the mesohaline digestive tract microbiome. An artificial increase in salinity surrounding these freshwater snails resulted in a strong change in the bacterial community and typical marine bacteria became more pronounced in the digestive tract microbiome of freshwater T. fluviatilis. However, the composition of the digestive tract microbiome in freshwater snails did not converge to that found within mesohaline snails. Within mesohaline snails, no cardinal change was found after either an increase or decrease in salinity. In all samples, Pseudomonas, Pirellula, Flavobacterium, Limnohabitans, and Acinetobacter were among the most abundant bacteria. These bacterial genera were largely unaffected by changes in environmental conditions. As permanent residents in T. fluviatilis, they may support the digestion of the algal food in the digestive tract. Our results show that freshwater and mesohaline water host-associated microbiomes respond differently to changes in salinity. Therefore, the salinization of coastal freshwater environments due to a rise in sea level can influence the gut microbiome and its functions with currently unknown consequences for, e.g., nutritional physiology of the host.

AB The Dujiangyan irrigation system, China's largest, is one of the world's most important examples of sustainable agropolitan development, maintained by a relatively decentralised system of governance that minimises bureaucratic oversight and depends on significant local autonomy at many scales down to the household. At its historic core in the Chengdu Plain, the system has supported over 2000 years of near-continuously stable urban culture, as well as some of the world's highest sustained long-term per-hectare productivity and diversity of grain and other crops, especially considering its high population density, forest cover, general biodiversity and flood management success. During the past decade, rapid urban expansion has turned the Chengdu Plain from a net grain exporter into a grain importer, and has radically transformed its productive functioning and distinctive scattered settlement pattern, reorganising much of the landscape into larger, corporately-managed farms, and more concentrated and infrastructure-intensive settlements of non-farming as well as farming households. Community-scale case studies of spatial-morphological and household socio-economic variants on the regional trend help to articulate what is at stake. Neither market-driven 'laissez-faire' rural development nor local state-driven spatial settlement consolidation and corporatisation of production seem to correlate well with important factors of resilience: landscape heterogeneity; crop diversity and food production; permaculture; and flexibility in household independence and choice of livelihood. Management of the irrigation system should be linked to community-based agricultural landscape preservation and productive dwelling, as sources of adaptive capacity crucial to the social-ecological resilience of the city-region, the nation and perhaps all humanity.

AB Coastal dune landscapes are subject to harsh environmental conditions and, owing to Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, comprise small, fragmented features. These environments present several challenges for plant colonization and persistence, and dune floras are therefore likely to be species-poor but endemic-rich. Here, we explore an explicitly historical hypothesis - the Pleistocene disturbance hypothesis - to explain patterns of plant diversity on Holocene dunes of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). This hypothesis predicts that: (1) dunes would not show the west-east decline in diversity evident in inland habitats as the unique selective regime of the dune environment would override the evolutionary diversity patterns evident elsewhere in the CFR; (2) dune diversity would be lower than in adjacent, inland habitats that were not exposed to extreme disturbance regimes during the Pleistocene. We tested this by compiling regional-scale plant species diversity data from dune and interior lowland habitats of the southwestern and southeastern CFR and subjecting the data to species-area analysis. Our results were consistent with the Pleistocene disturbance hypothesis: diversity patterns of dunes did not differ between the southwestern and southeastern subregions, and interior sites were richer in species than dune sites. However, the difference in diversity between interior and dune sites (1.42 x ) was remarkably marginal. We propose that this is a consequence of the CFR's glacial physiography, where a large expanse of dune habitat was exposed at length along the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain during Pleistocene sea-level lowstands. This vast habitat area would have facilitated the development of a species-rich dune flora. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation, yet the relative effectiveness of different conservation models is often unknown. Here, we describe seasonal population densities and associated annual population changes of ten wildlife species (elephant, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, waterbuck, warthog, Grant's gazelle, impala, Thomson's gazelle, and Kirk's dik-dik) in four protected areas in northern Tanzania over eight years and test two hypotheses: (1) annual wildlife population changes are positively correlated with conservation status; and, (2) relationships between annual population changes and protected area status are mediated by species' body mass. We carried out wildlife surveys from late 2011 to the end of 2018 and estimated wildlife densities in a line distance sampling framework. The majority of species occurred at high densities in fully protected areas, and larger-bodied species occurred at low densities or were absent in the least protected area. We estimated annual species- and area-specific population changes with generalized linear mixed effects that accounted for seasonal variation in this ecosystem. Using mull-model comparisons, we did not find evidence that annual population changes were correlated with body mass. However, species- and area-specific population changes appeared to vary by species and area, but were not consistently associated with protection status. Wildlife populations in Tarangire National Park and two human-dominated areas showed mainly stable or positive population trends, whereas wildlife populations in Lake Manyara National Park appeared to decline during the study period. This ecosystem- and long-term monitoring indicates apparent context-dependent differences in protected area performance within one ecosystem and exemplifies the need for, and challenges of, long-term monitoring in protected areas to guide effective conservation.

AB Community-based conservation models have been widely implemented across Africa to improve wildlife conservation and livelihoods of rural communities. In Tanzania, communities can set aside land and formally register it as Wildlife Management Area (WMA), which allows them to generate revenue via consumptive or nonconsumptive utilization of wildlife. The key, yet often untested, assumption of this model is that economic benefits accrued from wildlife motivate sustainable management of wildlife. To test the ecological effectiveness (here defined as persistence of wildlife populations) of Burunge Wildlife Management Area (BWMA), we employed a participatory monitoring approach involving WMA personnel. At intermittent intervals between 2011 and 2018, we estimated mammal species richness and population densities of ten mammal species (African elephant, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, wildebeest, waterbuck, warthog, impala, Kirk's dik-dik, and vervet monkey) along line transects. We compared mammal species accumulation curves and density estimates with those of time-matched road transect surveys conducted in adjacent Tarangire National Park (TNP). Mammal species richness estimates were similar in both areas, yet observed species richness per transect was greater in TNP compared to BWMA. Species-specific density estimates of time-matched surveys were mostly not significantly different between BWMA and TNP, but elephants occasionally reached greater densities in TNP compared to BWMA. In BWMA, elephant, wildebeest, and impala populations showed significant increases from 2011 to 2018. These results suggest that community-based conservation models can support mammal communities and densities that are similar to national park baselines. In light of the ecological success of this case study, we emphasize the need for continued efforts to ensure that the BWMA is effective. This will require adaptive management to counteract potential negative repercussions of wildlife populations on peoples' livelihoods. This study can be used as a model to evaluate the effectiveness of wildlife management areas across Tanzania.

AB There has been an increased concern about the invasiveness of Eucalyptus globules Labill. Much research has been devoted to understanding the factors influencing E. globulus recruitment. Standard management operations, performed inside and outside plantations, cause profound disturbances on soil and vegetation, potentially influence E. globulus recruitment, but have been poorly studied. This study, therefore, aims to understand the impacts of standard management operations on seeds and capsules shed prior or after such operations, and, together with weather, their influence on the germination and early survival of E. globulus seedlings. We performed a sowing experiment in Portugal using E. globulus seeds, following a full factorial design with 16 treatments, resulting from three factors: management operations (burning, soil stripping, soil harrowing and control); sowing time (before or after management operations); sowing type (sowing seeds or capsules). Each treatment was replicated 10 times, giving a total of 160 plots (0.5 x 05 m), each sown with 100 seeds or 10 capsules. Seeds and capsules were monitored for approximately one year. We also tested for the presence of seed predation close to the experimental field. Seed sowing resulted in 4.8% germination (379 seedlings), but capsule sowing resulted in only two seedlings. The seed predation experiment, showed that nearly half of the E. globulus seeds went missing, suggesting that predation may contribute to the low germination results. < 1.5 months after sowing, 96.3% of the total seedlings had emerged. A Multivariate Regression Tree and a Generalized Linear Mixed Model showed that the number of emerged seedlings was enhanced in plots sown with seeds, and after the management operations, particularly harrowing. Sowing before burning resulted in limited germination. The Cox Model showed that the survival probability was greatest for seeds shed after the soil treatments and in harrowing plots. A Linear Mixed Model showed the negative influence of soil harrowing and the positive effect of crop evapotranspiration on seedling mortality across time. This study shows that E. globulus seeds are able to germinate in distinct soil/vegetation management scenarios, even though some types of management operations, such as soil harrowing, may provide better conditions for germination and survival. Keeping dense competing vegetation is probably the most cost-effective option to minimize unwanted E. globulus recruitment and maximize seedling mortality.

Objectives Our objective was to estimate how wind disturbance shapes landscape-level patterns of engineering resilience, defined as the recovery of total biomass and species composition after a windstorm, under climate change in central Wisconsin. Methods We used a spatially-explicit, forest simulation model (LANDIS-II) to simulate how windstorms and climate change affect forest succession and used boosted regression tree analysis to isolate the important drivers of resilience. Results At mid-century, biomass fully recovered to current conditions, but neither biomass nor species composition completely recovered at the end of the century. As expected, resilience was lower in the south, but by the end of the century, resilience was low throughout the landscape. Disturbance and species' characteristics (e.g., the amount of area disturbed and the number of species) explained half of the variation in resilience, while temperature and soil moisture comprised only 17% collectively. Conclusions Our results illustrate substantial spatial patterns of resilience at landscape scales, while documenting the potential for overall declines in resilience through time. Species diversity and windstorm size were far more important than temperature and soil moisture in driving long term trends in resilience. Finally, our research highlights the utility of using machine learning (e.g., boosted regression trees) to discern the underlying mechanisms of landscape-scale processes when using complex spatially-interactive and non-deterministic simulation models.

AB In Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems (MCEs), Holocene coastal dunes comprise small, fragmented and dynamic features which have nutritionally imbalanced and excessively drained, droughty, sandy soils. These characteristics, along with summer drought and salt-laden winds, pose many challenges for plant colonization and persistence. Consequently, MCE dune floras are likely to be distinctive with a high proportion of habitat specialists and strong convergence in growth form mixes. Very little research has compared the species traits of dune floras within and across MCEs. This paper contributes to filling that gap. Here, we analyze the taxonomic, biological and geographical traits for all 402 species in a flora from a dune landscape (Cape St Francis) in the southeastern Cape Floristic Region (CFR) and compare patterns with the trait profiles of other dune floras at a regional (CFR) and global (MCE) scale. Within the CFR, the southeastern (all-year-rainfall) flora at Cape St Francis had a similar trait profile to western (winter-rainfall) dune floras, except for having a lower representation of species belonging to CFR-endemic clades, and higher number of species associated with tropical lineages. The St Francis flora, in common with other CFR and MCE floras, was dominated by members of the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Some 40% of the St Francis flora was endemic to the CFR, typical of the high rate of MCE-level endemism elsewhere in the CFR, and in other MCEs. About 30% of the flora was confined to calcareous sand, a value typical for many other MCE sites. The St Francis flora, as well as other CFR dune floras, differs from those of other MCEs by having many species associated with shrubby lineages, and by the relatively high incidence of species associated with tropical lineages. The growth form profile of the St Francis and other CFR floras shows strongest similarity with that of Australian MCE dunes in that in both regions, evergreen hemicryptophytes and shrubs share dominance, and annuals are floristically and ecologically subordinate. The least similar of MCEs to the St Francis trait profile is the Mediterranean Basin where annuals are the most frequent growth form while shrubs are subordinate. California and Chile dune floras appear to occupy an intermediate position, in terms of growth form mix, between the Cape and Australia on the one hand, where dune floras have retained features typical of nutrient-poor soils, and the Mediterranean Basin, where dwarf, deciduous shrubs and annuals dominate the life form spectrum. All MCE dunes are threatened by alien plants, infrastructure development, tourism demands and rising sea levels. The high incidence of species of conservation concern in CFR dune floras underestimates the exponentially increasing threats to their habitats, which are already historically at a much-reduced extent. All remaining coastal dune habitat in the CFR, and probably in other MCEs, should be conserved in their entirety.

AB The southern African Miombo and Mopane ecoregions constitute a unique repository of plant diversity whose diversification and evolutionary history is still understudied. In this work, we assessed the diversity, distribution, and conservation status of Miombo and Mopane tree legumes within the Zambezian phytoregion. Data were retrieved from several plant and gene databases and phylogenetic analyses were performed based on genetic barcodes. Seventy-eight species (74 from Miombo and 23 from Mopane, 19 common to both ecoregions) have been scored. Species diversity was high within both ecoregions, but information about the actual conservation status is scarce and available only for ca. 15% of the species. Results of phylogenetic analyses were consistent with current legume classification but did not allow us to draw any conclusion regarding the evolutionary history of Miombo and Mopane tree legumes. Future studies are proposed to dissect the diversity and structure of key species in order to consolidate the network of conservation areas.

AB Questions West African savanna ecosystems are affected by increasing land use intensity (e.g., agriculture and livestock herds) due to a growing human population. To understand the impact of land use intensification on savanna vegetation, we aim to answer the following questions: How do savanna species composition, diversity and structure change with increasing land use pressure? Are the impacts of land use change different in the woody and the herbaceous layers? Do the effects of land use change differ between vegetation types? Location Southeastern Burkina Faso, West Africa. Methods Vegetation plots from the early 1990s representing vegetation types occurring in fallows of different age and in uncultivated pasturing zones were resurveyed. We distinguished between woody (tree and shrub layer) and herbaceous vegetation types. Species composition changes were analyzed using ordination techniques (detrended correspondence analysis, DCA) and indicator species analysis (IndVal). Species turnover and plant diversity as represented by species richness and evenness were compared between the baseline survey and the resurvey. Results In most woody vegetation types, we found no change in species composition and richness over the past two decades. However, some highly valued woody species decreased in abundance. In contrast, in most herbaceous vegetation types, species composition changed considerably and species richness increased. The proportion of wide-ranging, ruderal herbaceous species increased, indicating a homogenization of herbaceous vegetation types, while preferred fodder herbaceous species decreased. We assume that the increased grazing intensity over the past two decades is the driver of these changes in the herbaceous layer. Conclusions Our results show different reactions of vegetation types and layers to land use intensification and reinforce the need for studies on the basis of vegetation type that incorporate both the herbaceous and the woody layers.

AB ContextResistance-based connectivity models are widely used conservation tools for spatial prioritization and corridor planning, but there are no generally accepted methods and recommendations for validating whether these models accurately predict actual movement routes. Hence, despite growing interest and recognition of the importance of protecting landscape connectivity, the practical utility of predictions derived from connectivity models remains unclear.ObjectivesThe difficulties in validations are mainly related to the unavailability of independent data and lack of appropriate, easily applied statistical frameworks. Here, we present a case study where two independently collected datasets were used to validate resistance-based landscape connectivity models and movement corridors identified by these models.MethodsWe used annual aerial counts to evaluate the connectivity model, and a field survey to assess the performance of predicted corridors. We applied these two independent datasets to validate a previously developed connectivity model for the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) in the Borderland region between Kenya and Tanzania.ResultsThe results of this study confirm that the resistance-based connectivity model is a valid approach for predicting movement corridors for the African elephant. We show that high connectivity values are a strong predictor of the presence of large numbers of the elephants across the years. The probability of observing elephants increased with increasing connectivity values, while accounting for seasonality is an important factor for accurately predicting movements from connectivity models.ConclusionMovement corridors derived from resistance-based connectivity models have a strong predictive power and can be successfully used in spatial conservation prioritization.

AB Decomposition is a vital ecosystem process, increasingly modified by human activity. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies that aim to understand the interplay between human land-use, macro-fauna and decomposition processes have primarily focused on leaf and wood litter. For a whole-plant understanding of how land-use and macro-fauna influence decomposition, investigating root litter is required. Using litterbags, we quantified rates of root decomposition across contrasting tropical savanna land-uses, namely wildlife and fire-dominated protected areas and livestock pastureland without fire. By scanning litterbags for termite intrusion, we differentiated termite and microbial driven decomposition. Root litter was buried underneath different tree canopies (leguminous and non-leguminous trees) and outside canopies to account for savanna landscape effects. Additionally, we established a termite cafeteria-style experiment and common garden to explore termite selectivity of root litter and root trait relationships, respectively. After one year, we found no significant differences in root litter mass loss between wildlife dominated areas and pastureland. Instead, we found consistent species differences in root litter mass loss across land-uses and additive and non-additive effects of termites on root decomposition across plant species. Termite selectivity for root litter species occurred for both root and leaf litter buried near termite mounds, but was not explained by root traits measured in the common garden. Termite foraging was greater under leguminous tree canopies than other canopies; however, this did not influence rates of root decomposition. Our study suggests that land-use has a weak direct effect on belowground processes in savannas. Instead, changes in herbaceous species composition and termite foraging have stronger impacts on belowground decomposition. Moreover, termites were not generalist decomposers of root litter, but their impact varies depending on plant species identity and likely associated root traits. This root litter selectivity by termites is likely to be an important contributor to spatial heterogeneity in savanna nutrient cycling.

AB Ascidians belonging to Phlebobranchia accumulate vanadium to an extraordinary degree (<= 350 mM). Vanadium levels are strictly regulated and vary among ascidian species; thus, they represent well-suited models for studies on vanadium accumulation. No comprehensive study on metal accumulation and reduction in marine organisms in relation to their symbiotic bacterial communities has been published. Therefore, we performed comparative 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analyses on samples from three tissues (branchial sac, intestine, and intestinal lumen) involved in vanadium absorption, isolated from two vanadium-rich (Ascidia ahodori and Ascidia sydneiensis samea) and one vanadium-poor species (Styela plicata). For each sample, the abundance of every bacteria and an abundance value normalized to their abundance in seawater were calculated and compared. Two bacterial genera, Pseudomonas and Ralstonia, were extremely abundant in the branchial sacs of vanadium-rich ascidians. Two bacterial genera, Treponema and Borrelia, were abundant and enriched in the intestinal content of vanadium-rich ascidians. The results suggest that specific selective forces maintain the bacterial population in the three ascidian tissues examined, which contribute to successful vanadium accumulation. This study furthers the understanding of the relationship between bacterial communities and metal accumulation in marine life.

AB Ecosystems increasingly face concurrent invasions by multiple species, but knowledge about relationships among invasive species is under studied. We examined agonistic encounters among signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis, and the common yabby Cherax destructor, none native to Europe, to assess the influence of aggression on their success in a sympatric environment. In interspecific interactions, similar-sized signal crayfish were significantly more likely to initiate aggressive encounters and won significantly more fights against similar-sized opponents. The marbled crayfish was the least aggressive and least successful in agonistic interactions. The mean number of fights, fight duration, and number and duration of low and high intensity fights varied significantly between intra- and inter-specific interactions, tending to be more pronounced in conspecific encounters. We concluded that crayfish species differ in fighting strategies employed during intra- and inter-specific interactions. Of the species evaluated, the signal crayfish shows the highest potential to establish dominance. However, factors such as growth rate, reproductive potential, ecosystem variables, and temperature of habitat may alter the competitiveness of an invader.

AB Ostional in Costa Rica is the second largest nesting site of the olive ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea, which is categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In Ostional the local community helps maintain the nesting site and collects olive ridley eggs for consumption and trade within Costa Rica. Since its inception in 1987 the egg harvesting project has integrated sea turtle conservation with community development. We assessed the current status of this project in terms of community awareness, dependency, involvement and perceptions, using a household survey and semi-structured interviews with key informants. We also compared some of our findings with those of previous studies at the site, finding that the project has fewer dependents, primary livelihood activities have shifted towards tourism and hospitality, and respondents are more aware about environmental conservation and stewardship. We map outcomes of the project with the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, and suggest that further capacity building for research and tourism could contribute towards sustaining the turtle population, local livelihoods, and the community-based conservation institution.

AB Resource endowment and resource carrying capacity (RCC) are the most important cornerstones of regional sustainable development. By applying a newly established RCC method, namely, the relative resources carrying capacity (RRCC) method, we evaluated the RCC in the Tarim River basin (TRB) in arid China in Xinjiang during 2000-2011. Research results show that the relative resources carrying capacity can be effectively served as indicators of regional resources sustainable development status. Taking Xinjiang as the reference region, the TRB can be characterized as an area with an overloaded population and surplus economy during the whole research period, where land resources are relative advantage resources carrying the regional population growth and economic development and water resources are relative disadvantage resources restricting rapid regional development. Taking TRB as the reference region, 42 counties and cities in TRB performed significant temporal and spatial disparities according to the RRCC based on population and economic perspectives. Based on the spatial-temporal evolution of RRCC, 42 counties and cities in TRB were classified into four matching modes (A, B, C, and D). The spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and mechanisms about the 42 prefectures and cities were examined, and the suitable development strategies for every different mode were recommended.

AB Adaptation to local host plants may impact a pollinator's population genetic structure by reducing gene flow and driving population genetic differentiation, representing an early stage of ecological speciation. South African Rediviva longimanus bees exhibit elongated forelegs, a bizarre adaptation for collecting oil from floral spurs of their Diascia hosts. Furthermore, R. longimanus foreleg length (FLL) differs significantly among populations, which has been hypothesised to result from selection imposed by inter-population variation in Diascia floral spur length. Here, we used a pooled restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (pooled RAD-seq) approach to investigate the population genetic structure of R. longimanus and to test if phenotypic differences in FLL translate into increased genetic differentiation (i) between R. longimanus populations and (ii) between phenotypes across populations. We also inferred the effects of demographic processes on population genetic structure and tested for genetic markers underpinning local adaptation.ResultsPopulations showed marked genetic differentiation (average F-ST=0.165), though differentiation was not statistically associated with differences between populations in FLL. All populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and were inferred to have gone through recent bottleneck events, suggesting extremely low effective population sizes. Genetic differentiation between samples pooled by leg length (short versus long) rather than by population of origin was even higher (F-ST=0.260) than between populations, suggesting reduced interbreeding between long and short-legged individuals. Signatures of selection were detected in 1119 (3.8%) of a total of 29,721 SNP markers,ConclusionsPopulations of R. longimanus appear to be small, bottlenecked and isolated. Though we could not detect the effect of local adaptation (FLL in response to floral spurs of host plants) on population genetic differentiation, short and long legged bees appeared to be partially differentiated, suggesting incipient ecological speciation. To test this hypothesis, greater resolution through the use of individual-based whole-genome analyses is now needed to quantify the degree of reproductive isolation between long and short legged bees between and even within populations.

AB The success of different rehabilitation treatments following surface mining on the arid west coast of South Africa was assessed. Treatments consisting of one or a combination of topsoil addition, plant translocation and seeding were applied to experimental rehabilitation sites in 2001, while the treatment of another site in 2008 combined all three techniques. Vegetation and species cover, species richness, diversity and evenness, and grazing capacity of rehabilitation sites were sampled during winter 2009 and summer 2010, and compared with a reference site. All rehabilitated sites achieved the objective to attain a minimum grazing capacity of 20 ha per small stock unit. Rehabilitation trials were successful in establishing a vegetation cover, but were unable to return species richness and diversity to reference levels and did not resemble the reference site in species composition. Common species in reference sites were absent or only occurred in low numbers. No treatment outperformed the others and further experimentation is needed to determine the most suitable combination. It is recommended that rehabilitation should be done in multiple stages in future to improve seedling survival and to return species that are unable to establish in the adverse conditions present at the onset of rehabilitation.

AB The intention of India's Smart City Mission program is to achieve better living conditions in a sustainable environment with smart solutions. This program identifies the key challenges of urbanization and the environment. The mitigation of these challenges depends on the monitoring and assessment of multiple factors, including demography, education, health, and the environment; however, the inclusion of environmental factors are limited. The monitoring and assessment of environmental factors will continuously generate big data and hence would require scientific and technological innovation for a sustainable management plan. This study identifies six environmental factors, which should be integrated in the development of smart cities. These environmental factors include indicators of landscape and geography, climate, atmospheric pollution, water resources, energy resources, and urban green space as a major component of the environment. This paper also discusses the importance of these environmental components and the maintenance of big data in the management of smart cities.

AB Effective management of threatened wildlife, particularly large carnivores, depends on a sound understanding of their spatial distribution and status in relationship to environmental or anthropogenic impacts. Here, we analyse data from spoor surveys to investigate occurrence across a multiple-use landscape in the Tarangire-Simanjiro ecosystem in northern Tanzania for four taxa of African large carnivores: lions (Panthera leo), hyaenas (spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and striped hyaenas (Hyaena hyaena) combined), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and leopards (P. pardus). We analysed our data using occupancy modelling, explicitly accounting for detectability, to identify associations with environmental and anthropogenic variables. Overall occurrence was estimated at 0.85 (SE = 0.06) for hyaena, 0.82 (SE = 0.15) for cheetah, 0.55 (SE = 0.10) for lion and 0.61 (SE = 0.21) for leopard. Lion occurrence was negatively associated with distance to park boundary. Hyaena occurrence was positively associated with human population density and negatively associated with bushland, while cheetah and leopard occurrences were positively associated with grassland. These results suggest that lions may be more vulnerable to human impacts than other species, while hyaenas may benefit from vicinity to humans. Our study demonstrates the value of spoor-based occupancy surveys for understanding distribution and habitat use of secretive large carnivores.

AB Bivalves are among the main groups of invasive freshwater species, with the Asian clam genus Corbicula in particular being widely distributed. While global studies have focused on Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774), the invasive potential of Corbicula largillierti (Philippi, 1844) and Corbicula fluminalis (Muller, 1774) is still unknown. The spread of invasive species may be intensified by climate change. We estimated and compared environmentally suitable areas for these species under hypothetical climate scenarios, generating global maps of invasion risk. We found large climatically suitable areas for C. largillierti and C. fluminalis (under species distribution models) and that their invasive potential is currently underestimated. The analysis revealed many areas in which changing climate may favour the invasion of Corbicula spp.

AB Despite scientific interest in the investigation of biogeochemical changes in meltwaters of the Antarctic Peninsula, we still lack an understanding of the seasonal dynamics and release of dissolved and particulate carbon, nutrients, as well as trace metals from Antarctic snowpacks. Harsh conditions, lack of appreciation of the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as logistical constraints during fieldwork mean there is great demand for more detailed and comprehensive research. Therefore, a unique, comprehensive study of snowpack biogeochemistry was performed in the Ryder Bay area of the Antarctic Peninsula during the entire 2016/2017 melt season. Two-hundred snowpack and snowmelt samples were collected throughout the campaign, to quantify for the first time, seasonal dynamics and export of dissolved carbon, in-vivo chlorophyll, nutrient, and trace metals from Antarctic snowpack in various locations. Our study uncovered the importance of environmental heterogeneity with respect to the export of solutes and carbon. A distinctive split in the temporal dynamics of solute export was found, suggesting that some solutes are rapidly delivered to coastal environments early in the summer whilst others are delivered more gradually throughout it. Coastal, low elevation snowpacks were identified as "power plants" of microbial activity, playing an important role in the regulation of land-ocean fluxes of labile carbon and bio-limiting macro- and micro-nutrients. We also found that multiannual snow residing deep below the surface can further contribute to biogeochemical enrichment of coastal ecosystems. Additionally, inland snowpack have been identified as a store for nutrients, dissolved organic carbon and chlorophyll. Lastly, we show that a number of factors (environmental characteristics, geochemical heterogeneity, and internal biogeochemical processes in snow) make simple snowpack surveys insufficient for the prediction of biogeochemical fluxes carried by snowmelt runoff into the marine environment. A return to significant fieldwork-based research in Antarctica is therefore necessary to advance our knowledge of the complex biogeochemical processes occurring there. This study provides crucial data and process insights for more accurate predictions of how changing climate will influence the Antarctic carbon cycle and the globally important Southern Ocean ecosystem.

AB One of the modern antibacterial strategies to control various infectious pathogens in agriculture, veterinary medicine, and the food industry is the use of bacteriocins, which are potent antimicrobial peptides produced by almost all species of bacteria. The wide distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as the increasing awareness of the importance of the normal human biocenosis for health, necessitates the study of this new class of antimicrobial agents, whose application is recognized an alternative strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases. Among diverse marine organisms, bacteria are considered the most numerous. They are a promising source of bacteriocins, which play an important role in regulating competitive interactions in marine microbial systems. In the marine environment, with its high competition for space and resources, bacteria produce more potent bacteriocins than those isolated from other ecosystems. The scientific substantiation of the relevance of the research on the biological properties of these peptides is associated with the prospect of industrial cultivation of their producers in maricultures, as well as with the use of bacteriocins for medical and veterinary purposes.

AB The available information on capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) meat, an important resource for the subsistence of many traditional communities in several South American countries, is reviewed. Some features of the species, such as an herbivorous diet, high prolificacy, rapid growth rate, tameness, and social behaviour, which allow its commercial use through harvesting in Venezuela and farming in Brazil, where commercial hunting is not allowed, is discussed. Key characteristics of capybara meat, is low saturated fat and cholesterol content. Discussions about management and handling practices regarding animal welfare and capybara meat quality are also highlighted. After commenting on ethical, political, and economic implications of wildlife use it is concluded that capybara meat has an extraordinary potential to satisfy the growing demand for healthy and high quality protein of animal origin for the subsistence of many people in the Neotropics.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have a significant influence on plant productivity and diversity in non-grazing grassland. However, the interactive effects between grazing intensity and AMP on plant community composition in natural grassland communities are not well known. We conducted a field experiment that manipulated AMF colonization and grazing intensity to study the impact of AMF suppression on plant community composition and nutrient status over 2 years (2015-2016) with contrasting rainfall levels. We found that AMF root colonization was significantly reduced by the application of the fungicide benomyl as a soil drench. Grazing intensity regulated plant community composition and aboveground biomass mainly by reducing the growth of Leymus chinensis over 2 years. AMF suppression increased the growth of Chenopodium glaucum, but it did not alter other plant species across all grazing intensities. The effects of AMF suppression on plant community composition changed along a grazing gradient considerably between years: AMF suppression increased the biomass of C. glaucum across all grazing intensities in 2015, but slightly increased it in 2016. Interactions between AMF suppression and grazing intensity altered the phosphorus concentration of Stipa grandis and Cleistogenes squarrosa in 2015 but not in 2016. AMF suppression decreased the shoot phosphorus content of L. chinensis but increased that of C. glaucum across all grazing intensities. Our results indicate that grazing intensity substantially alters aboveground community biomass and affects growth of dominant species; AMF by itself have limited effects on plant communities along a grazing gradient in typical steppe.

AB Plant species range shifts are predicted to occur in response to climate change. The predictions are often based on the assumption that climate is the primary factor limiting the distribution of species. However the distribution of grassy biomes in Africa cannot be predicted by climate alone, instead interactions between vegetation, climate and disturbance structure the ecosystems. To test if climatic variables, as predicted by an environmental niche model, determine the distribution limits of two common savanna tree species we established a transplant experiment at a range of latitudes and altitudes much broader than the distribution limits of our study species. We planted seedlings of two common savanna trees, Senegalia nigrescens and Colophospermum mopane, at eight paired high and low elevation sites across an 850 km latitudinal gradient in South African savannas. At each site seedlings were planted in both grassy and cleared plots. After 2 years of growth, rainfall, temperature and location inside or outside their distribution range did not explain species success. Grass competition was the only variable that significantly affected plant growth rates across all sites, but grass competition alone could not explain the distribution limit. Species distributions were best predicted when maximum tree growth rates were considered in relation to local fire return intervals. The probability of sapling escape from the fire trap was the most likely determinant of distribution limits of these two species. As trees grew and survived 100 s of kilometers south of their current range limits we conclude that climate alone does not explain the current distribution of these trees, and that climate change adaptation strategies for savanna environments based only on climatic envelope modeling will be inappropriate.

AB Non-native invasive plants are among the main threats to global biodiversity, including insects, and it is thus important to understand the mechanisms of how invasive plants impact native species. The community composition of nocturnal Lepidoptera was studied in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) in stands of native deciduous trees and in stands dominated by the invasive tree Robinia pseudoacacia, using automatic portable light traps together with an assessment of habitat characteristics. Native stands had more closed canopies and poorly developed understories. Conversely, R. pseudoacacia stands were more open and heterogeneous, with sparse canopies, well-developed shrub layers and a higher cover of taller herbs. Moth species richness, abundance and biomass were lower in R. pseudoacacia, likely due to the low richness of canopy herbivores not adapted to feed on the exotic host. However, feeding guilds associated with the understorey were more represented in stands of R. pseudoacacia, likely due to the more heterogeneous habitat structure. The Lepidopteran communities observed in stands of R. pseudoacacia resembled communities of open-forests or forest-steppe habitats. In contrast, native stands were dominated by Lepidoptera associated with trees, including forest specialists but also habitat generalists. From a conservation perspective, it appears that the invasive R. pseudoacacia created structurally more heterogeneous environment and more Lepidopteran open-forest guilds were associated with this habitat. However, further spread of R. pseudoacacia should be prevented because it reduces the species richness of Lepidoptera. Simultaneously, we recommend increasing the habitat heterogeneity of native forests to support functionally more diverse Lepidopteran communities.

AB Domestic herbivores' effect on vegetation is spatially heterogeneous, being one of the major causes of forage resources degradation. It has been proposed that paddock size controls grazing impact's heterogeneity because as size decreases, herbivores' utilization is spatially more even. However, this has not been critically evaluated in commercial-scale paddocks isolating paddock size effects from other factors influencing the interaction between herbivores and vegetation. Here we assessed how paddock size mediates the heterogeneity of continuous sheep grazing effects on vegetation, at constant stocking rate in Patagonian steppes. We selected three small (ca. 110 ha) and three large (ca. 1 100 ha) paddocks dominated by the same plant community. All paddocks contained a single watering point and presented similar shape. Total and specific plant cover, vegetation patchiness, population size distribution of dominant grass species, plant morphology, and sheep feces density were estimated at increasing distances from watering points. Relationships between vegetation variables and distance from the watering point were in most cases asymptotic exponential, although responses generally differed between small and large paddocks. In small paddocks, vegetation variables mostly reached a plateau at a short distance from the watering point (similar to 200 m).Instead, in large paddocks, the changes in vegetation variables were larger and more gradual, and reached a plateau at much greater distances (similar to 2 000 m). Vegetation heterogeneity throughout the paddock was lower in small than large paddocks. Our findings suggest that paddock sizemediates the spatial pattern of grazing effects on vegetation. Reducing paddock size decreases grazing impacts spatial heterogeneity, which makes plant-animal interactions more predictable and might improve forage utilization efficiency.

AB Plant species that are effective colonisers of transient habitats are expected to have a capacity for uniparental reproduction and show flexibility in pollination systems. Such traits may enable populations to be established from a small number of founding individuals without these populations succumbing to reductions in fecundity arising from pollinator limitation. We tested these predictions for Aloe thraskii (Xanthorrhoeaceae), a succulent treelet that colonises shifting coastal dunes and has both bird and bee pollinators. We performed hand-pollination experiments, and selectively excluded bird visitors to determine differences in pollinator effectiveness. We measured pollinator visitation rates and fecundity in populations varying in their size, density and isolation distance. Controlled hand-pollinations revealed that unlike most other Aloe species, A.thraskii is self-compatible and thus capable of uniparental reproduction. The species does however depend on pollinators and is visited by various bird species as well as by bees. Fruit and seed set are not affected by selective exclusion of birds, thus indicating that bees are effective pollinators. Bird visitation rates increased with increasing plant height and population size, while bee visitation rates increased with increasing population size and density. We found that seed set per flower was lower in large populations than in small populations. These results suggest that establishment of populations of A.thraskii from a small number of individuals is unlikely to be limited by the fecundity of individual plants.

AB We use numerical methods to explore patterns of vertebrate endemism in south-eastern Africa, refining the boundaries of the intuitively-defined Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot, also proposing a zoogeographic regionalisation. An incidence matrix of 300 vertebrate species endemic to south-eastern Africa sensu lato in 37 operational geographic units were used in (a) phenetic cluster analysis (PCA) using the algorithm of unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (phenetic approach), and (b) parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE; parsimony approach), in order to numerically evaluate the bioregional delimitations. The analyses provide a valid biogeographical entity 37% larger than the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot, but substantially (131%) higher in vertebrate endemicity viz. the Greater Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (GMPA) region of vertebrate endemism. South-east Africa is recognised as a dominion in the global zoogeographical area hierarchy, with subordinate units including the GMPA province. Various spatially-based measures of endemism were mapped for vertebrate species restricted to the dominion, i.e. endemic to south-eastern Africa sensu stricto. Areas and centres of endemism detected respectively from PAE and PCA, within the south-east Africa dominion also support the refined boundary of the GMPA region of endemism, which provides a better spatial conservation priority compared to the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot. Reptiles and amphibians are found to be the main drivers of the overall pattern of endemism, while the pattern in freshwater fish is the most distinctive. Our analyses also indicate a good congruence of the centres of endemism across different terrestrial vertebrate taxa.

AB While foundation species can stabilize ecosystems at landscape scales, their ability to persist is often underlain by keystone interactions occurring at smaller scales. Acacia drepanolobium is a foundation tree, comprising >95% of woody cover in East African black-cotton savanna ecosystems. Its dominance is underlain by a keystone mutualistic interaction with several symbiotic ant species in which it provides housing (swollen thorns) and carbohydrate-rich nectar from extra-floral nectaries (EFN). In return, it gains protection from catastrophic damage from mega-herbivores. Crematogaster mimosae is the ecologically dominant symbiotic ant in this system, also providing the highest protection services. In addition to tending EFN, C. mimosae tend scale insects for carbohydrate-rich honeydew. We investigated the role of scale insects in this specialized ant-plant interaction. Specifically, does this putatively redundant third partner strengthen the ant-plant mutualism by making the ant a better protector of the tree? Or does it weaken the mutualism by being costly to the tree while providing no additional benefit to the ant-plant mutualism? We coupled observational surveys with two scale-manipulation experiments and found evidence that this third partner strengthens the ant-plant mutualism. Trees with scale insects experimentally removed experienced a 2.5X increase in elephant damage compared to trees with scale insects present over 10 months. Reduced protection was driven by scale removal causing a decrease in ant colony size and per capita baseline activity and defensive behavior. We also found that ants increased scale-tending and the density of scale insects on trees when EFN were experimentally reduced. Thus, in this system, scale insects and EFN are likely complementary, rather than redundant, resources with scale insects benefitting ants when EFN production is low (such as during annual dry periods in this semi-arid ecosystem). This study reveals that a third-partner strengthens an ant-plant mutualism that serves to stabilize a whole ecosystem.

AB Savannas are mixed tree-grass ecosystems whose dynamics are predominantly regulated by resource competition and the temporal variability in climatic and environmental factors such as rainfall and fire. Hence, increasing inter-annual rainfall variability due to climate change could have a significant impact on savannas. To investigate this, we used an ecohydrological model of stochastic differential equations and simulated African savanna dynamics along a gradient of mean annual rainfall (520-780 mm/year) for a range of inter-annual rainfall variabilities. Our simulations produced alternative states of grassland and savanna across the mean rainfall gradient. Increasing inter-annual variability had a negative effect on the savanna state under dry conditions (520 mm/year), and a positive effect under moister conditions (580-780 mm/year). The former resulted from the net negative effect of dry and wet extremes on trees. In semi-arid conditions (520 mm/year), dry extremes caused a loss of tree cover, which could not be recovered during wet extremes because of strong resource competition and the increased frequency of fires. At high mean rainfall (780 mm/year), increased variability enhanced savanna resilience. Here, resources were no longer limiting and the slow tree dynamics buffered against variability by maintaining a stable population during 'dry' extremes, providing the basis for growth during wet extremes. Simultaneously, high rainfall years had a weak marginal benefit on grass cover due to density-regulation and grazing. Our results suggest that the effects of the slow tree and fast grass dynamics on tree-grass interactions will become a major determinant of the savanna vegetation composition with increasing rainfall variability.

AB Landscape context and site history, including antecedent site conditions, may constrain restoration potential despite the efforts of restoration practitioners. However, few experimental studies have investigated the relative importance of antecedent site conditions and the intensity of on-site management in driving restoration outcomes. We established small-scale prairie restoration experiments within the Lost Mound Unit of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge in Illinois, U.S.A. We investigated the effectiveness of two restoration treatments, herbicide application and seeding of native plants, on removal of invasive crown-vetch (Securigera varia) and recovery of sand prairie plant communities. We replicated treatment plots across 15 locations with three levels of antecedent condition and fire treatment (burned, undegraded; burned, degraded; and unburned, degraded) to determine whether antecedent condition constrained the effectiveness of on-site restoration. Two years after initial herbicide application crown-vetch cover was significantly reduced relative to untreated controls. This effect was more pronounced in plots treated twice with herbicide. However, removal of crown-vetch facilitated invasion by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis). Addition of native prairie seed had little effect on restoration outcomes, regardless of herbicide application. Native community recovery was greater in plots restored in less degraded locations. Herbicide application tended to increase native species cover, but importantly, this effect was significant only in the least degraded locations. Intensive restoration management conducted in degraded landscapes can result in undesirable outcomes such as secondary species invasion. Reestablishment of native species following restoration is more likely where the surrounding remnant communities are intact.

AB Chemical analysis of the dichloromethane fraction obtained from aerial parts of the Northern African endemic plant Daucus virgatus led to the isolation of three previously undescribed sesquiterpenoids, namely the daucane vaginatin B, a eudesmane and the elemane elemavirgolide, along with five known metabolites. The structures of these compounds were determined by a detailed MS and NMR analysis and they were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against three human cell lines, A375 (melanoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), and HACAT (keratinocyte). The phytoalexin 6-methoxymellein revealed a previously unreported antiproliferative activity, while the eudesmane and the elemane derivatives exhibited a selective activity (SI = 11.1 and 3.3, respectively) against melanoma tumor cell lines.

AB Sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) is a popular seafood source in Asia, including South Korea, and its consumption has recently increased with recognition of its medicinal properties. However, because raw sea cucumber contains various microbes, its ingestion can cause foodborne illness. Therefore, analysis of the microbiota in the whole body of sea cucumber can extend our understanding of foodborne illness caused by microorganisms and help to better manage products. We collected 40 sea cucumbers from four different sites in August and November, which are known as the maximum production areas in Korea. The microbiota was analyzed by an Illumina MiSeq system, and bacterial amounts were quantified by real-time PCR. The diversity and bacterial amounts in sea cucumber were higher in August than in November. Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria were common dominant classes in all samples. However, the microbiota composition differed according to sampling time and site. Staphylococcus warneri and Propionibacterium acnes were commonly detected potential pathogens in August and November samples, respectively. The effect of experimental Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection on the indigenous microbiota of sea cucumber was analyzed at different temperatures, revealing clear alterations of Psychrobacter and Moraxella; thus, these shifts can be used as indicators for monitoring infection of sea cucumber. Although further studies are needed to clarify and understand the virulence and mechanisms of the identified pathogens of sea cucumber, our study provides a valuable reference for determining the potential of foodborne illness caused by sea cucumber ingestion and to develop monitoring strategies of products using microbiota information.

AB Quantifying the drivers of biodiversity variation is a key topic in contemporary ecology. While the geographic distribution of biodiversity is broadly determined by water and energy, local environmental conditions may be important. We evaluated the relative effects of spatial and temporal variation on taxonomic diversity of ground living arthropod communities in central South Africa. Seasonal climate variation was a major driver of arthropod abundance, but seasonal effects differed between habitats. We did not find any evidence for modular community structures, even across different habitats, or any evidence for a nested pattern across seasons. Instead, we observed a spatial nestedness which was only partly related to specific habitats. Our results suggest that neutral processes had influenced arthropod community structure, but also that very local processes may have been pivotal in determining local and regional arthropod diversity. Such processes may not necessarily have been neutral, but could have been caused by niche deterministic processes acting at scales smaller the distinct habitat classes we used for our study. We further suggest that alterations in climate likely will have substantial effects on the spatial and temporal distribution of arthropod diversity in this arid region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigate the sliding of objects on an inclined granular surface close to the avalanche threshold. Our experiments show that the stability is driven by the surface deformations. Heavy objects generate footprintlike deformations which stabilize the objects on the slopes. Light objects do not disturb the sandy surfaces and are also stable. For intermediate weights, the deformations of the surface generate a sliding of the objects. The solid friction coefficient does not follow the Amontons-Coulomb laws, but is found minimal for a characteristic pressure. Applications to the locomotion of devices and animals on sandy slopes as a function of their mass are proposed.

AB Areas of land abandonment and agriculture expansion usually differ in location and associated environmental characteristics; thus, land-use redistribution affects the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. In a subtropical region undergoing land redistribution patterns characteristic of Latin America, we estimated 20-year changes in food production, above-ground carbon stocks and soil erosion due to land cover change, and the potential effects of such redistribution of forests on the diversity of birds and mammals. Between 1986 and 2006, despite only 0.3% of net forest cover change, 7% of the total area (ca. 280,000 has) switched between forest and non-forest covers. Food production increased by 46%, while the estimated ecosystem services changed by less than 10%. Forest carbon remained stable, with gains in montane humid forests compensating for losses in lowlands. Modeled soil erosion increased, but sediment accumulation at the watershed bottom remained stable. The responses of birds and mammals to forest redistribution differed and were stronger in birds. Due to the strong responses of birds to forest loss, lowland bird communities might be especially threatened by current land-use trends. Results suggest that land redistribution associated with the adjustment of agriculture towards soils suitable for mechanized agriculture can help mitigate associated losses in ecosystem services and biodiversity, but species and supporting services depending on easily-converted ecosystems require appropriate landscape management practices.

AB A crucial step in adapting to urban habitat is switching to novel, often man-made, resources. Switching to a novel resource can influence the dynamics of species coexistence, particularly if it alters trade-offs in performance. While such switches are frequently documented, their influence on species coexistence has been difficult to assess because it requires knowledge of performance trade-offs in the context of both historical and novel resource use. Western and mountain bluebirds provide a unique system in which to investigate the effects of a resource switch on species coexistence because both depend on secondary nest cavities to breed and, across a large part of their range, have switched to using man-made nest boxes. Western bluebirds are less dispersive, but more aggressive, than mountain bluebirds leading to a successional pattern of species replacement in many nest box populations; however, there is evidence of continued coexistence in natural post-fire habitat. Nest boxes differ from natural cavities in both distribution, which may affect the dynamics of interference competition between the species, and thermal conductance, which may impact competition by altering survival of ectothermic young. Here, we use a combination of experimental manipulations of nest box density and more than a decade of fitness and incubation temperature data to investigate whether altered resource distribution or thermal environment best explain patterns of species replacement in nest box populations. In both species, we found that females breeding in nest boxes were unable to maintain normal incubation temperatures during inclement weather and experienced similar offspring mortality patterns. Moreover, climatic variation across populations did not predict species' relative abundance. Instead, experimental manipulation of nest box density showed that mountain bluebirds persisted longer when nest boxes were distributed farther apart, suggesting that nest box distribution may be a key factor in understanding how human-created habitat impacts coexistence of bluebird species. These results emphasize that knowledge of species interactions in the historical habitat is crucial to understanding population dynamics as species transition to novel, man-made habitat.

AB Habitat loss and climate change are primary drivers of global biodiversity loss. Species will need to track changing environmental conditions through fragmented and transformed landscapes such as KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Landscape connectivity is an important tool for maintaining resilience to global change. We develop a coarse-grained connectivity map between protected areas to aid decision-making for implementing corridors to maintain floristic diversity in the face of global change. The spatial location of corridors was prioritised using a biological underpinning of floristic composition that incorporated high beta diversity regions, important plant areas, climate refugia, and aligned to major climatic gradients driving floristic pattern. We used Linkage Mapper to develop the connectivity network. The resistance layer was based on landcover categories with natural areas discounted according to their contribution towards meeting the biological objectives. Three corridor maps were developed; a conservative option for meeting minimum corridor requirements, an optimal option for meeting a target amount of 50% of the landscape and an option including linkages in highly transformed areas. The importance of various protected areas and critical linkages in maintaining landscape connectivity are discussed, disconnected protected areas and pinch points identified where the loss of small areas could compromise landscape connectivity. This framework is suggested as a way to conserve floristic diversity into the future and is recommended as an approach for other global connectivity initiatives. A lack of implementation of corridors will lead to further habitat loss and fragmentation, resulting in further risk to plant diversity.

AB Species targeted by fishing often recover in abundance and size within marine protected areas (MPAs) resulting in increased reproductive potential. However, in some situations, concomitant changes in the abundance of predators, competitors, or prey within MPAs, or strong gradients in the surrounding environmental seascape may counteract the purported benefits making it more difficult to predict how species will respond to protection. We used a network of MPAs in California, spanning a large temperature gradient, to investigate the drivers of demographic variability in the commercially important red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus. We investigated how demographic metrics varied geographically in response to protection, temperature, and the main sea urchin resource, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. We found significant conservation benefits to this fished sea urchin within MPAs designated six years prior to the beginning of this study. Within MPAs, red sea urchins were generally larger resulting in greater adult biomass density and reproductive biomass density. In addition, kelp density was an important explanatory variable of all red sea urchin demographic traits examined (adult size, gonadosomatic index [GSI], density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density). Kelp density was positively correlated with red sea urchin GSI and adult size, but the relationships with density, adult biomass density, and reproductive biomass density were complex and the directionality changed depending on the region (or environmental setting) examined. Our results demonstrate that kelp, red sea urchin reproduction, and the effects of spatial management on demographic processes are tightly coupled with the oceanographic regime.

AB Community dynamics are often influenced by processes operating at large spatial scales. For example, the structure and dynamics of rocky intertidal communities depend not only on local factors, but also on the nearshore oceanic processes that affect the delivery of nutrients, propagules, and food particles. Conceptual models such as the grazer-reversal hypothesis predict that grazers will decrease the diversity of primary producers in nutrient-poor environments and increase diversity in nutrient-rich environments. To test this hypothesis, natural variation in the productivity of nearshore waters around the south island of New Zealand was used as a backdrop against which the occurrence of limpets, the dominant grazers, was experimentally manipulated. Limpets were either excluded or allowed access to replicate plots at five sites, two of relatively high nutrient availability and three of relatively low nutrient availability. Limpets had a negative effect on algal species richness and bio-mass at the nutrient-poor sites and little effect at the nutrient-rich sites, thus supporting the predictions of the grazer-reversal hypothesis. Results from this experiment suggest that in contrast to earlier results in the low zone, in the high zone of the rocky intertidal stronger bottom up effects (higher nutrients) did not "flow" up the food chain (to the herbivore level) to produce stronger top down effects. This finding is consistent with the idea that increasing environmental stress can alter the strength and direction of species interactions expected under a top-down/bottom-up scenario.

AB Collective properties of biodiversity, such as beta diversity, are suggested as complementary measures of species richness to guide the prioritisation and selection of important biodiversity areas in regional conservation planning. We assessed variation in the rate of plant species turnover along and between environmental gradients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa using generalised dissimilarity modelling, in order to map landscape levels of floristic beta diversity. Our dataset consisted of 434 plots (1000 m(2)) containing 997 grassland and savanna matrix species. Our model explained 79 % of the null deviance observed in floristic dissimilarities. Variable rates of turnover existed along the major environmental gradients of mean annual temperature, median rainfall in February, and soil cation exchange capacity, as well as along gradients of geographical distance. Beta diversity was highest in relatively warm, drier summer regions and on dystrophic soils. Areas of high beta diversity identify areas that should be included in conservation plans to maximise representation of diversity and highlight areas best suited to protected area expansion. Biome transition areas in high beta diversity areas may be susceptible to climate variability. Including beta diversity turnover rates in regional conservation plans will help to preserve evolutionary and ecological processes that create and maintain diversity.

AB Animal body size and sex are requisite data for understanding population structure and demography. Little information exists regarding Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus, morphometrics, sex ratios of wild populations, sexual size dimorphism and standing crop biomass. We captured 322 C. niloticus at Lake St Lucia and Ndumo Game Reserve, South Africa, the two largest crocodile populations at the southern extent of the species' range in Africa, and measured a suite of physical characteristics to create predictive models of body length from other morphological attributes and body mass. Our sample included 118 hatchlings, 91 subadults and 113 adults. Strong positive allometric relationships were found between body length metrics (total length and snout-vent length) and other morphometrics. All morphometric regressions were linear, with the exception of the relationship of body length to body mass, which was logarithmic. Among relationships of cranial morphology and body length, we found considerable individual variation among all size classes. The mean head width-to-head length ratio was 1.9 +/- 1.6, and mean head length-to-total length ratio was 0.14 +/- 0.005. The sex ratios for non-hatchling individuals at both populations were essentially 1:1, but adult sex ratios were male biased. We calculated a total standing crop biomass of 96,867.18 kg (161.45 kg/km) and 52,640.40 kg (1504.01 kg/km) for C. niloticus at Lake St Lucia and Ndumo Game Reserve, respectively, and an estimated 3650 non-hatchling individuals for the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The data presented here will help inform crocodile management and population surveys in South Africa, where C. niloticus is an important apex predator that partitions aquatic resources and occasionally comes into conflict with human beings.

AB 1 Species of the aphid genus Eulachnus (Hemiptera, Aphididae), associated with pine trees, are an example of insects reported as rare over their native geographical range in Europe and serious pine pests far from their natural distribution. To predict the risk of invasion of spotted pine aphid Eulachnus agilis (Kaltenbach, 1843), green pine aphid Eulachnus brevipilosus Borner, 1940 and narrow brown pine aphid Eulachnus rileyi (Williams, 1911) on a global scale, ecological niche modelling was applied.
   2 We used the maximum entropy model, based on associations between unique occurrence localities and a set of environmental variables. We obtained models of potentially suitable habitats, based on climatic variables and distribution of host plants, suggesting that favourable conditions for each species may be present on every continent. However, E. agilis and E. rileyi appear to be potentially themost widespread species.
   3 In Europe, models showed that the potential distribution of the representatives of the genus Eulachnus overlapped with that of the host plants. In places where they have been introduced, these aphid species have readily adapted to indigenous or introduced pines, including trees grown commercially for timber.
   4 A jackknife test indicated that annual mean temperature and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important environmental variables restricting the expansion of the species under investigation. Moreover, the most important factor in the decrease in population density of the feeding aphids is the rainy season and, on a smaller scale, the presence of their natural enemies.

AB Increasing knowledge of post-release survival and habitat requirements of translocated animals is critical to improve success of conservation programs. We estimated survival of reintroduced captive-bred Asian houbara bustards (Chlamydotis macqueenii) in reserves of western United Arab Emirates where plantations exist as supplementary feeding sites. We explored factors influencing short- (3 months after release) and long-term (tri-monthly periods after third month of release) survival rates of released birds. We modeled life histories of individually tracked houbara using Program MARK. Mean short-term survival probability (0.76 +/- 0.14SD) was lower than mean long-term survival (0.86 +/- 0.03SD), and observed group size and the age of released birds positively correlated with short-term survival. We hypothesize that higher quality habitat (plantations) affected survival; larger groups occurred in plantations and older birds might be better able to maintain access to plantations. Long-term survival was negatively influenced by subsequent release events. Releasing more individuals increases local houbara density. This may lead to food depletion, increase in density-dependent mechanisms between individuals, or both. Short- and long-term survival rates suggest that food availability at the release sites, together with intraspecific interactions, may influence survival of newly released and established individuals. To improve the management of translocated animals, the impact of managed food resources should be quantified to assess how it might affect population vital rates. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB In order to identify concordant distributions of endemic vascular plants in the Monte desert, we analyzed the distributional data of 180 species endemic to the Monte desert with the optimality criterion implemented in the program VNDM. We detected 13 partially overlapping areas of vascular plant endemism. The main areas of endemism are distributed from north to south associated with the mountainous region of the Precordillera of the Andes towards the west of the study region. These main areas correspond to environments with important variation in elevation and aridity, whereas minor areas correspond to patches of the steppe vegetation towards the east of the study region. We also obtained extensive areas covering much of the Monte desert, coincident with the two classical biogeographic units proposed. In agreement with the general arid climate of the Monte, most of the endemic flora inhabits arid and/or semiarid environments.

AB With globalization in the last century, introduction of exotic plant species for commercial use has become more accessible. Such attempts may involve extreme land changes. We stress that domestication of native species should be preferred to the introduction of exotic species. We took the initial steps in domesticating several species by examining commercial uses and studying aspects of plant physiology. The following desert plants were considered: Bassia indica, for salt phytoremediation and for livestock feed; Commiphora gileadensis, as an agent against cancer cells; Artemisia sieberi and A. judaica, as plants with allopathic traits; Ficus palmate, as a stand for fig plantation; Balanites aegyptiaca, as a medicinal plant and for other uses; Portulaca oleracea and Scorzonera judaica, as food crops with added values; and Pistacia atlantica, as rootstock for P. vera.

AB Southern Africa boasts a wealth of endemic fauna and flora, comprising both massive recent radiations such as those characteristic of the Cape flora, and solitary ancient species such as the peculiar desert gymnosperm Welwitschia. This study was undertaken to identify ancient biological lineages (tetrapod and vascular plant lineages of Eocene age or older) endemic to southern Africa, and to map their distribution across the region. Twenty-seven (17 plant and ten animal) lineages were identified, and distribution maps were generated for each of them across 74 operational geographic units, which were then combined into total endemism and corrected weighted endemism per unit area. Total endemism peaked along South Africa's coast and Great Escarpment, but in the case of weighted endemism high values were also recorded along other portions of the Great Escarpment further north. A review of the lineages sister to southern African ancient endemic lineages showed that these are often globally widespread, and many of them differ substantially from the southern African ancient lineages in terms of morphology and ecology. The mechanisms of ancient lineage survival in the region are discussed, and their importance for conservation in southern Africa is emphasised.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of various grazing intensity levels on soil bulk density, soil pH, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil total organic carbon (TOC), aboveground biomass production, plant community richness (N), and vegetation diversity (H) in Gian Rangeland, Hamedan Province, Iran. Soil and vegetation samplings were conducted based on the randomized systematic method. Soil and vegetation samplings were carried out along 100-m-long transects placed at 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600m running perpendicular to six sheep corrals. The effects of various grazing intensities on studied parameters were detected by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (at =0.05). Results of this study indicated the soil bulk density, EC, TOC, aboveground biomass production, plant community richness, and vegetation diversity values were altered significantly at different distances from the sheep corrals. However, soil pH was not significantly affected by various grazing intensities.

AB Studies of habitat use by animals must consider behavioural resource requirements at different scales, which could influence the functional value of different sites. Using Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, we tested the hypotheses that behaviour affected use between and within habitats, hereafter referred to as macro-and microhabitats, respectively. We fitted GPS-enabled collars to fifteen buffalo and used the distances and turning angles between consecutive fixes to cluster the resulting data into resting, grazing, walking and relocating behaviours. Distance to water and six vegetation characteristic variables were recorded in sites used for each behaviour, except for relocating, which occurred too infrequently. We used multilevel binomial and multinomial logistic regressions to identify variables that characterised seasonally-preferred macrohabitats and microhabitats used for different behaviours. Our results showed that macrohabitat use was linked to behaviour, although this was least apparent during the rainy season, when resources were most abundant. Behaviour-related microhabitat use was less significant, but variation in forage characteristics could predict some behaviour within all macrohabitats. The variables predicting behaviour were not consistent, but resting and grazing sites were more readily identifiable than walking sites. These results highlight the significance of resting, as well as foraging, site availability in buffalo spatial processes. Our results emphasise the importance of considering several behaviours and scales in studies of habitat use to understand the links between environmental resources and animal behavioural and spatial ecology.

AB We observed an interspecies association between wild Javan lutungs (Trachypithecus auratus) and rusa deer (Rusa timorensis). In this association, the former drops plant items that the latter subsequently consumes (glean). We investigated whether the association is beneficial for deer that inhabit tropical regions characterized by drastic seasonal changes. Between 2011 and 2013, we conducted field surveys in the Pangandaran Nature Reserve, Indonesia. We observed 248 gleaning events; the total duration (60.1 h) of these gleaning events corresponded to approximately 4% of the lutung observation time. Deer consumed 39 items dropped by lutungs; these items belonged to 28 plant species and included leaves, fruits, and flowers. Gleaning events occurred more frequently during months when rainfall was low and few herbaceous plants grew in grassland patches. Gleaned foods were significantly heavier than non-gleaned foods. Our findings imply that the lutung-deer association is beneficial to deer, by improving nutritional condition during seasons with low food resources.

AB For Branchiopoda (Crustacea) and other taxa with resting egg banks, genetic differentiation among populations has been commonly observed at small geographic scales. This has been explained by a combination of priority effects and local adaptation. However, stochastic effects associated with hatching from resting egg banks may distort estimates of genetic differentiation. Herein we assessed the genetic composition and differentiation of subsequent active populations of two spinicaudatan species within a temporary water body in eastern Australia by sequencing mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and compared it to the differentiation among populations. Furthermore, a simulation was performed in which the genetic differentiation between active populations derived from resting egg banks of identical genetic composition was assessed. Genetic differentiation between subsequent active populations of the same water body was significant and of similar magnitude as among neighboring populations, all simulated active populations were significantly differentiated from each other. Stochastic effects associated with hatching from resting egg banks combined with genetic drift can lead to significantly differentiated active populations, even if the genetic composition of their resting egg banks was identical. As a consequence, genetic differentiation among populations may often be overestimated due to stochastic effects, which in turn may result in underestimations of gene flow.

AB Countryside landscapes are composed of a range of human-dominated ecosystems that now dominate the earth's terrestrial regions. In the tropics, the creation of these landscapes has shadowed the destruction of rainforests. Most studies of diversity across tropical countryside landscapes have focused on the taxonomic diversity of easily measured groups. Thus there are major gaps in our understanding of many ecologically important organisms in these landscapes. Here we examine the taxonomic and functional diversity of Diptera in countryside landscapes of Australia's wet tropics, focusing on some of the most common landscape elements in this region: forest remnants, forest edges, and open cattle pastures. We demonstrate that different landscape elements possess contrasting levels of dipteran diversity. Importantly, small forest fragments act as reservoirs of fly taxonomic diversity, but for some fly functional groups (pollinators and predators), small forest fragments and their edges have lower functional redundancy than larger forest patches and their edges. We also show that dipteran diversity is more positively associated with local forest cover than patch size alone. Our results complement the growing literature on ecologically important insect taxa in countryside landscapes around the world, and contribute to a greater understanding of how landscape modification likely impacts ecosystem functions and services at landscape scales.

AB Mangrove leaf litter, the dominant food of the detritivorous sesarmid crab Parasesarma erythodactyla, is highly deficient in nitrogen and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. We experimentally investigated potential contributions of the gut microbiota to the nutrition of P. erythodactyla by providing crabs with C-13- and N-15-labelled substrates that could lead to biosynthesis of key amino acids and fatty acids. Antibiotic treatment suppressed the gut microbiota of the crabs by reducing bacteria density to 9 and 52 % of those in the non-treated crabs in the amino acid and fatty acid experiments, respectively. Compound-specific isotopic analysis revealed significant C-13-enrichments in threonine (Thr), isoleucine (Ile), phenylalanine (Phe), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in crabs fed C-13-enriched glucose and palmitic acid, respectively, suggesting that these essential nutrients were de novo synthesized in the crab. Antibiotic treatment affected the incorporation of C-13-label to Thr, suggesting an involvement of the gut microbes in the biosynthesis of this amino acid. On the contrary, levels of C-13-enrichment in Ile, Phe, and DHA in crabs with intact and suppressed gut microbiota were comparable, suggesting that these compounds may be synthesized endogenously by the crab. Differences between crabs with and without an intact gut microbiota, however, may have been undetectable because of the high variability in C-13-enrichment of these compounds and the incomplete removal of gut micro-organisms in the antibiotic-treated crabs. Genetic and biochemical capacities enabling the gut microbes to de novo synthesize Ile, Phe, and DHA, therefore, need to be verified by additional approaches.

AB Positive interspecific interactions can shape fundamental wetland ecosystem dynamics, including energy transfer and spatial distribution of nutrients. Birds, by foraging in one location and nesting in another, commonly act as between-ecosystem nutrient vectors. However, the distribution of nutrients within nesting areas and mechanisms of transfer to other trophic levels are poorly understood. We report on measurements of available food transferred from nesting long-legged wading birds to American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in the Everglades of Florida, USA. Using throughfall traps, a historic dataset on nesting success and a literature-parameterized alligator energy budget, we estimated the potential food available to alligators via regurgitant and nestling carcasses, and compared that to alligator food requirements. Although dropped regurgitant is of little importance to scavenging alligators, we estimate that nestling carcasses throughout the ecosystem could support the energetic requirements of hundreds of alligators for periods of several months. This resource occurs during the dry season, when alligator thermoregulatory opportunities are relatively scarce and female alligators are mobilizing resources for egg-laying. Our results indicate that through fallen nestlings, wading bird nesting colonies have strong potential to benefit alligators. This facilitative exchange may be globally widespread, forming a keystone process in many tropical and subtropical wetlands.

AB Recurrent tree defoliation by pastoralists, akin to herbivory, can negatively affect plant reproduction and population dynamics. However, our understanding of the indirect role of defoliation in seedling recruitment and tree-grass dynamics in tropical savanna is limited. In West African savanna, Fulani pastoralists frequently defoliate several fodder tree species to feed livestock in the dry season. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of recurrent defoliation of African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) by Fulani people on seedling (<2 cm basal diameter) and sapling dynamics in West Africa using four years of demographic data on seedling and sapling density, growth, and survival, coupled with fruit production and microhabitat data over the same time period. Tree canopy cover facilitated seedlings but had negative effects on sapling growth possibly via intraspecific competition with adult plants. Interspecific competition with grasses strongly reduced seedling survival but had a weak effect on sapling growth. Fire reduced seedling survival and weakly reduced growth of seedlings and saplings, but did not affect sapling survival. These results indicate that the effect of fire on seedlings and saplings is distinct, a mechanism suitable for an episodic recruitment of seedlings into the sapling stage and consistent with predictions from the demographic bottleneck model. Defoliation affected seedling density and sapling growth through changes in canopy cover, but had no effect on seedling growth and sapling survival. In the moist region, sapling density was higher in sites with low-intensity defoliation, indicating that defoliation may strengthen the tree recruitment bottleneck. Our study suggests that large-scale defoliation can alter the facilitative role of nurse trees on seedling dynamics and tree-sapling competition. Given that tree defoliation by local people is a widespread activity throughout savanna-forest systems in West Africa, it has the potential to affect tree-grass coexistence. Incorporating the influence of large tree defoliation into existing models of savanna dynamics can further our understanding of tree-grass coexistence and improve management. A rotating harvest system, which allows seedlings to recruit episodically, or a patchwork harvest, which maintains some nursery trees in the mosaic, could help sustain seedling recruitment and minimize the indirect effects of harvest.

AB Malladas de El Saler is a mosaic of dune slacks scattered along a coastal sand bar in the Mediterranean region. Active populations of the fairy shrimp T. stagnalis are exclusively present in one of these ponds. We combined field observations and laboratory experiments to find the ecological requirements of T. stagnalis that determine this habitat exclusiveness and the possibility of future establishment in nearby ponds. Conductivity revealed as a determinant ecological constraint. In the field, the species was restricted to conductivity levels below 1.28 mS cm(-1) and in experimental microcosms, hatchability, survival and reproductive potential were detrimental from 2.9 mS cm(-1). The observation of life history characteristics from the experimental individuals confirmed the importance of the unpredictable character of Mediterranean temporary ponds in shaping life history strategies, as they hatched early, matured rapidly and produced a high number of cysts. We discuss the essential steps during colonization that may explain the presence or absence in our ponds, and revealed a harsh future for the species if the current conditions of habitat deterioration persist. We suggest several conservation measures, including a cyst bank storage or/and adult translocations to nearby suitable ponds. These measures will ensure (1) the preservation of genetic diversity and (2) healthy metapopulation dynamics with recolonization rates compensating for local extinctions.

AB Offspring transmit signals to parents to communicate their resource demands. Parents interpret these signals and should adjust provisioning efforts to meet offspring demands but only to the point at which the benefits of enhanced offspring quality stops exceeding the increased costs to future reproduction. We investigated both proximate behavioral mechanisms in these interactions and ultimatelevel decisions for total parental investment in streaked shearwaters Calonectris leucomelas by recording begging calls, monitoring parental attendance, and altering states of chicks by supplementing food. In our study, chicks seemed to honestly communicate satiety and body condition via begging. The parents, however, did not downwardly adjust feeding rates, meal sizes delivered to chicks, and total investment in nests in which chicks were regularly supplementary-fed partial meals. But on nights when both parents visited the nest, the second-arriving parents recognized that chicks had already received a full meal because they reduced the food they gave to chicks and also lengthened their subsequent foraging trip. Our findings therefore suggest that although chick begging appeared to reflect need, parents only responded to variation in begging that indicated that chicks had already received a full meal. In a simulation, we show that this strategy prevents parents from exceeding the optimal amount of parental investment. Their insensitivity to slightly reduced begging after partial meals caused them to exceed optimal investment in supplementary-fed nests, suggesting that parental investment is largely regulated by responses to feeding rate of the other parent rather than being fine-tuned to cues about body condition of chicks.

AB Southern Africa is recognized as one of the world's diversity hotspots for large branchiopod crustaceans. Nonetheless, many areas including large parts of Zimbabwe remain poorly studied. We report on the diversity of anostracans and notostracans in a tropical and geologically diverse savannah area in SE Zimbabwe. We explored the links between geology, hydroperiod and diversity and distribution patterns of anostracans and notostracans. In a large survey, 160 temporary clay pans distributed over the four major and diverse geological regions were sampled every fortnight. Seven fairy shrimp and one tadpole shrimp species were recorded. Although the study area is characterized by substantial variation in soil geology, we did not find strong effects of geology on the composition of anostracan and notostracan assemblages in pools of different sizes and hydrology. All species occurred in all four geological regions but the abundance of pools without large branchiopods differed between the four investigated regions.

AB This article analyses the life and ideas of Margaret Rutherford Levyns (nee Michell), a South African botanist who worked from 1918 to 1946 as a lecturer in botany at the University of Cape Town and continued to write about the Cape flora (known today as the Cape Floristic Region) until her death in 1975. Until the early 1960s, Levyns maintained a neutral scientific and moral understanding of invasive species, defined here as ecological liberalism', that reflected her gendered experiences as a botanist, her prevailing ideas of ecology, the lingering ideals of Cape liberalism, and her extensive research into the phytogeography and taxonomy of the Cape flora. Levyns began to shift her views on non-native invasive species only after retirement. By using Levyns as a lens onto the period, this article distinguishes between a prevailing Cape ecological liberalism from the 1890s to the 1950s that shifted towards a more critical stance on invasive alien species in the 1950s and 1960s.

AB Intensified forestry increases the interest in replacing native tree species with fast growing nonnative species. However, consequences for native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are poorly understood. We compared cover and composition of major functional groups of ground vegetation between planted stands of non-native Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm. and native conifers Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. in northern boreal Sweden. We quantified the ground cover of lichens, bryophytes, vascular plants and ground without vegetation (bare ground) in 96 stands covering three different age classes (15, 30 and 85 years old). Our study revealed differences in ground vegetation patterns between non-native and native managed forests, and that these differences are linked to stand age and differences in canopy cover. Total vascular plant cover increased with increasing stand age for all tree species, with P. contorta stands having higher cover than both native conifers. The ground cover of lichens was, although generally low, highest in stands of Pinus sylvestris. P. abies stands had a lower cover of vascular plants, but bare ground was more common compared with P. contorta. Our results suggest that the use of P. contorta as an alternative tree species in Fennoscandian forestry will influence native ground vegetation patterns. This influence is likely to change with time and future research should consider both temporal and landscape-scale effects from shifting tree-species dominance to Pinus contorta and other non-native tree species.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the surface flux of crustacean larvae at three points along the Baker/Martinez fjord complex, Chilean Patagonia, during the season of maximum river discharge. Concurrent acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and zooplankton surveys were conducted along three across-channel transects spanning 58 km along the fjord, in late February 2013. The results revealed a two-layer structure in along-channel residual velocity within the upper 25 m of the water column, which resembled a typical estuarine circulation pattern. Near the river mouth, transverse asymmetries in along-fjord flows and secondary circulation were found, which may substantially affect local patterns of larval transport and/or retention. Barnacle nauplii were more abundant during flood (15.2 +/- 8.8 indiv m(-3), mean +/- standard error) than during ebb tide (3.36 +/- 0.95 indiv m(-3)), suggesting they are tidally transported. Since the along-channel transport of vertically migrating larvae depends on the instantaneous flow fields to which they are exposed, larval abundance data were combined with velocity fields obtained from individual ADCP passes to produce instantaneous larval flux estimates. Near the Baker river mouth, net flux estimates showed that barnacle nauplii (cyprids) are advected landward (seaward), whereas zoeae of the squat lobster Munida gregaria are exported from the fjord. These results are consistent with previous findings and illustrate how the composition and distribution of meroplankton may reflect along-fjord changes in estuarine circulation, driven mostly by seasonal changes in freshwater inputs, as well as small-scale spatial variations in flow along the fjord.

AB Whether invasion of introduced plant species may be aided by certain community properties is poorly understood for species-rich ecosystems, such as tropical montane forests. In Kenya, the non-native tree Fraxinus pennsylvanica has invaded degraded montane forests. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the relative importance of different community properties to Fraxinus invasion after agricultural abandonment and in the secondary forest. Fraxinus invasion was positively related to plant community species diversity and the abundance of tree saplings, shrubs, ferns, and herbs in the abandoned fallows, but negatively related to the same community properties in the secondary forest. The number of Fraxinus recruits declined with declining propagule pressure in the fallows, but not in the secondary forest. Although adult and saplings of Fraxinus were positively related to community diversity in the fallows, Fraxinus appeared to decrease diversity in the secondary forest. These results show that the success of non-native species invasion and the effects of an invader on the resident community may depend both on properties and degree of disturbance of the community. Plant community diversity and evenness appeared to determine the invasion success by increasing invasibility of the abandoned fallows, but decreasing invasibility of the secondary forest. Our results from a tropical degraded forest emphasize the importance of including habitat characteristics when predicting both the potential of non-native plant invasion and effects of invasives on the particular community.

AB Transgenic crops expressing toxin proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been deployed on a large scale for management of Helicoverpa armigera. Resistance to Bt toxins has been documented in several papers, and therefore, we examined the role of midgut microflora of H. armigera in its susceptibility to Bt toxins. The susceptibility of H. armigera to Bt toxin Cry1Ac was assessed using Log-dose-Probit analysis, and the microbial communities were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. The H. armigera populations from nine locations harbored diverse microbial communities, and had some unique bacteria, suggesting a wide geographical variation in microbial community in the midgut of the pod borer larvae. Phylotypes belonging to 32 genera were identified in the H. armigera midgut in field populations from nine locations. Bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae (Order Bacillales) were present in all the populations, and these may be the common members of the H. armigera larval midgut microflora. Presence and/or absence of certain species were linked to H. armigera susceptibility to Bt toxins, but there were no clear trends across locations. Variation in susceptibility of F-1 neonates of H. armigera from different locations to the Bt toxin Cry1Ac was found to be 3.4-fold. These findings support the idea that insect migut microflora may influence the biological activity of Bt toxins.

AB Climate change is considered a top threat to biodiversity, but the relative roles of contemporary climate versus the rate of climate change in determining spatial patterns of biodiversity are far from clear. China has a very diverse flora and harbors a high percentage of endemic species, but the mechanisms underlying spatial patterns of plant endemism are poorly understood. This study explores the geographical patterns of a representative sample of 555 endemic seed plant species at the scale of 0.5A degrees latitude x 0.5A degrees longitude. Ordinary least squares and spatial autoregressive models were compared to assess the relationship between richness of endemics and the rate of climate change in the past century, as well as a group of contemporary climate variables. In China, a high level of endemism was associated with high elevation and low rate of climate change. However, contemporary climate had a stronger impact than climate change velocity in the past century on endemic species richness patterns. Specifically, mean annual precipitation and annual range of temperature were important contemporary climatic factors. The rate of change of annual mean temperature, but not that of annual precipitation, also significantly contributed to the spatial pattern of plant endemic species richness. We found no significant relationship between topographic variation and endemic species richness, while temperature variability at multiple time scales was strongly correlated with the species richness pattern. Future work should consider the direction of climate change and incorporate higher-resolution data.

AB Mesozooplankton provide oxic and anoxic microhabitats for associated bacteria, whose carbon substrate usage activities complement those of the ambient bacteria. The metabolic profiles of bacterial communities associated with the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were examined in comparison with phytoplankton-associated bacteria. Carbon substrate usage by phytoplankton-associated bacteria was significantly different than that of copepod-associated bacteria in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Substrate utilization by copepod-associated bacteria was more dependent upon oxygen condition than whether the bacteria were located on the copepod exoskeleton or within the gut. Results suggest that gut bacteria were responsible for a large portion of anaerobic substrate usage by copepod-associated bacteria. The metabolic profiles of bacteria associated with six common zooplankton groups and free-living bacteria collected in July 2012 from the York River estuary, Virginia, (37A degrees 14'50.36aEuro(3)N, 76A degrees 29'58.03W) were also compared, and there were significant differences in their substrate utilization patterns between aerobic and anaerobic incubations, and among the different zooplankton groups. Through trophic interactions, phytoplankton-associated or free-living bacteria may be introduced to the anoxic zooplankton gut and its associated bacterial community. Inclusion of these anaerobic microenvironments and their microbial inhabitants increased the total number of substrates used by 57 % over what was used by aerobic phytoplankton-associated bacteria alone, and by 50 % over what was used by aerobic free-living bacteria in the York River. Therefore, the presence of zooplankton-associated microhabitats and their bacteria expanded the functionality of aquatic microbial communities and led to a more comprehensive substrate usage.

TI Fire and grazing modify grass community response to environmental

AB Tropical dry forests and savannas are important repositories of plant diversity and ecosystem services in the tropics. These ecosystems are also used extensively for grazing by livestock, and represent a critical element of the rural economy of many tropical countries. Fire is considered as a part of co-evolution in these ecosystems across the globe. However, in recent decades, there has been a shift in historical fire regime. Fire has become more frequent in these landscapes, and could be further enhanced under climate change. This poses threats to existing biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and rural economy. We asked how variability in fire frequency has influenced diversity and heterogeneity in grass species composition, and richness and abundance of grass species preferred by large herbivores (referred to as grazing acceptability) in a South Indian tropical savanna forest. We assumed that an increase in fire frequency acts as the active constraint and limits an ecosystem from attaining the maximum heterogeneity, and the maximum grazing acceptability (maximum richness and abundance of grass species preferred by herbivores) in its native settings. We used MODIS active fire and burned area products to estimate fire frequency across the landscape. A nested sampling approach was used to collect information on vegetation and soil at different fire frequencies. Quantile regression analyses indicated that diversity and heterogeneity in grass species composition as well a's grazing acceptability decreased with increasing fire frequencies. We found that livestock grazing intervened with the observed vegetation patterns; grass species diversity and heterogeneity, and grazing acceptability increased with grazing intensity at lower quantiles. Other measured covariates, rainfall, and soil-fertility, alone were not able to explain the observed vegetation patterns in the landscape. The results show a need to control annual fires but allow and manage intermittent fires in this landscape. A complete suppression of fire is not desirable as fire releases nutrients from burning of deeper-rooted vegetation and thus acts as a periodic nutrient pump. It also played an important role in maintaining the grass cover by reducing shrub cover. Hence, it is important to consider the complex interactions between fires-grazers-soil-vegetation to develop effective management practices. We conclude that fire frequency should be managed at low to intermediate levels (one fire in every 5-9 years, resembling the native settings), and grazing regulated, in order to sustain wild and domestic herbivores, biodiversity, and other key ecosystem processes and services over the long-term.

AB Hydrophobic organic contaminants readily partition from aqueous to organic phases in aquatic systems with past research largely focusing on sediment. However, within many aquatic systems, matrices such as leaf material and detritus are abundant and ecologically important, as they may represent a primary exposure route for aquatic invertebrates. The objectives of the present study were to examine partitioning and toxicity to Hyalella azteca among permethrin and p,p'-DDT contaminated sediment, leaf, and a sediment-leaf mixture. Log organic carbon-water partitioning coefficients ranged from 4.21 to 5.82 for both insecticides, and were greatest within sediment and lowest in coarse leaf material. H. azteca lethal concentrations for 50% of the population (LC50s) ranged from 0.5 to 111 mu g g(-1) organic carbon, and were dependent on the matrix composition. The variation in sorption and toxicity among matrices common within stream ecosystems suggests that the ecological niche of aquatic organisms may be important for estimating risk of hydrophobic pesticides.

AB Zooplankton support distinct bacterial communities in high concentrations relative to the surrounding water, but little is known about how the compositions and functionalities of these bacterial communities change through time in relation to environmental conditions. We conducted a year-long field study of bacterial communities associated with common zooplankton groups as well as free-living bacterial communities in the York River, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay. Bacterial community genetic fingerprints and their carbon substrate usage were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified 16S rDNA and by Biolog EcoPlates, respectively. Zooplankton-associated communities were genetically distinct from free-living bacterial communities but utilized a similar array of carbon substrates. On average, bacteria associated with different zooplankton groups were genetically more similar to each other within each month (65.4% similarity) than to bacterial communities of the same zooplankton group from different months (28 to 30% similarity), which suggests the importance of ambient environmental conditions in shaping resident zooplankton-associated bacterial communities. Monthly changes in carbon substrate utilization were less variable for zooplankton-associated bacteria than for free-living bacteria, suggesting that the zooplankton microhabitat is more stable than the surrounding water and supports specific bacterial groups in the otherwise unfavorable conditions in the water column.

AB The ingression of woody plants into savannas, known as bush or shrub encroachment, has become a global concern. Fire has been acknowledged as a key factor in managing woody vegetation in savannas. This study assessed the role of fire in determining the total density, structure and composition of woody vegetation in Ithala Game Reserve, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed woody vegetation in comparable areas with different fire frequencies. In Combretum-dominated woodlands, there was no significant effect of fire frequency on the total density of woody individuals. In old field grasslands, the density of woody plants was greater in areas burnt annually and in areas burnt once every 10 years, compared to areas burnt once every 2-4 years. In these grasslands, areas burnt annually were dominated by woody plants <2 m in height. Herbivore and fire interactions may explain these results. Multivariate analyses also indicated a significant effect of fire frequency on woody vegetation composition. To control dominant encroaching trees such as Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia karroo (Vachellia karroo), and the development of macrophyllous thickets, an intermediate fire frequency is required (one burn every 2-4 years).

AB Rural communities in the developing world contexts are heavily reliant on the environment for their livelihoods, often resulting in reduction in forest and woodland tree cover and species diversity. This article provides indicative data at two threatened tropical forest and woodland sites in northeastern South Africa. Woody individuals and species were quantified at 1-ha sample plots both close to and away from adjacent villages, and the data analyzed using Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Surprisingly, for a developing world context, results suggest that the forests are in a good state of conservation. Management factors likely to be responsible are discussed.

AB The spread of species far from their native range is an important component of global changes. Investigating the ability of alien plants to invade different habitats is one of the most important approaches in the analysis of biological invasion mechanisms.
   The study was based on floristic research carried out in 1998-2002 in the north-western part of Poland. The habitats sampled were classified according to the EUNIS classification. A dataset of 2638 naturalized neophyte records was compiled based on a total of 2132 floristic lists. Species entries were supplemented with data on taxonomic position (family), origin, frequency, life form and number of habitats a particular species colonises. Ordination analyses showed the level of disturbance in individual habitats to be important in species-habitats relationships. Some of the species (e.g. Chamomilla suaveolens, Galinsoga parviflora, Veronica persica) occurred mainly in man-made, heavily disturbed habitats, while others (e.g. Impatiens parviflora, Padus serotina, Quercus rubra) were present primarily in natural habitats, less affected by humans. The species with the broadest habitat ranges identified included, i.a. Conyza canadensis, Impatiens parviflora, Epilobium ciliatum, and Oxalis fontana. Most of them, however, had different "core" habitats. Some species, e.g. Juncus tenuis, Elodea canadensis, Veronica persica were associated with one or a few habitats. The ability of species to invade numerous habitat types did not depend on their invasive status. The most successful aliens are those which spread dynamically along forest paths as well as those penetrating forest communities. The phytocoenotic role of each naturalized neophyte in plant communities requires a detailed study.
   Each individual habitat supports well-established alien species whose traits fit its characteristics and the disturbance intensity. Analysis of alien species traits, local distribution, habitat preferences and range makes it possible to reliably assess potentially successful invaders.

AB In European countries, the coasts are areas with high population density, intensive use of marine and terrestrial resources, and rapid urbanization. Coastal development creates conflicts and further ones are expected through climate change and sea level rise. In this article, the aim is knowledge synthesis for conflict research to support strategies for sustainable coastal zone management. For that purpose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework is elaborated and applied in exemplary conflict analyses. The framework combines knowledge from different fields of environmental and conflict research. In an analysis of 26 local, non-violent resource use conflicts in the Swedish metropolitan coastal areas of Gothenburg and Malmo, the themes of coastal landscape changes, resource management, and conflict analysis are connected in a governance perspective. The data were collected through qualitative, semi-structured interviews and discussions with local stakeholders and experts, document analysis and analysis of articles from local newspapers. The conflict analysis showed the multi-faceted and complex nature of the conflicts. Solutions require interdisciplinary research and knowledge synthesis. Our conclusions relate to the requirements of further development of knowledge integration and approaches to multi-scale environmental governance.

AB Effect of stocking density was studied in three abalone species Haliotis discus discus (HDD), H. gigantea (HG), and H. madaka (HM) and their hybrids [HDD x HM, HM x HG and HG x HM, mother first] by rearing individually marked abalones for 217 days at low (22 % of available surface area; LD), medium (53 %; MD), and high (126 %; HD) densities. Feeding rate (FR) and feed conversion rate were observed by measuring the amount of feed ingested at an interval of 2-3 days. Reduction of growth rate with the increment of density was found in all three species [Specific growth rate in weight (G (W) ) HDD, LD: 0.121, MD: 0.093, HD: 0.069; HM: 0.12, 0.082, 0.061; HG: 0.254, 0.222, and 0.131] and the hybrids HDD x HM (0.18, 0.109, 0.108). The medium density produced the highest growth rates in HM x HG and HG x HM hybrids (0.284, 0.342, 0.28). A growth spurt was observed in all three species and hybrids in the last 44 days of rearing. FR varied from 0.72 to 7.97 % body weight and decreased with the increase in density in all species and hybrids. The results indicate differences in density thresholds for the three abalone species and their hybrids suggesting requirement of different aquaculture management strategies for them.

AB Panbiogeography represents the spatial congruence among species distributions by means of generalized tracks. Some critics have suggested the method fails to objectively evaluate congruence, being neither repeatable nor falsifiable. The MartiTracks software was proposed to address spatial congruence using geometric properties as a counterpoint to the manual procedures so far employed in generalized track obtainment. To evaluate whether MartiTracks is a reliable alternative to the congruence problem in the quantitative panbiogeographic approach, we tested the software parameters with three analysis schemes under two real datasets. Then, we proceeded to a comparison of the results to those produced from Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) and Clique Analysis, two quantitative methods which are based in predefined biogeographic areas or in the employment of grid cells. For PAE we used both analytical units, while Clique Analysis was restricted to grid cells. Through this, we aimed to comparatively evaluate the criteria of spatial congruence in different approaches. For each dataset and method, significantly different tracks resulted, highlighting the disparate congruence criteria among panbiogeographic approaches. Despite PAE ending up as the most reliable of the tools tested, it is still far from solving panbiogeographic congruence. The main focus of this paper, MartiTracks, is indeed a tool that makes minimum spanning tree construction a repeatable and easy-to-visualize process, but stumbles upon its obscure procedures of generalized track obtainment, congruence criteria, subjective parameter definition, the unclear implications of employing said parameters, and dubious results. Our results suggest that the subjectivity of the parameter setup process substantially influences the results, biasing them to the user-desired level of congruence. That the software produces fast and easy-to-visualize results does not make it a definitive solution to the problem of quantitative panbiogeographic approaches.

AB Monthly stem increment of 766 trees was assessed for 7 years in Kakamega Forest, Kenya and related to monthly climatic variables. Mean stem increment of all tree individuals correlated negatively with maximum temperature but not with mean and minimum temperatures. For the precipitation variables sum of precipitation and number of rainy days we found positive correlations. Stem increment of the trees in the early-, mid-, and late-successional groups correlated positively with the number of rainy days. For late-successional trees increment correlated negatively with mean and maximum temperature and positively with all other precipitation variables. For mid-successional trees we found a negative correlation with mean temperature. In addition, the stem increment of most species related positively to precipitation variables and negatively to mean and maximum temperature. In view of the expected increasing temperatures and fewer but heavier rain events, our results suggest that climate change will lead to a reduction in stem increment. The results appertaining to the successional groups imply that early and mid-successional species are better equipped to perform well under the expected future climatic conditions than the late-successional species. This could reduce the role of this East African forest as a carbon store. As the responses to climatic variables were highly group- and species-specific it is likely that climate change will result in a species composition shift, presumably in favour of drought-resistant and heat-tolerating species.

AB Most grassland communities in agricultural landscapes comprise a mix of exotic and native plants, where grasses and forbs are disposed in low diversity patches conforming a heterogeneous matrix of vegetation. Within these "novel" ecosystems, woody encroachment is one of the principal causes of ecosystem degradation. Here, we examined the resistance to exotic woody establishment (Gleditsia triacanthos) into four different monospecific patches characteristics of old-field grasslands in Inland Pampa: an annual forb (Conium maculatum), an annual grass (Lolium multiflorum), and two perennial grasses (Cynodon dactylon and Festuca arundinacea). We evaluated the filter to tree recruitment by rodent seed removal and survival and growth of Gleditsia seedlings transplanted into undisturbed and disturbed microsites, within each patch. Beneath intact vegetation seed removal was an important biotic filter to woody establishment whereas disturbances facilitated seed survival in patches of perennial grasses. Patch identity affected tree growth, and Cynodon reduced the final biomass compared to forbs. Disturbance enhanced tree performance independently of patch type. After 2 years, tree survival was independent of disturbance and patch identity. As patch identity may regulate granivory and growth of tree saplings, community susceptibility or resistance to woody invasion rather than representing a static community attribute could vary according to the dynamic changes in the proportion of susceptible-resistant patches. Broadly, our work reinforces the concept that mechanisms regulating vegetation heterogeneity add a component of stochasticity to biotic resistance to community plant invasion.

AB Habitat fragmentation disrupts species movement, leading to local extinctions and altered community structure. Habitat corridors, which connect isolated patches of habitat and facilitate movement between patches, provide a potential solution to these negative impacts. However, most studies to date have examined the movement of species alone without considering emergent effects on the community (e. g., altered trophic structure). We use large-scale, experimental landscapes and nitrogen stable isotopes ratios (delta N-15) of a common generalist consumer (the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta) to determine how corridors affect trophic structure. Thus, because the fire ant is a species whose trophic position is flexible and whose diet typically reflects local prey availability, we assume that shifts in fire ants' trophic position between connected and isolated patches are likely to reflect shifts in patch trophic structure. We found that colonies in isolated patches had lower means and ranges of delta N-15 than colonies in otherwise similar connected patches, suggesting that corridors may increase fire ants' trophic position and breadth, respectively. Previous work in our landscapes documented higher species richness of plants in connected than unconnected patches. Patch means of ant delta N-15 were positively correlated with plant richness, suggesting that increased plant richness may influence the observed responses in fire ant delta N-15. Together these results suggest that fragmentation may reduce trophic position and narrow trophic breadth of dietary generalists such as the fire ant. These shifts likely reflect an alteration of food webs in isolated patches. Our results suggest that corridors may be effective in preventing or reducing such alterations.

AB Our understanding of carbon (C) dynamics within savannas is very limited, especially how source/sink dynamics are influenced by the resident biota. Previous measurements of epigeal termite mounds (termitaria), ubiquitous in many savannas, have shown that they are considerable point sources of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), whereas CO2 measurements collected outside the mounds were generally assumed to be independent of termite activity. However, no measurements were conducted along gradients away from the mounds to confirm this. We quantified daytime soil CO2 emissions (soil respiration) along gradients from the center to 20 m from the mound edge in Serengeti National Park, and measured soil temperature/moisture, macro-invertebrate abundance, and vegetation height as variables potentially influencing these emissions. Further, we quantified how far into the savanna termitaria impact CO2 emissions. As in other studies, we found the highest soil CO2 fluxes at the termitaria-center and considerably lower fluxes in the surrounding savanna. Macro-invertebrate abundance was associated with the differences in emissions measured, whereas the other variables were not. The analysis of spatial autocorrelation revealed significantly lower fluxes between the termitaria edge and up to 9 m from the edge compared to the values measured at the termitaria-center and between 10 and 20 m from the termitaria edge. When extrapolating the emissions across the landscape our results suggest that the lower CO2 emissions found between the edge and 9 m fully compensate for the high fluxes measured at the termitaria center. Consequently, our findings provide evidence that termitaria might influence the savanna C source-sink dynamics differently than previously thought.

AB Few studies have recorded the spectral signatures of domesticated live animals and in particular few have examined wild species. Using in situ radiometry, we acquired visual and near infrared spectral signatures of wild elk (Cervus elaphus) and domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) and horses (Equus caballus). Signatures were significantly different among species across all bands with the exception of cattle and horses in the red band. Further research is needed to determine if the shallower slopes in the red-shift region of the animal signatures would allow for distinction from vegetation using various remote sensors. Application of in situ spectral signatures to remotely sensed imagery could provide an efficient method for counting wildlife.

AB Many plant communities are recruitment limited, which may occur because there are either too few seeds to fill available microsites, too few available microsites, or both. In a recruitment-limited, Minnesota, USA old field, we tested among these alternatives in a three-phase study. In phase 1, we estimated the production of late-successional forb and C4 grass seeds. In phase 2, we experimentally modified field establishment conditions with rainfall amendment, adult plant thinning, litter reduction, and small mammal exclusion. We then measured recruitment. On average, of the nearly 2,600 seeds produced m(-2), only 164 seeds m(-2) were present and living after overwintering, as measured by field and greenhouse germination. Furthermore, on average, only 9 of those 164 seeds m(-2) germinated in the field, even under the relaxed establishment conditions of our four experimental treatments. Although adults of C4 grasses dominate the field, surprisingly few C4 grass seedlings germinated. To understand why, in phase 3, we added seed of the three dominant C4 grasses into the same plots the following year. Their ability to recruit into control plots compared with treated plots was relatively lower than for the ambiently recruited forbs from phase 2, suggesting that the competitively dominant C4 grasses have greater difficulty establishing in the extant community. Of the seeds that did germinate in the field in phases 2 and 3, all four experimental treatments significantly improved at least one stage of establishment, with the rainfall amendment having the greatest overall effect across species. In total, our results suggest that seed limitation was exacerbated by microsite limitation via multiple mechanisms.

AB We analysed structural differences between midgut epithelial cells of fed instar antlions' larvae Euroleon nostras and starved ones. In starved larvae the presence of autophagolysosome-like structures was observed, which are characteristic structures associated with autophagy. The results presented here provide insight supporting the role of autophagy as a cell survival mechanism for the periods of food deprivation. Additional structural changes in the cytoplasm were seen in the spherites. The ultrastructure and chemical composition of spherites in the midgut epithelial cells of first, second and third instar larvae were observed with light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A detailed characterization of the elemental composition of the spherites was studied using analytical electron microscopy; a combination of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy filtering TEM (EFTEM) was applied. The structure and elemental composition of the spherites changed during the period of larval life. Moreover, changes in chemical composition were found between spherites from fed and starved E. nostras. In fed first instar larvae, the spherites contained an organic matrix, composed of C, N and O. In this matrix, P. Cl, Ca and Fe were detected. In starved first instar larvae, only C, N and P were present. The spherites of fed second instar larvae were rich in organic and inorganic elements and were composed of C, N, O, Na, Mg, P. S, Cl, K, Ca, Mn, Fe and Zn. In starved second instar larvae, the chemical elements N, O, P. Ca and Fe were found. In fed third instar larvae, the spherites contained C, N, O, Na, Mg, P, Cl, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co and Zn. In starved third larvae, C. O, Si, Ca, and Fe were detected. Generally, the spherites are exploited in starved larvae. These results suggest that the elemental supply of spherites may provide crucial support for physiological processes during starvation periods amongst E. nostras instar larvae. In some cases in fed second and fed third instar larvae, spherites were seen in the lumen of the midgut. Such spherites could serve as reservoirs for nontoxic waste material that cannot be metabolized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Theory predicts that not all plant species will be equally affected by disruption to their pollinator mutualisms because traits such as breeding system and mutualism strength can affect their response. We investigated these traits in three species of Afromontane mistletoe Globimetula braunii, Agelanthus brunneus and A. djurensis in Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve, Nigeria, to test whether the traits were reliable indicators of relative reproductive success and could be used to predict relative vulnerability to pollinator loss. For each mistletoe species, insect and bird visitors were identified during a 160-240-min observation period of 4-10 plants and their roles in flower opening and fruit set were investigated using exclusion experiments applied to 250-500 flowers. We found that all three mistletoes are self-compatible but not capable of autonomous self-fertilization. The pollinator assemblage comprised four species of sunbird (Cyanomitris spp., Cinnyris spp.) and a small social wasp (Vespinae). None of the mistletoes requires birds for flower opening: G. braunii flowers self-opened in the absence of pollinators, whereas insects opened both Agelanthus spp. Irrespective of flower opening, each mistletoe species requires sunbirds for effective pollination and fruit set. Only G. braunii demonstrated pollen limitation (pollen limitation index = 0.504) which may be an early indication of mutualism breakdown. We suggest that mistletoes be considered as indicators of habitat condition and functioning within Afromontane forest ecosystems.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; PROPERTY; ACCESS
AB The forest industry is a significant contributor to the development of roads and most are constructed on Aboriginal territories. Many Aboriginal communities are isolated both socially and economically and Aboriginal cultures are often described as having inherent socio-environmental relationships. Aboriginal communities, therefore, may be the most likely to benefit and be most vulnerable to the impacts of road development. We use a case study approach to explore how an Aboriginal community interprets and responds to the increasing development of roads in its territory. The results are interpreted using the theory of access in order to frame the interactions between people and nature within a cohesive system which includes elements which are spatially located, flow, interact, and can be disturbed. The dominant themes discussed as being affected by the influence of roads on access included issues of the following nature: Aboriginal, hunting, foreign, territorial and environmental. Issues pertaining to Aboriginal actors as opposed to foreign actors such as the industry or non-aboriginal hunters and fishers dominated discussions. Although the positive effects provided by roads were alluded to, focus tended towards the affected relationships and ties between the territory, the environment and Aboriginal members. Roads are associated with changes in traditional roles and practices which benefit individualistic behaviors. The access mechanisms mediating and controlling the use of resources through traditional norms and roles such as sharing, asking permission, and helping in the practice of traditional activities no longer apply effectively. Changes in the traditional spatial organization of the territory have minimized the influence of knowledge, identity, and negotiation in mediating access among communities. Results highlight that conflicts have thus resulted between and among Aboriginal communities. Also, perception of the role of the environment and ways in which traditional practices occur has altered important socio-environmental dynamics which are part of Aboriginal culture.

AB Fish were surveyed by visual census on offshore reefs in Mozambique and eastern South Africa to compare (a) fully-protected 'sanctuary' areas, (b) 'partly protected' areas where recreational diving and limited fishing are permitted, and (c) 'open' unprotected areas. Community composition differed between coral-dominated reefs and those covered mainly by algae and sponges, but not among treatments. Larger size classes were significantly diminished in unprotected areas compared to protected and sanctuary zones. Within coral-dominated reefs, abundances of indicator taxa showed three patterns: (1) greatest abundance in sanctuaries, intermediate in partly protected and least in open areas; (2) greatest abundance in sanctuaries but equal diminishment in partly protected and open areas; and (3) greater depletion in partly protected than either sanctuary or open areas. We conclude that partial protection does not effectively conserve reef fish, and there are indications that partly protected areas concentrate fishing effort on 'pelagic' gamefish. Sanctioned shore-angling and offshore 'gamefishing', illegal fishing and diver disturbance may collectively undermine the efficacy of partially protected areas. The depletion of reef fish species inside protected areas and reconsideration of the classification of pelagic gamefish require managerial attention. Partly protected areas in Mozambique need to be supplemented with no-take zones.

AB Squat lobsters of the deep-sea genus Munidopsis are among the most regularly reported crustaceans associated with deep-sea wood falls. They are often thought to indirectly use these substrates for preying or scavenging wood-associated molluscs or annelids, albeit the species M. andamanica has been recently highlighted as a xylophagous specialist. In this work, we examined the feeding appendages, gut contents and gut lining of M. nitida, M. bispinoculata and M. pilosa specimens from natural sunken woods and compared them with specimens of the same species having survived and grown on different hard-to-digest substrates (i.e. woods, turtle shells and whale bones) experimentally submerged in the deep South Pacific. In both cases, all three species directly ingest large wood fragments deeply degraded by microorganisms, but M. nitida also feeds on experimentally submerged whale bone and turtle shell fragments. Munidopsis nitida is also the only species to host a resident gut microflora, but the bacterial morphotypes vary according to the ingested substrate. The results suggest that the three species are most probably opportunistic, bacterivorous detritivores and that M. nitida could be at the beginning of an evolutionary process towards xylophagy within the genus Munidopsis.

AB Bush encroachment is a vegetation dynamic of global interest. This study describes the pattern of succession of bush clumps in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, using a space-for-time substitution. Clumps formed following establishment of mainly Acacia karroo in grassland through nucleation via animal dispersal. A total of 49 tree or shrub species were recorded in 40 clumps. With increasing clump size, there was a corresponding increase in woody basal area, species richness and diversity, but not evenness. Correspondence analysis showed that the pattern of compositional variation was closely related to clump size; differences resulting from clump establishment disappeared as clumps developed. Population size structure of 20 (of 21) species was dominated by small individuals, indicating that regeneration has increased over time. Coddia rudis was prolific on a clump periphery; Scutia myrtina and A. karroo were dominant within clumps. Seven shrub and nine tree species were encountered more frequently within a clump than on its periphery. All species other than A. karroo had fruits suited to dispersal by birds or mammals. The overall pattern of bush clump succession shows close parallels with that initiated by invasion of Prosopis glandulosa into grassland in Texas, USA.

AB The 1983-1984 mass mortality of Diadema antillarum produced severe damages on Caribbean reefs contributing to substantial changes in community structure that still persist. Despite the importance of Diadema grazing in structuring coral reefs, available information on current abundances and algal-urchin interactions in Cuba is scarce. We analyzed spatial variations in Diadema abundance and its influence on algal community structure in 22 reef sites in Jardines de la Reina, in June/2004 and April/2005. Urchins were counted in five 30x2m transects per site, and algal coverage was estimated in randomly located 0.25m side quadrats (15 per site). Abundances of Diadema were higher at reef crests (0.013-1.553 ind/m(2)), while reef slope populations showed values up to three orders of magnitude lower and were overgrown by macroalgae (up to 87%, local values). Algal community structure at reef slopes were dominated by macroalgae, especially Dictyota, Lobophora and Halimeda while the most abundant macroalgae at reef crests were Halimeda and Amphiroa. Urchin densities were negatively and positively correlated with mean coverage of macroalgae and crustose coralline algae, respectively, when analyzing data pooled across all sites, but not with data from separate habitats (specially reef crest), suggesting, along with historical fish biomass, that shallow reef community structure is being shaped by the synergistic action of other factors (e.g. fish grazing) rather than the influence of Diadema alone. However, we observed clear signs of Diadema grazing at reef crests and decreased macroalgal cover according to 2001 data, what suggest that grazing intensity at this habitat increased at the same time that Diadema recruitment began to be noticeable. Furthermore, the excessive abundance of macroalgae at reef slopes and the scarcity of crustose coralline algae seems to be due by the almost complete absence of D. antillarum at mid depth reefs, where local densities of this urchin were predominantly low.

AB The transplantation is an important method for the restoration of degraded ecosystem. However, it is unclear how the choice of species and transplantation mode affects the community dynamics during recovery from a disaster, particularly for long-lived organisms such as corals. To address this issue, we study a population dynamic model of multiple species in multiple habitats connected by larval dispersal. We first consider two species showing the trade-off relationship between growth rate and mortality and examine three restoration goals to evaluate the effectiveness of transplantation: (1) total coverage; (2) species diversity; (3) spatial heterogeneity of species composition. To promote the rapid development of total coverage, the transplantation of fast-growing species should be adopted. To maintain a high level of regional species diversity, the transplantation of slow-growing species or short-dispersal species is effective. Next, we suppose four genera of corals - Acropora, Pocillopora, Porites, and Favites - as an example of coral community in Okinawa where Pocillopora is facing to local extinction. In addition to three indexes; (4) recovery of locally endangered species is evaluated as a restoration goal. Results show that to promote the recovery of Pocillopora, the transplantation of the same species is clearly the most effective choice. In contrast, the transplantations of Acropora and Porites led to undesirable results. In summary, these results indicate that both the restoration goal and the transplanted species must be carefully selected before conducting transplantation operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effective management of endangered mammals requires reliable estimates of population size. This is challenging for species such as Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) that are distributed over large areas at low densities. Less than 2500 Grevy's zebra remain in the wild, scattered across 85,000 km2 of savannah in northern Kenya and Ethiopia. An efficient, accurate and repeatable survey method is required to guide conservation planning for the species. Currently, total aerial counts are used to census endangered species within Kenya, but are costly in terms of resources. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of sample survey methods for Grevy's zebra. We estimated population size using sample aerial counts for a known population of Grevy's zebra in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (LWC), providing the opportunity to test the accuracy of sample methods, while comparing resource costs with total count methods. We sampled one-third of LWC using parallel 500- m strip transects at 1500- m intervals. The population estimate was comparable to the known population size and was less than half as expensive as the equivalent total count survey. Our results suggest sample aerial surveys provide an accurate and cost-effective means of monitoring Grevy's zebra and other endangered species in open habitats.Resume
   La gestion efficace de mammiferes en danger exige des estimations fiables de la taille des populations. Ceci est un vrai defi pour des especes telles que le zebre de Grevy (Equus grevyi) qui sont distribuees en faible densite sur de vastes etendues. Il reste moins de 2500 zebres de Grevy dans la nature, eparpilles sur quelque 85.000 km2 de savane, dans le nord du Kenya et en Ethiopie. Il faut une methode d'etude efficace, exacte et reproductible pour guider la planification de la conservation de cette espece. Actuellement, on a recours a des comptages aeriens totaux pour recenser les especes menacees au Kenya, mais c'est une methode couteuse. Dans cette etude, nous avons evalue l'opportunite de methodes par echantillons pour le zebre de Grevy. Nous avons estime la taille de la population en utilisant des comptages echantillons d'une population de zebres de Grevy connue dans la Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (LWC), ce qui nous a donne l'occasion de tester l'exactitude de methodes par echantillons tout en comparant les couts avec les methodes de comptage complet. Nous avons echantillonne un tiers de LWC en tracant des transects paralleles de 500 m de large a intervalles de 1500 m. L'estimation de la population etait comparable a sa taille connue, et elle a coute moins de la moitie du denombrement total equivalent. Nos resultats suggerent que des recherches aeriennes par echantillons sont un moyen precis et economique de suivre le zebre de Grevy et d'autres especes en danger dans des habitats ouverts.

AB A TWINSPAN classification divides the moss flora of southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, and Lesotho) into two main bryofloristic elements: (1) the Xerophytic (south-western) element mainly distributed in the winter rainfall and semi-arid to arid, temperate areas of southern Africa, and (2) the Mesophytic (subtropical) element distributed in more stable, subtropical habitats of the northern, eastern and southern parts of southern Africa. The Xerophytic element is dominated by acrocarpous mosses, including the ephemerals, while the Mesophytic element contains most of the pleurocarpous mosses. The main Xerophytic element is subdivided into the Eastern Highlands and Cape Elements while the Mesophytic element consists of the Afromontane Grassland and Afromontane Forest Elements. The Afromontane Forest Element is the largest bryofloristic element and contains the most southern African moss endemics. The four bryofloristic elements are subdivided into eight subelements: the Eastern Highlands Element into the Mont Aux Sources and Widespread Subelements, the Cape Element into the West Coast and Boland Subelements, the Afromontane Grassland Element into the Disjunct Cape Peninsula and Drakensberg Subelements, and the Afromontane Forest Element into the Widespread Afromontane and Tropical Afromontane Subelements. Many of the bryofloristic elements and distribution centres correspond with phytogeographical elements and centres described for the seed plants of southern Africa. The Afromontane area in the south-western Cape is identified as a bryogeographical hotspot.

AB Ogasawara Islands are important ecosystems sustaining many indigenous spices. To clarify the indigenous soil environments of Ogasawara Islands, we studied the chemistry of the soils. Many surface soils were low in bio-available P (0 to 0.55 g P2O5 kg(-1), average: 0.04 g P2O5 kg(-1) as Bray II P, n = 22), but several soils were found to contain extremely large amounts of bio-available P (1.36 to 6.98 g P2O5 kg(-1), average: 2.93 g P2O5 kg(-1), n = 5). From soil profile analyses, the authors concluded that the extremely large amount of bio-available P could not be explained by the effects of parent materials with high P contents nor the effect of fertilizations by human activity, but the effects of natural seabird activities in the past could be the cause. The soil profiles with large amounts of bio-available P indicate deep migration of soil materials from A horizons, which could be a result of intensive mixing of upper horizons by seabird activities. The intensive mixing was supported by the low mechanical impedance of the horizons for the P-accumulating soils (8.17 +/- 2.54 kg cm(-2), n = 8) than those for the non-P-accumulating soils (17.46 +/- 3.52 kg cm(-2), n = 36). It is likely that in the past seabirds, such as shearwaters, made burrows in the soils for nesting and propagating and inadvertently transported a large amount of P from the sea to the soils, resulting in the extremely large amounts of bio-available P in the present soils.

TI Larval entrainment in cooling water intakes: spatially explicit models
   reveal effects on benthic metapopulations and shortcomings of
   traditional assessments

   DYNAMICS; FISH; REEF
AB Spatial management of marine populations typically requires consideration of larval dispersal pathways. When a power plant with a cooling water intake system (CWIS) is present, managers must also account for reductions in larval supply to natural habitats due to larval entrainment in the CWIS. To evaluate the consequences of CWIS entrainment for benthic populations, we coupled a transport model for an idealized coastline to a spatially explicit metapopulation model. CWIS entrainment reduced the probability of dispersal to and from sites near the CWIS. However, the reductions in larval supply due to entrainment generally produced only minor, localized effects on adult population density because of postsettlement density-dependent mortality. Only when population densities were already reduced by other forms of adult or larval mortality did entrainment threaten population persistence. Our simulations suggest that subpopulations several kilometres upstream of CWIS make the greatest contribution to metapopulation persistence by countering the effects of CWIS entrainment, and these locations should be the focus of conservation efforts to enhance larval sources. Finally, we show that traditional statistics used to estimate the demographic effects of CWIS entrainment are generally inaccurate and unreliable because they ignore nonlinearities in population dynamics.

AB Helicopters are used for numerous wildlife management and research purposes, but can alter wildlife behaviour and influence baseline data collection. We investigated reactions of GPS-collared moose Alces alces and brown bears Ursus arctos to short-term helicopter approaches by researchers. Moose responded with up to 10 times greater movement rates for up to two hours following a helicopter approach and moved into more rugged terrain. Brown bears decreased their speed and remained within similar habitat types and terrain. The movements were influenced only about two hours and did not influence the size of the activity areas. Contrary to our predictions, brown bears responded with a somewhat calmer response than moose, illustrating response differences in large herbivores and carnivores. This difference in response might be because brown bears are actually less disturbed than moose by direct helicopter approaches or because of a difference in tactical behaviour between brown bears and moose following disturbance. Researchers and managers should thus be cautious in using knowledge from one species to predict or perceive disturbance response in another species or taxa.

AB Aim
   To evaluate the role of habitat heterogeneity on species richness and turnover in the mega species-rich Cape Floristic Region (Cape), the mediterranean region of southern Africa.
   Location
   The Cape and Drakensberg regions of southern Africa.
   Methods
   Bioclimatic data were used to estimate habitat amount and habitat heterogeneity in the Cape and Drakensberg regions; these data were then used to explain the patterns of species diversity in the Pentaschistis clade (Poaceae) in these two regions. Habitat variables were used to create 'bioclimatic units' to characterize 1' x 1' cells in southern Africa and to describe the niches of species. Using these bioclimatic units, the niche and range sizes of species in the two regions were compared. A phylogram was used to test for age and lineage effects.
   Results
   Pentaschistis species diversity and turnover are higher in the Cape than the Drakensberg. There is no significant difference in the habitat amount and heterogeneity between the two regions. Species occupy the same range of estimated niche sizes, yet there are significantly more range-restricted Pentaschistis species in the Cape.
   Main conclusions
   The roles of age- and lineage-related effects are rejected; biodiversity differences lie in the regions. Current macrohabitat does not explain the differences in biodiversity between the two regions. The larger number of range-restricted species in the Cape cannot be explained by dispersal mechanism or the occupation of range-restricted habitats. Species of Pentaschistis and other Cape clades share characteristics associated with species from historically climatically stable areas, and palaeoclimatic and palaeontological evidence indicates the Cape climate has been more stable than the Drakensberg climate throughout the Pleistocene. We conclude that the corresponding lack of extinction might have allowed an accumulation of species in the Cape. Similar climatic and biological evidence for the south-west Australian Floristic and Mediterranean regions indicate that the same mechanism might explain the high species richness of these mediterranean regions.

ID HISTORY
AB The article explains, on the basis of literature and archival data, the use of exotic conifers in Estonian forest plantations froth 1918 to the present. Forest plantation projects in Estonia have tested about 100 exotic species from 11 genera, among which the European larch (Larix decidua) and Siberian larch (L. sibirica) and, to a lesser extent, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) have been of practical importance. More than 3500 ha of larch plantations have been established in Estonia, of which about 1000 ha have survived as stands. Also some smaller stands of fir species and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and clusters of trees of other exotic conifer species, can still be found today. The use of exotic species in the establishment of forest plantations has ceased by now since exotics are, as a rule, no match for native conifers in either their growth parameters or timber value. Nevertheless, they (larch species, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, etc.) are considered to be promising as pioneer species for the afforestation of farmlands and unused lands in extreme growth conditions, such as in exhausted oil shale opencast mines and opencast phosphorite mining areas.

AB The need to implement sustainable resource management regimes for semi-arid and and rangelands is acute as non-adapted grazing strategies lead to irreversible environmental problems such as desertification and associated loss of economic support to society. In these sensitive ecosystems, traditional sectoral, disciplinary approaches will not work to attain sustainability: achieving a collective vision of how to attain sustainability requires interactive efforts among disciplines in a more integrated approach.
   Therefore, we developed an integrated ecological-economic approach that consists of an ecological and an economic module and combines relevant processes on either level. Parameters for both modules are adjusted for an and dwarf shrub savannah in southern Namibia. The economic module is used to analyse decisions of different virtual farmer types on annual stocking rates depending on their knowledge how the ecosystem works and climatic conditions. We used a dynamic linear optimisation model to simulate farm economics and livestock dynamics. The ecological module is used to simulate the impact of the farmers' land-use decision, derived by the economic module, on ecosystem dynamics and resulting carrying capacity of the system for livestock. Vegetation dynamics, based on the concept of State-and-transition models, and forage productivity for both modules is derived by a small-scale and spatially explicit vegetation model. This mechanistic approach guarantees that data collected and processes estimated at smaller scales are included in our application. Simulation results of the ecological module were successfully compared to simulation results of the optimisation model for a time series of 30 years. We revealed that sustainable management of semi-arid and and rangelands relies strongly on rangeland managers' understanding of ecological processes. Furthermore, our simulation results demonstr n results demonstrate that the projected lower annual rainfall due to climate change adds an additional layer of risk to these ecosystems that are already prone to land degradation.

AB The occurrence of dry rainforest in climates considered drier than the recognised limit for rainforest has been explained by the edaphic compensation hypothesis, which proposed that finer-textured soils facilitate the occurrence of rainforest at climatic extremes. Wetested this by examining the effect of soil type on the water relations and plant traits of four dry rainforest species, during a severe drought and subsequent non-drought periods. We predicted plants growing in sandy soils would exhibit higher levels of water stress (lower predawn water potential and stomatal conductance) and possess morphological and physiological traits that more typically reflect drought resistance (late leaf fall in deciduous species, low specific leaf area, vertical leaf angles and stomata that close at low water potential) than those growing in loam soils. During drought, levels of water stress were similar across soil types, while post-drought plants on sandy soils were less stressed. Soil type did not cause shifts in drought tolerance traits, suggesting there has been no ecotypic differentiation of dry rainforest species across soil types for these traits. Hence, we found no support for the edaphic compensation hypothesis in adult plants; future studies should consider other life-cycle stages, such as seedlings.

   HISTORY
AB Maturation to adulthood and successful reproduction in the Antarctic fairy shrimp, Branchinecta gaini, must be completed within a physiologically challenging temporal window of ca. 2.5 months in the southern Antarctic Peninsula. Although adults show considerable metabolic opportunism at positive temperatures, little is known of their tolerance of two physiological insults potentially typical to pool life in the maritime Antarctic: sub-zero temperatures and salinity. B. gaini are freeze-avoiding crustaceans with temperatures of crystallisation (T(c)s) of -5 degrees C. No antifreeze proteins were detected in the haemolymph. Adults osmoregulate in relation to temperature, but rapid mortality in saline solutions of even low concentration, indicate they cannot osmoregulate in relation to salinity. Survival of ice encasement at temperatures above their T-c was found to be pressure but not time dependent: at severe inoculative ice pressures, there was little immediate survival and none survived after 48 h below -2 degrees C; at mild inoculative ice pressures, immediate survival was ca. 100% at -3 degrees C, but < 20% after 48 h. There was no significant difference in survival after 1 and 6 h encasement at -3 degrees C. Observations of ventilation suggest that it is not low temperature per se, but ice that represents the primary cryo-stress, with ventilatory appendages physically handcuffed below the freezing point of pool water. Both sub-zero temperatures and salinity represent real physiological constraints on adult fairy shrimp.

AB The goal of this study was to investigate the alterations of diet of a piscivorous fish (Acestrorhynchus pantaneiro) following changes in abundance of a forage fish (Moenkhausia dichroura) during the trophic upsurge stage in a reservoir. Fish samplings were taken monthly in the Manso Reservoir (State of Mato Grosso, Brazil) from March 2000 to February 2001 (period I) and from March 2003 to February 2004 (period II). The abundance of Moenkhausia dichroura in the reservoir was significantly different in both periods, representing 9.6% of the individuals in period I and 66.4% in period II. Stomach contents analyses showed that the number of prey species consumed by A. pantaneiro decreased from 41 prey in period I to 14 in period II. In the last period M. dichroura was the most important prey, comprising 95% of the diet, in contrast with the period I when this species represented only 15% of the diet. The predator and prey size relationship was positive in both periods, however was significantly different, because small and large predators consumed mainly small prey (M. dichroura) in period II. Thus, the results showed that A. pantaneiro altered its diet composition, trophic niche breadth and prey sizes to feed on more abundant and accessible prey. These alterations probably caused a decrease in energy costs related to prey searching, maximizing the energy gain of the predator.

AB Bush encroachment is a phenomenon that affects semi-arid savannas world-wide. To apply effective browsing to control trees, the browse-browser interaction must be well understood. An important aspect is feedbacks between browsers and trees because browsers influence the nutritional value of plants. When resources are abundant, tannins, which are assumed to negatively affect browsers, are predicted to decrease following herbivory because defoliation is assumed to reduce C relative to N. In opposite conditions, defoliation is expected to increase tannins by increasing C relative to N. A split-plot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of irrigation, fertiliser, grass cover and clipping on leaf N, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and condensed tannin (CT) concentrations of Acacia karroo seedlings in a semi-arid savanna. Clipping reduced N of irrigated plants, and increased N of unirrigated plants, in the absence of grass cover. By reducing N, clipping in relatively high resource conditions resulted in reduced potential value of the seedlings as fodder. The reverse occurred in relatively low resource conditions through N elevation. The development of negative feedback in conditions that promote woody seedling encroachment would render bush control by browsing difficult. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We describe the development and parameterization of a grid-based model of African savanna vegetation processes. The model was developed with the objective of exploring elephant effects on the diversity of savanna species and structure, and in this formulation concentrates on the relative cover of grass and woody plants, the vertical structure of the woody plant community, and the distribution of these over space. Grid cells are linked by seed dispersal and fire, and environmental variability is included in the form of stochastic rainfall and fire events. The model was parameterized from an extensive review of the African savanna literature; when available, parameter values varied widely. The most plausible set of parameters produced long-term coexistence between woody plants and grass, with the tree-grass balance being more sensitive to changes in parameters influencing demographic processes and drought incidence and response, while less sensitive to fire regime. There was considerable diversity in the woody structure of savanna systems within the range of uncertainty in tree growth rate parameters. Thus, given the paucity of height growth data regarding woody plant species in southern African savannas, managers of natural areas should be cognizant of different tree species growth and damage response attributes when considering whether to act on perceived elephant threats to vegetation.

AB The main objective of our study is to determine whether regeneration of Pinus pinea (an exotic species) is spreading within a Pinus canariensis (native species) stand. The study area is located in the Natural Park of Tamadaba, 1400 in asl., in the NW of Gran Canaria Island (Canary Islands). Stems and regeneration of P. canariensis and P pinea were mapped in five randomly selected plots where both species were planted together around 45 years ago. Densities and basal areas of both species were also recorded. P. canariensis demonstrated a greater ability to disperse than P. pinea. The two species showed different spatial patterns, with R pinea tending toward a more aggregate spatial distribution of individuals than P canariensis. Bivariate spatial relationships showed no difference from a random spatial distribution, indicating the lack of any pattern of aggregation or rejection between the species. These results indicated that P. pinea has not spread because it is less able to disperse (strongly barochorus) than P. canariensis (barochorus and anemochorus). Given that the future ability of P. pinea to disperse cannot be predicted, eradication of this species, together with additional plantings of P. canariensis in open areas, is proposed to restore the P. canariensis stand.

AB With a growing need for wildlife conservation and management in the communal lands of Africa, comprehensive ecological monitoring tools need to be developed and evaluated. While wildlife census methods are often compared in terms of precision and accuracy to estimate the population size of various target species, little attention has been paid to the measure of species diversity in mammal communities. A combined measure of abundance and community composition is, however, a crucial source of information in determining conservation priorities and to evaluate the ecosystem responses to management activities. In this study, we present five census methods of large to medium-sized mammals and compare their efficacy in measuring species diversity. A species accumulation curve analysis is used with a predictive model to estimate the local species richness, the level of completeness of our censuses as well as the effort required to carry out a census. Advantages and limits of each method are discussed through comparison of their respective measure of species richness and their species accumulation rate. Results illustrate a large difference between methods in the ability for species detection, with censuses completed by bicycle offering the best option within the context of a unprotected area.

AB The remarkable biodiversity of the littoral zone of Lake Tanganyika appears to be at risk through increasing sediment input caused by anthropogenic pressures. An in-situ field experiment was done to investigate the effects of increased sediment loads on the size-structure of gastropod communities on a rocky shore site in the lake. Gastropods were removed prior to the addition of sediment, and subsequent further removals were done after seven days and six months. Relative to controls, mean size of individuals of both Lavigeria grandis (Smith) and Lavigeria sp. Q decreased following the addition of sediment, while that of Lavigeria sp. P increased. A subsequent laboratory experiment found that survivorship of larger individuals of Lavigeria grandis was less than smaller individuals in the sediment-impacted treatment. It is hypothesised that decreased algal availability on sediment-impacted rock surface increased starvation of larger snails. Alterations to the size-structure of Lavigeria sp. P populations appear related to intraspecific differences in competitive ability. These results highlight the complex and unpredictable effects of increases in sediment loads on aquatic ecosystems and have implications for the conservation of littoral communities in sediment-impacted areas.

AB Cernek Lake is one of the most valuable wetlands of Northern Turkey. The lake and the surrounding wetlands are characterized by a high degree of biodiversity with reference to the species and natural habitats, so it has been recognized as a "Ramsar Site". The lake is a typical shallow lagoon lake, which is subjected to human activities such as discharge of sewage. In order to evaluate the biotic community and estimate the pollution level, the physical and chemical variables and plankton dynamics were investigated during the study period. The plankton composition was typical for an eutrophic ecosystem. Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta. mainly were the dominant algal assemblages in terms of abundance. The zooplankton community was dominated by Rotifers (Brachionus and Keratella), whereas small Cladocera (Chydorus sphaericus and Bosmina longirostris) was also important in fall months. Primary production ranged between 569 and 4303 mg C m(-2) day(-1), while chlorophyll a ranged between 4.12 and 541.5 mg m(-3). The chlorophyll a content indicated also that the lake was eutrophic with hypertrophic tendency.

AB The leaf properties and construction costs ( CC) are reported for eight indigenous heath (kerangas) forest species and three invasive (exotic) species of Acacia. Both groups of species co-occur and colonise disturbed lowland tropical heath rainforest habitats in Brunei, Borneo Island. Across species, CC mass-based increased with nitrogen (N) and heat of combustion (H-C), and decreased with ash content. CC area-based showed similar trends ( although weaker in strength) in addition to significant positive correlation with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Within the native species, the CCs of the shrub and small tree species were lower and significantly different from those of medium-sized tree species. Given the invasive success of the three acacias, it is hypothesised that these species may require less energy for biomass construction than do the native species. Within similar life growth form, no difference in CC mass-based was detected between the native trees and the invasive acacias. For CC area-based, the invasive Acacia species had a higher value. These findings failed to uphold our hypothesis. LMA and leaf N and phosphorus (P), but not potassium (K), were higher in the invasive acacias. The higher N and LMA could have been the cause of higher CC area-based in the invasive acacias. From the ordination of 11 species on the basis of leaf properties, the invasive and native species are more likely to be found in different groupings-although some native species seem more affiliated with the invasive than with their own guild, especially Alphitonia and Macaranga.

AB We examined patterns of cpDNA RFLP variability using 21 restriction endonucleases in 21 populations of Androcymbium that represent 12 endemic species distributed in the winter rainfall areas of South Africa to explore the diversification of the genus in its area of triaximum species diversity. Our results are supportive of a diversification landscape characterized by continued opportunistic short-range invasion, naturalization, and rapid speciation, in which the selective action of the different environments where Androcymbium species Occur determined their colonization success and subsequent short-range geographic expansion. The historical presence of fire, the constraint imposed by the low concentration of nutrients throughout southwestern South Africa and the different reproductive capabilities of Androcymbium species have also likely stimulated species' diversification. Our divergence time estimates bolster the view that speciation of South African Androcymbium initiated in the late Eocene, intensified in the Oligocene and proceeded more sporadically during the Miocene. These chronological estimates also substantiate the previous hypothesis that most lineages of Androcymbium in South Africa are much more ancient than their North African relatives, whose diversification began in the late Miocene-early Pliocene.

AB Two forms (here called short and long) of the tadpole shrimp Triops from the Baja California peninsula (Mexico) exhibit interesting features for aquacultural purposes; rapid growth, early maturation (six days) and uniparental reproduction via cysts (i.e. drought-resistant dormant eggs). The use of Triops for aquaculture depends on the standard production of viable cysts. Basic information on the reproductive potential of Triops is scarce. Using a recirculating system, we studied, through two culture tests, the cyst production, frequency of molting, and growth rate of the two Mexican forms. For each form, individual data were obtained from five specimens in Test 1 over 15 days, and from 10 specimens in Test 2 over 20 days. Hatching response of cysts produced in Test 1 was also studied. The short-form showed a high fecundity depositing groups of cysts from the ovisacs several times a day. The mean cyst production per day was 156-306 (Test 1 & 2), and the mean total cyst production was 2028 (range 728-3193) (Test 1), and 5821 (range 4136-7554) (Test 2). The maximum number of cysts deposited by one short-form individual in a day was 1231 (Test 2). The reproductive performance of the long-form was poor. The mean cyst production per day was only 4.2-7.9 (Test 1 & 2). The short-form molted every 2.5-2.8 days and the long-form molted every 2.8-3.7 days. The mean growth rate calculated from the standard length (mm d(-1)) of the short-form was 0.43-0.84 (Test 1 & 2), and in the long-form the values were 0.84-1.25 (Test 1 & 2). The poor cyst production of the long-form may be explained by inadequate food resources that did not fulfill the nutritional requirements for reproduction. Given its prolific uniparental reproduction (vs. biparental reproduction), the short-form Triops appears as a good potential candidate for aquaculture.

ID TURBID RESERVOIR; ZOOPLANKTON; COMMUNITY
AB Basic features of the physical and biological limnology of Wagendrift Dam, a moderately large impoundment on the Boesmans River, were studied between July 1989 and May 1990. This man-made lake showed a typical monomictic pattern of summer stratification (November through April) and holomictic winter circulation (May to October). Water quality was chemically good (Department of Water Affairs and Forestry records), with little evidence of nutrient enrichment. Water clarity during the study was moderately low (mean SD and K-dPAR values of 0.45 m and 2.55 m(-1)), with little evidence of persistent mineral turbidity, suggesting reasonably satisfactory catchment conditions. In keeping with the low nutrient status, surface chlorophyll content remained below 5 mug l(-1) throughout the study. In terms of ecological groupings, the phytoplankton was numerically dominated mostly by 'Competitive' green algae for most of the year. 'Stress-tolerant' cyanophytes were continuously sparse, but were marginally more abundant during summer stratification. Diatoms and other disturbance-tolerant 'ruderal' algae persisted throughout the year. No spring peak in ruderal algae was evident, but it may have been masked by high zooplankton grazing pressure. An autumnal peak in ruderal algae coincided broadly with flood-related inflows and annual de-stratification.
   Zooplankton was dominated (numerically and/or gravimetrically) by typical clear-water taxa. The copepod Tropodiaptomus spectabilis and cladoceran Daphnia pulex along with various unidentified cyclopoids and rotifers were seasonally persistent, while other cladoceran taxa (D. laevis and Diaphanosoma excisum) showed considerable seasonal periodicity. Zooplankton standing stock was collectively substantial, annually averaging around 0.65 g.m(-2) DM, and approaching 1 g.m(-2) DM in spring/early summer, implying potentially significant natural grazer-control of phytoplankton, aided perhaps by large numbers of benthic bivalve molluscs (Unio caffer), observed stranded in littoral margins following reservoir draw-down.

ID ANOSTRACA; SURVIVAL; BIOLOGY; IRELAND; LATIUM
AB Life histories of two populations of Tanymastix stagnalis from sites in central Italy, differing in climate and altitude above sea level, were compared to obtain information on the tolerance limits of this species.
   Temperature was the main factor affecting the biology of Tanymastix stagnalis. Significant differences in growth patterns occurred at different sites. A colder climate induced delayed hatching, slower differentiation and maturation, but a longer life span in the mountain population (Forca Canapine) than in the plain (Fosso dei Mergani).
   Both populations exhibited an initial fluctuating sex ratio, which later became female biased, a pattern which could be the consequence of adaptation to the unstable nature of the biotopes studied.

The highest levels for total N and P, % C, nitrite and ammonia (but not nitrate) were associated with the nest itself. Elevated levels of all nutrients still occurred at 1 m from the nest but dropped to levels similar to those of non-bird influenced soils at 2 m or 5 m from the nest. Highest bacterial and algal numbers were also associated with the nest. An experiment to examine the breakdown of guano showed nitrification levels to be insignificant and nutrient release levels very slow.

ID HISTORY; CLASSIFICATION
AB Palaeoecological evidence from a pollen sequence in eastern Spain does not support the notion of potential vegetation as employed by the floristic-phytosociological approach of vegetation classification. A middle Holocene replacement of Pinus forest by Quercus-dominated communities is interpreted as the result of increased fires in the surroundings of the site and suggests that sclerophyllous scrub in the region could not have been determined by climatic conditions as previously assumed. Therefore it cannot be considered to be a climax state of vegetation. The possible role of anthropogenic and random processes in this change should not be underestimated.

AB Cultures of a species of Vibrio isolated from fish intestines and known to synthesize the polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) were incubated with di-[1-C-14]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine to determine if lipolytic enzymes are produced by the bacteria. After two days of culture, most radioactivity was recovered in the phospholipids of the bacterial cells. When supernatants from cultures of the Vibrio were incubated with either di-[1-C-14]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-C-14]linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine or 1-[1-C-14]palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine almost all radioactivity was recovered in the free fatty acid fraction after 24 h. Only very small levels of radioactivity from di-[1-C-14]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine were recovered in diacylglycerols and phosphatidic acid. Over the same incubation period 61% and 5% of the radioactivity originally present in glycerol tri-[1-C-14]oleate and cholesteroyl [1-C-14]oleate, respectively, was released to free fatty acids. Soybean phosphatidylcholine and cod roe phosphatidylcholine, which differed in polyunsaturated fatty acid profile, were both hydrolyzed by culture supernatant. The results suggest that the Vibrio species examined produces a phospholipase B capable of hydrolyzing both intact phospholipids and lysophospholipids.

The resting metabolic rates of Cueta sp., F. intermedia and Palpares annulatus were between 5.4-8.9% of the expected values for similar-sized poikilothermic invertebrates. These values indicate low energy demands, which is crucial to survive prolonged periods of starvation.
   The non-pitbuilding antlion larva, F. intermedia, was generally more active than Cueta sp., with an unexpectedly high specific metabolic rate fbr its body size. Furgella intermedia had lower Q(10) values between 10-30 degrees C than the pitbuilder Cueta sp., implying a larger metabolic tolerance to these temperatures.
   The increase in metabolism after feeding (ranging between 2.8-3.7 times pre-feeding metabolism) was lowest for the larger P. annulatus, indicating low feeding costs for this species. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB 1. We examined selected aspects of the nutritional ecology of larval Ptychoptera paludosa and their role in nutrient cycling in the Breitenbach, a first-order stream in Hesse, Germany.
   2. Food preference experiments demonstrated significant preference for sediments with a high organic matter content and live bacteria.
   3. pH was circumneutral in all sections of the gut.
   4. Enzymatic activity (beta-glucosidase and amino-peptidase) in different parts of the gut was measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (MUF-Glc) and leucine-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide (Leu-MCA). beta-glucosidase activity was highest in the hindgut.
   5. The mean larval gut passage time was between 7 and 8 h.
   6. The egestion rate of last instar larvae was about 0.35 mg dry weight (DW) faeces per larva h(-1) and about 1.25 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) faeces per mg larval AFDW day(-1).
   7. Larval faeces contained at least 4-18 times more organic matter than the average in the sediments in which they were feeding, that is, larvae fed selectively, extracting organic matter from sediments.
   8. P, paludosa larvae are important in the dynamics of detritus in slow-flowing reaches of the Breitenbach. They gather organic material from the sediment to a depth of 3 cm, and release it as faeces onto the sediment surface. A total of 770 g DW faeces m(-2) yr(-1), comprising about 16% organic matter, was produced by the Ptychoptera population.

AB Ephemeral wetlands, such as vernal pools and playas, have become increasingly threatened by a variety of destructive human practices, including off-highway vehicle (OHV) activity. Among the resident animals that may be adversely affected are the branchiopod crustaceans which produce desiccation resistant cysts to withstand the pools' dry periods. We report a quantitative investigation of the force required to crush individual branchiopod cysts of 8 species: Branchinecta lynchi, B. sandiegonensis, B. mackini, Streptocephalus woottoni, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Linderiella occidentalis, Lepidurus lemmoni, and Triops longicaudata. Very small forces of less than 1 newton crushed dry cysts. Wet cysts were even more fragile; many were crushed under less than 7 x 10(-2) newtons. Differences in vulnerability were found within and between taxa and may be related to cyst morphology. Knowledge of these effects should be taken into consideration when developing management strategies for ephemeral wetlands.

AB The role of larval intraspecific competition in laboratory populations of Drosophila subobscura was investigated. Mortality is density-independent during the first 3 days after hatching but becomes density dependent as development proceeds to pupation. Although total biomass per patch was independent of initial egg density, competition between Drosophila larvae leads to the formation of smaller pupae. This resulted in a population that was dominated by suppressed individuals. Development rate of D. subobscura larvae was not affected by high larval densities. Smaller pupae give rise to females with fewer eggs in their ovarioles. A simple simulation model, predicting the effects of intraspecific competition on the fecundity of the next Drosophila generation is described.

AB Using Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), I tested the hypotheses that energy limitation, as proposed by Ashmole (1963) and Lack (1968), is the reason pelagic seabirds have evolved small clutch sizes and slow growth of young. Degree of food demand on adults was altered in 26 nests by 1) increasing the brood size, 2) causing chicks to regurgitate one meal day(-1), 3) switching different aged chicks among nests and 4) supplementally feeding chicks. Adults immediately increased amount of food delivered to the nest when demand increased, and reduced amount of food delivered when demand decreased. In nests in which different aged chicks were placed, adults altered their behavior and food delivery instantaneously and appropriately. The rate of wing growth in chicks (mm day(-1)) was sensitive over short periods to the amount of food delivered, yielding significant variability in growth rate. Fledging success (from eggs hatched) in control and experimental nests were 100%, even during an El Nino-Southern Oscillation event, when food delivery was significantly reduced. The ability of chicks to adapt growth rates, and of adults to adjust their energy budget to various levels of demand indicates that these birds are not strictly energy limited and, thus, their life history adaptations are not necessarily linked only to energetic constraints.

AB Gelidium pristoides dominates the lower and mid-eulittoral zones of rocky shores in the eastern Cape, South Africa. A disproportionately high percentage of the plants is attached to barnacle and limpet shells, or restricted to rock crevices. Our experiments at Port Alfred indicate that this distribution is caused by grazing by the limpet Patella oculus and/or strength of attachment of the plants to the different substrata. Exclusion of limpets caused an approximately four-fold increase in the cover of G. pristoides on rock, and an increase from almost 0 to 80% cover on sterilised (dead) limpet shells. Measurements showed G. pristoides to be more than 50% more strongly attached to barnacle and limpet shells than to rock. The distribution of G. pristoides on the various substrata is largely determined by limpet grazing and possibly the different strengths of attachment to the different substrata. The upper distribution limit of G. pristoides is set by physical effects of emersion and was largely unaffected by limpet exclusion. Competition with other algae is important in setting the lower limit: in the sublittoral fringe, although limpet exclusion enhanced recruitment, juveniles were later displaced by articulated corallines, and adult transplants senesced because of encrusting coralline epiphytes.

AB The ability of the Black Noddy to raise an artificially enlarged brood and the effect of brood enlargement on prefledging growth and mortality were examined on Heron Island during the 1983-84 breeding season. Where chicks from enlarged broods were the same age brood enlargement did not affect nestling growth or mortality. This suggests adults were able to compensate for the increased energy requirements of a second brood member. Reproductive output from enlarged broods was not limited by the total quantity of food available, or by the ability of adults to find and transport this food. Where chicks were different ages intra-brood competition reduced the amount of food obtained by younger chicks, causing a retardation of flight feather development. A slowing in wing development was not accompanied by a reduction in the rate of weight increase. Feather development slows before starvation is apparent; this suggests wing growth may be modified so that nutrients essential for body maintenance and the growth of soft tissue are available during periods of low food availability. In the Black Noddy maximum body weight is attained significantly earlier than full wing length. Differences in the rate of weight and wing length increase, the ability of adults to raise an enlarged brood and the further slowing of only feather development during food stress, suggest that 'normal' wing development in this species may be adjusted to some minimum level of a fluctuating food resource, rather than to consistently low levels of food availability. Such a mode of development can be interpreted as an adaptive response to large variations in the quantity of food obtained at any one feeding and/or the extended period of time between consecutive feeding bouts.

AB Recent findings point to plant root traits as potentially important for shaping the boundaries of biomes and for maintaining the plant communities within. We examined two hypotheses: 1) Thin-rooted plant strategies might be favored in biomes with low soil resources; and 2) these strategies may act, along with fire, to maintain the sharp boundary between the Fynbos and Afrotemperate Forest biomes in South Africa. These biomes differ in biodiversity, plant traits, and physiognomy, yet exist as alternative stable states on the same geological substrate and in the same climate conditions. We conducted a 4-y field experiment to examine the ability of Forest species to invade the Fynbos as a function of growth-limiting nutrients and belowground plant-plant competition. Our results support both hypotheses: First, we found marked biome differences in root traits, with Fynbos species exhibiting the thin-nest roots reported from any biome worldwide. Second, our field manipulation demonstrated that intense belowground competition inhibits the ability of Forest species to invade Fynbos. Nitrogen was unexpectedly the resource that determined competitive outcome, despite the long-standing expectation that Fynbos is severely phosphorus constrained. These findings identify a trait-by-resource feedback mechanism, in which most species possess adaptive traits that modify soil resources in favor of their own survival while deterring invading species. Our findings challenge the long-held notion that biome boundaries depend primarily on external abiotic constraints and, instead, identify an internal biotic mechanism-a selective feedback among traits, plant-plant competition, and ecosystem conditions-that, along with contrasting fire regime, can act to maintain biome boundaries.

AB This paper synthesizes the contemporary challenges for the sustainability of the social-environmental system (SES) across a geographically, environmentally, and geopolitically diverse region-the Asian Drylands Belt (ADB). This region includes 18 political entities, covering 10.3% of global land area and 30% of total global drylands. At the present time, the ADB is confronted with a unique set of environmental and socioeconomic changes including water shortage-related environmental challenges and dramatic institutional changes since the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The SES of the ADB is assessed using a conceptual framework rooted in the three pillars of sustainability science: social, economic, and ecological systems. The complex dynamics are explored with biophysical, socioeconomic, institutional, and local context-dependent mechanisms with a focus on institutions and land use and land cover change (LULCC) as important drivers of SES dynamics. This paper also discusses the following five pressing, practical challenges for the sustainability of the ADB SES: (a) reduced water quantity and quality under warming, drying, and escalating extreme events, (b) continued, if not intensifying, geopolitical conflicts, (c) volatile, uncertain, and shifting socioeconomic structures, (d) globalization and cross-country influences, and (e) intensification and shifts in LULCC. To meet the varied challenges across the region, place-based, context-dependent transdisciplinary approaches are needed to focus on the human-environment interactions within and between regional landscapes with explicit consideration of specific forcings and regulatory mechanisms. Future work focused on this region should also assess the role of the following mechanisms that may moderate SES dynamics: socioeconomic regulating mechanisms, biophysical regulating mechanisms, regional and national institutional regulating mechanisms, and localized institutional regulating mechanisms.

AB Background After the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, the government used community-based pandemic prevention and control as the core strategy to fight the pandemic, and explored a set of standardized community pandemic prevention measures that were uniformly implemented throughout the city. One month later, the city announced its first lists of "high-risk" communities and COVID-19-free communities. Under the standardized measures of pandemic prevention and mitigation, why some communities showed a high degree of resilience and effectively avoided escalation, while the situation spun out of control in other communities? This study investigated: 1) key factors that affect the effective response of urban communities to the pandemic, and 2) types of COVID-19 susceptible communities. Methods This study employs the crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis method to explore the influencing variables and possible causal condition combination paths that affect community resilience during the pandemic outbreak. Relying on extreme-case approach, 26 high-risk communities and 14 COVID-19 free communities were selected as empirical research subjects from the lists announced by Wuhan government. The community resilience assessment framework that evaluates the communities' capacity on pandemic prevention and mitigation covers four dimensions, namely spatial resilience, capital resilience, social resilience, and governance resilience, each dimension is measured by one to three variables. Results The results of measuring the necessity of 7 single-condition variables found that the consistency index of "whether the physical structure of the community is favorable to virus transmission" reached 0.9, which constitutes a necessary condition for COVID-19 susceptible communities. By analyzing the seven condition configurations with high row coverage and unique coverage in the obtained complex solutions and intermediate solutions, we found that outbreaks are most likely to occur in communities populated by disadvantaged populations. However, if lacking spatial-, capital-, and governance resilience, middle-class and even wealthy communities could also become areas where COVID-19 spreads easily. Conclusions Three types of communities namely vulnerable communities, alienated communities, and inefficient communities have lower risk resilience. Spatial resilience, rather than social resilience, constitutes the key influencing factor of COVID-19-susceptible communities, and the dual deficiencies of social resilience and governance resilience are the common features of these communities.

AB Rapid climate change is impacting biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human well-being. Though the magnitude and trajectory of climate change are becoming clearer, our understanding of how these changes reshape terrestrial life zones-distinct biogeographic units characterized by biotemperature, precipitation, and aridity representing broad-scale ecosystem types-is limited. To address this gap, we used high-resolution historical climatologies and climate projections to determine the global distribution of historical (1901-1920), contemporary (1979-2013), and future (2061-2080) life zones. Comparing the historical and contemporary distributions shows that changes from one life zone to another during the 20th century impacted 27 million km(2) (18.3% of land), with consequences for social and ecological systems. Such changes took place in all biomes, most notably in Boreal Forests, Temperate Coniferous Forests, and Tropical Coniferous Forests. Comparing the contemporary and future life zone distributions shows the pace of life zone changes accelerating rapidly in the 21st century. By 2070, such changes would impact an additional 62 million km(2) (42.6% of land) under "business-as-usual" (RCP8.5) emissions scenarios. Accelerated rates of change are observed in hundreds of ecoregions across all biomes except Tropical Coniferous Forests. While only 30 ecoregions (3.5%) had over half of their areas change to a different life zone during the 20th century, by 2070 this number is projected to climb to 111 ecoregions (13.1%) under RCP4.5 and 281 ecoregions (33.2%) under RCP8.5. We identified weak correlations between life zone change and threatened vertebrate richness, levels of vertebrate endemism, cropland extent, and human population densities within ecoregions, illustrating the ubiquitous risks of life zone changes to diverse social-ecological systems. The accelerated pace of life zone changes will increasingly challenge adaptive conservation and sustainable development strategies that incorrectly assume current ecological patterns and livelihood provisioning systems will persist.

AB The scopes related to the interplay between stem cells and the immune system are broad and range from the basic understanding of organism's physiology and ecology to translational studies, further contributing to (eco)toxicology, biotechnology, and medicine as well as regulatory and ethical aspects. Stem cells originate immune cells through hematopoiesis, and the interplay between the two cell types is required in processes like regeneration. In addition, stem and immune cell anomalies directly affect the organism's functions, its ability to cope with environmental changes and, indirectly, its role in ecosystem services. However, stem cells and immune cells continue to be considered parts of two branches of biological research with few interconnections between them. This review aims to bridge these two seemingly disparate disciplines towards much more integrative and transformative approaches with examples deriving mainly from aquatic invertebrates. We discuss the current understanding of cross-disciplinary collaborative and emerging issues, raising novel hypotheses and comments. We also discuss the problems and perspectives of the two disciplines and how to integrate their conceptual frameworks to address basic equations in biology in a new, innovative way.

AB In this multi-proxy palaeo study, the response of primary producers and consumers to anthropogenic disturbances in a large shallow lake was investigated. Overall, eutrophication and water-level changes (partly inferred by bisaccate pollen grains) are well-reflected in changes in sedimentation rates of pigments, diatom and cladoceran species composition and other proxies (e.g. Rhabdocoela oocytes). In particular, the stepwise decrease in relative abundance of Pediastrum simplex compared to P. boryanum/P. duplex proved to be a good indicator for eutrophication intensity. Furthermore, reductions in the body size (i.e. coenobia diameter) of Pediastrum simplex were clearly related to phases of low visibility that were caused by lake damming in the 1950 s and by accelerating eutrophication in the 1990 s. During the latter period, strong algal growth led to turbid conditions, which are indicated by the co-occurrence of the diatoms Fragilaria crotonensis, Aulacoseira ambigua and A. granulata, the green algae Staurastrum sp. as well as the cladoceran Anthalona cf. milleri. This study highlights that subfossil remains, which are often found in, for instance, standard cladoceran analysis (green algae such as Pediastrum spp. and Staurastrum spp. or bisaccate pollen grains), can add valuable information to the reconstruction of past environmental conditions and biotic response. Such better and more holistic understanding of freshwater ecosystems is crucial to meet future challenges in a rapidly changing world.

AB In many species of marine benthic invertebrates, a planktonic larval phase plays a critical role in dispersal. Very little is known about the larval biology of most species, however, in part because species identification has historically been hindered by the microscopic size and morphological similarity among related taxa. This study aimed to determine the taxonomic composition and seasonal distribution of meroplankton in the Barents Sea, across the Polar Front. We collected meroplankton during five time points seasonally and used high-throughput DNA barcoding of individual larvae to obtain species-level information on larval seasonality. We found that meroplankton was highly diverse (72 taxa from eight phyla) and present in the Barents Sea yearround with a peak in abundance in August and November, defying the conventional wisdom that peak abundance would coincide with the spring phytoplankton bloom. Ophiuroids, bivalves, and polychaetes dominated larval abundance while gastropods and polychaetes accounted for the bulk of the taxon diversity. Community structure varied seasonally and total abundance was generally higher south of the Polar Front while taxon richness was overall greater to the north. Of the species identified, most were known inhabitants of the Barents Sea. However, the nemertean Cephalothrix iwatai and the brittle star Ophiocten gracilis were abundant in the meroplankton despite never having been previously recorded in the northern Barents Sea. The new knowledge on seasonal patterns of individual meroplanktonic species has implications for understanding environment-biotic interactions in a changing Arctic and provides a framework for early detection of potential newcomers to the system.

AB Nutrient enrichment can negatively affect natural plant communities and result in the loss of species diversity and productivity. Despite this, fertiliser (especially phosphorus) is typically applied to restore highly biodiverse communities. Long-term effects of nutrient addition to restored plant communities, particularly those adapted to inherently low nutrient soils, have received little attention. We report results of a large-scale 20-year field experiment established in West Australian jarrah forest restored after bauxite mining Three P-application rates were applied (0, 80 and 120 kg ha- 1) once at the beginning of the experiment, and plant communities monitored after 1, 6, 13 and 20 years. One year after the onset of restoration, native plant species richness and plant density was highest at 80 and 120 kg P ha- 1. Subsequently, native species richness, plant density, and the richness and density of seeder and slow-growing resprouter species were highest without fertilisation, establishing the negative impact of P enrichment on plant community and ecosystem development in P impoverished soils. Total plant cover was similar for all P treatments across the chronosequence which, when combined with higher stem densities at zero P, suggests zero P favoured smaller, slower growing species. Applied-P initially favoured weeds and ephemerals and, while these species declined over time, other species were lost from these plots. The similarity of the restored communities to unmined reference jarrah forest increased over time and was consistently highest at in the absence of P fertiliser. Jarrah forest restoration is assumed to follow the initial floristic model of plant succession. However, we question this assumption and instead suggest that successional outcomes are contingent on P fertilisation rather than initial floristics per se. Applied P retarded recruitment of resprouter species that were present at zero P, debunking the assumption under IFM that these species do not disperse to restored areas. Consequently, based on the most comprehensive long-term study of P-fertilisation in the context of restoration of P-impoverished ecosystems yet reported, we propose that P limitation is important for the recreation of species diversity in inherently P impoverished forests. These results highlight the necessity of longterm experiments for understanding forest successional dynamics and implications for restoration practices.

AB Seabirds maintain island ecosystem function by providing rich marine-derived nutrients to the islands where they nest. These nutrients are returned to the sea through runoff, fertilizing the nearshore environment. Invasive predators disrupt this bottom-up control by decimating seabird populations. While invasive predator eradications lead to terrestrial recovery on seabird islands, there is little information on the nearshore impact. We determined how nearshore macroalgae communities and seabird-derived nitrogen concentrations are influenced by predator eradications and environmental parameters (sampling depth, season, wave exposure, and runoff). This case study examined 4 islands in the Mercury Islands archipelago, representing 3 eradication histories: never invaded by mammalian predators, eradicated over 30 yr ago, and eradicated 2 yr ago. Macroalgal diversity was highest at never-invaded islands, followed by islands in order of eradication year (eradicated 30 and 2 yr ago). The amount of seabird-derived nitrogen (delta N-15) in algae was higher during the rainy season and decreased with sampling depth and wave exposure. Sampling near high runoff points resulted in increased delta N-15 in red algae alone. Never-invaded islands had the highest delta N-15 in most species. With species found at both eradicated islands, the recently eradicated island had unexpectedly higher delta N-15 than the island eradicated over 30 yr ago. This discrepancy may be a result of the recently eradicated island's large size and presence of streams, estuaries, and sheltered bays. Studying nearshore habitats is crucial in understanding the extent to which seabirds act as a conduit of the land-sea interface and the marine impacts of island management.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exposed serious deficiencies in the current legal framework to protect wild animal health, and consequently human health. As noted by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), animal health and welfare are inextricably linked. However, there is no international agreement to promote animal welfare and neither the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the Convention on Biological Diversity, adequately address the welfare of the species they seek to conserve. While the OIE provides guidance on animal health and welfare standards for common agricultural species, it has provided limited guidance for the farming of wild species. China's wildlife farming industry has been linked with the spread of COVID-19 but, to date, China has introduced few national welfare controls to protect the health of wild animals bred for human consumption. In the wake of COVID-19, these omissions must be remedied to provide appropriate safeguards to ensure animal health and welfare and protect public health.

AB It is widely recognized that the conservation of the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) in their wild habitats is fundamental to ensure the continuous supply of novel genetic material, crucial for future crop improvement. Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) and V. subterranea (bambara groundnut) are amongst the most significant African legumes as sources of food and fodder. In this study we investigated the diversity of Vigna species in Angola, to identify hotspot areas for their in situ conservation, and thus underpin future food security in SubSaharan Africa. Based on four criteria (i.e. potential utilization for crop improvement, threat status, ethnobotanical value, and geographical distribution) we prioritize Vigna CWR for conservation actions in Angola. Our results reveal that 28 Vigna species occur in Angola, two of which are endemic (V. mendesii and V. ramanniana). These species are unevenly distributed across the country, with greater dominance in the central-north and western areas, where four hotspot areas (Saurimo, Serra da Chela, N'dalatando, and Huambo) are identified. However, significant gaps in the current in situ conservation strategies are highlighted by our results, since the CWR diversity hotspots remain unprotected and only nine of the 28 Vigna species are recorded in protected areas. Moreover, in light of the fact that only one accession of Vigna collected in Angola exists in genebanks globally at present, we recommend a targeted seed collecting programme to support future management and ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources in Angola. Our study calls attention to the fact that Angola, together with Zambia, has the highest Vigna species richness in SubSaharan Africa, and provides new data and tools for the sustainable use of these species in crop improvement.

AB The effects of natural processes on deposited mineral material of postindustrial sites is underestimated. Natural vegetation development on mineral material substratum is an unappreciated way of site management. Due to the classification-based approach to assembly of plant community diversity, remote sensing methods have limited application. We aimed to assess whether remotely sensed data allow for building predictive models, able to recognise vegetation variability along the main gradients of species composition. We assessed vegetation in 321 study plots on four coal-mine spoil heaps in Silesia (S Poland). We determined the main gradients of species composition using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and we identified how DCA scores describe vegetation variability. DCA axes explained 38.5%, 35.4%, 31.4%, and 20.1% of species composition variability. We built machine learning models of DCA scores using multispectral satellite images and airborne laser scanning data as predictors. We obtained good predictive power of models for the first two DCA axes (R-2 = 0.393 and 0.443, root mean square errors, RMSE = 0.571 and 0.526) and low power for the third and fourth DCA axes (R-2 = 0.216 and 0.064, RMSE = 0.513 and 0.361). These scores allowed us to prepare a vegetation map based on DCA scores, and distinguish meadow-like from forest-edge-like vegetation, and to identify thermophilous and highly productive vegetation patches. Our approach allowed us to account for species composition gradients, which improved remote sensing-based vegetation surveys. This method may be used for planning future management.

AB One of the most effective factors in the sustainability of national parks (NPs) is the identification and determination criteria and indicators of the evaluation of environmental, economic and social NPs. The purpose of this study is the identification, customization, weighting, prioritization of criteria and indicators of NPs evaluation for determination of potential of environmental, economic and social services of Kiasar National Park (KNP). In the study, we used the Delphi questionnaire to identify criteria and indicators of the evaluation of environmental, economic and social NPs and entropy method to calculate their weight. Also multicriteria decision making such as an order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simple additive weighting (SAW) method were used for the prioritization of criteria and indicators for the evaluation of environmental, economic and social NPs. For this purpose, we evaluated the KNP in northern Iran. In this study, we identified eight criteria and 141 indicators including five environmental criteria with 91 indicators, economic criteria with 20 indicators, social criteria with 20 indicators and political criteria with 11 indicators. Finally, for customization of criteria and indicators, 42 indicators were rejected and eight criteria and 99 indicators including 66 environmental, seven economic, 15 social and 11 political indicators were accepted for NPs evaluation. The results showed that the most and least number of indicators was related to environmental and economic indicators, respectively. Also, the results of weighting criteria showed that protective and environmental functions' criterion with weight (0.217) and conservation of biodiversity with weight (0.140) had the highest weight for the evaluation in environmental, economic and social services of NPs. Also the results of prioritization criteria with TOPSIS and SAW methods expressed that protective and environmental functions and conservation of biodiversity point of view environmental criteria had a higher priority than other criteria. The results indicate that Kiasar National Park has sufficient potential to provide environmental, economic and social services.

AB Technological advancements in data collection and analysis are producing a new generation of ecological data. Among these, computer vision (CV) has received increased attention for its robust capabilities for rapidly processing large volumes of digital imagery. In marine ecosystems, the study of fish connectivity provides fundamental information for assessing fisheries stocks, designing and implementing protected areas and understanding the impact of habitat loss. While the field of fish connectivity has benefited from technological advancements, the extent to which novel techniques, such as CV, have been utilized has not been assessed. To inform future directions and developments, this study reviewed the current use of CV in fish connectivity research, quantified how the implementation of such technology in fish connectivity research compared with other areas of marine research and described how this field could benefit from CV. The review found that the use of remote camera systems in fish connectivity research is increasing, but the implementation of automated analysis of digital imagery has been slow. Successful implementation and expansion of CV frameworks in aquaculture and coral reef ecology suggest that CV techniques could greatly benefit fish connectivity research. A case study of potential use of CV in fish connectivity research, scaling up optimal foraging models to predict marine population connectivity, highlights how beneficial it could be. The capacity for CV techniques to be adopted alongside traditional approaches, the unparalleled speed, accuracy and reliability of these approaches and the benefits of being able to study ecosystems along multiple spatial-temporal scales, all make CV a valuable tool for assessing connectivity. Ultimately, these technologies can assist data-driven decisions that directly influence the health and productivity of marine ecosystems.

AB We study the mathematical properties of the quasi-dynamic ordinary differential equations defined empirically in Chen et al. (2019). In particular, we show how the allometric scaling mentioned in that work emerges naturally from the generalized Lotka-Volterra model under the quasi-dynamic ordinary differential equations paradigm. We then define and study the proportional quasi-dynamic ordinary differential equations and discuss the relationship of this equation system to both the classical and discrete time replicator dynamics. We prove asymptotic properties of these systems for large and small populations and show that there exist populations for which the proportion of the population varies cyclically as a function of total logarithmic population size.

AB The basic attitude of Chinese law towards wildlife resources is differentiated protection plus rational utilizations. Artificial breeding of terrestrial wildlife was a big business and a way to alleviate poverty, but also raised concerns over wildlife conservation and public health. China's complete ban on the consumption of terrestrial wildlife, whether wild-sourced or artificially bred, was a drastic change of China's legal regime on wildlife conservation and commercial artificial breeding. This change will have impacts on the drafting of a new Biosafety Law and the revision and enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Law, the Husbandry law, the Fisheries Law, and the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law.

AB Deep roots have long been thought to allow trees to coexist with shallow-rooted grasses. However, data demonstrating how root distributions affect water uptake and niche partitioning are uncommon. We describe tree and grass root distributions using a depth-specific tracer experiment six times over two years in a subtropical savanna, Kruger National Park, South Africa. These point-in-time measurements were then used in a soil water flow model to simulate continuous water uptake by depth and plant growth form (trees and grasses) across two growing seasons. This allowed estimates of the total amount of water a root distribution could absorb as well as the amount of water a root distribution could absorb in excess of the other rooting distribution (i.e., unique hydrological niche). Most active tree and grass roots were in shallow soils: The mean depth of water uptake was 22 cm for trees and 17 cm for grasses. Slightly deeper rooting distributions provided trees with 5% more soil water than the grasses in a drier season, but 13% less water in a wetter season. Small differences also provided each rooting distribution (tree or grass) with unique hydrological niches of 4 to 13 mm water. The effect of rooting distributions has long been inferred. By quantifying the depth and timing of water uptake, we demonstrated how even small differences in rooting distributions can provide plants with resource niches that can contribute to species coexistence. Differences in total water uptake and unique hydrological niche sizes were small in this system, but they indicated that tradeoffs in rooting strategies can be expected to contribute to tree and grass coexistence because 1) competitive advantages change over time and 2) plant growth forms always have access to a soil resource pool that is not available to the other plant growth form.

Although meta-analyses are important for quantitative synthesis across ecosystems, detailed comparisons of natural history and species interactions also illuminate convergence among systems. We compare the ecology of superficially dissimilar African savannas and coral reefs via shared characteristics including: (1) hyperdiverse guilds of large vertebrate herbivores and predators, (2) similar mechanisms driving positive feedback loops between herbivory and primary production, (3) similar roles of disturbance and herbivory in mediating ecosystem state, and (4) numerous smaller vertebrate and invertebrate species that underpin diversity and ecosystem processes. Our goal in comparing the natural history and ecology of these ecosystems is to facilitate others in finding their own comparative systems. We encourage scientists, especially early-career scientists, to explore ecosystems other than their primary focus. Whatever your ecosystem of study, examining the ecology of its analog in another environment may enliven your career.

AB Aims There is a trend of increasing woody biomass in tropical savannas. Here we ask what effect this increase may have on soil carbon pools and fluxes. Methods Using a field experiment we determine the amount of soil carbon directly under grasses, a juvenile tree among grasses and a juvenile tree with no grasses. We also measure CO(2)efflux at the soil surface and use gas wells to extract CO(2)from several soil depths. Results Our results show that grasses contribute substantially more than trees to both soil carbon and soil respiration. Grasses also make a disproportionate contribution to the delta C-13 value of SOC in the tree only treatments. The surface gas efflux data show that soil respiration increased with an increase in volumetric soil moisture and temperature and plots with both grasses and trees had higher respiration rates than plots with trees only or with grasses only. Conclusions The highest soil respiration is in the top 20 cm of the soil with grasses the primary contributors to both delta(13)C(SOC)and delta C-13(R). Any increase in woody biomass will result in a decline in SOM turnover and nitrogen mineralization rates resulting in higher SOC pools. The associated increases in SOC and above ground biomass will however be associated with negative economic and biodiversity impacts.

TI Trends in illegal wildlife trade: Analyzing personal baggage seizure
   data in the Pacific Northwest
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAFFICKING; GUIDE; PETS
AB The illegal import of wildlife and wildlife products is a growing concern, and the U.S. is one of the world's leading countries in the consumption and transit of illegal wildlife and their derivatives. Yet, few U.S. studies have analyzed the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) on a national or local scale. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have specifically examined the trends associated with IWT moving through personal baggage. This work aimed to better understand the magnitude of illegal wildlife importation into U.S. ports of entry by determining trends associated with illegal wildlife products from personal baggage seizures, using the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as a specific case study. To identify the most influential factors determining the numbers and types of personal baggage seizures into PNW, we analyzed 1,731 records between 1999 and 2016 from the Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) database. We found five significant contributors: taxonomic classification of wildlife, categorical import date, wildlife product, source region, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) status. While wildlife seizures across taxonomic categories have generally decreased in the PNW since 2008, other findings provide a reason for concern. More specifically, mammals were identified as the largest animal group of seized wildlife, and temporal trends indicate increases in seizures for this and several other taxonomic groups. Many of the seizures originated from overseas, with East Asia serving as the largest source. Our PNW case study can be a model for how large-scale geographical seizure data can be used to inform about the major factors that have historically and presently contribute to IWT, with conservation implications globally.

AB Understanding how tropical tree phenology (i.e., the timing and amount of seed and leaf production) responds to climate is vital for predicting how climate change may alter ecological functioning of tropical forests. We examined the effects of temperature, rainfall, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on seed phenology of four dominant species and community-level leaf phenology in a montane wet forest on the island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai using monthly data collected over similar to 6 years. We expected that species phenologies would be better explained by variation in temperature and PAR than rainfall because rainfall at this site is not limiting. The best-fit model for all four species included temperature, rainfall, and PAR. For three species, including two foundational species of Hawaiian forests (Acacia koa and Metrosideros polymorpha), seed production declined with increasing maximum temperatures and increased with rainfall. Relationships with PAR were the most variable across all four species. Community-level leaf litterfall decreased with minimum temperatures, increased with rainfall, and showed a peak at PAR of similar to 400 mu mol/m(2)s(-1). There was considerable variation in monthly seed and leaf production not explained by climatic factors, and there was some evidence for a mediating effect of daylength. Thus, the impact of future climate change on this forest will depend on how climate change interacts with other factors such as daylength, biotic, and/or evolutionary constraints. Our results nonetheless provide insight into how climate change may affect different species in unique ways with potential consequences for shifts in species distributions and community composition.

AB Introduction: Metaproteomics is an established method to obtain a comprehensive taxonomic and functional view of microbial communities. After more than a decade, we are now able to describe the promise, reality, and perspectives of metaproteomics and provide useful information about the choice of method, applications, and potential improvement strategies. Areas covered: In this article, we will discuss current challenges of species and proteome coverage, and also highlight functional aspects of metaproteomics analysis of microbial communities with different levels of complexity. To do this, we re-analyzed data from microbial communities with low to high complexity (8, 72, 200 and >300 species). High species diversity leads to a reduced number of protein group identifications in a complex community, and thus the number of species resolved is underestimated. Ultimately, low abundance species remain undiscovered in complex communities. However, we observed that the main functional categories were better represented within complex microbiomes when compared to species coverage. Expert opinion: Our findings showed that even with low species coverage, metaproteomics has the potential to reveal habitat-specific functional features. Finally, we exploit this information to highlight future research avenues that are urgently needed to enhance our understanding of taxonomic composition and functions of complex microbiomes.

AB Background In Mediterranean mountain socio-ecosystems, both grazing by livestock and the dry season may influence tree regeneration. However, the relative contributions of these drivers are poorly known, even though present and future canopy composition might result from past and present variations in climate and herbivore density. This study aims to test how semi-feral cattle presence and season affect tree regeneration. Methods The study was conducted using permanent plots inside and outside a cattle exclosure in an old-growth Mediterranean forest. Saplings and seedlings were counted five times per year (winter, early spring, middle spring, summer, fall) and monitored over 7 yrs. Results Semi-feral cattle exclusion increased Acer, Fagus, Ilex, Pinus, Prunus and Quercus sapling densities and increased Acer, Fraxinus, Ilex, Quercus and Sorbus seedling densities. Interestingly, the dry season did not exert any noticeable effects on the sapling or seedling densities of any of the studied taxa. Discussion Semi-feral cattle presence may limit tree regeneration through taxon-dependent effects, which suggests that the current decrease in grazing livestock across the Mediterranean basin will modify recruitment processes and, likely, future forest composition. Conclusions Semi-feral cattle presence acts as a selective driver of tree community composition.

AB Competition for space directly affects the structure of the sessile benthic communities on hard substrates. On the Brazilian coast Palythoa caribaeorum is an abundant shallow water mat-forming zoantharian and has fast growth rates. The objective of the present study was to assess the zoantharian's biotic resistance by investigating changes in growth rates when interacting with the invasive sun corals Tubastraea tagusensis and T. coccinea on a tropical rocky shore in southeast Brazil. In the experimental design, eight blocks were arranged along the rocky shore where the growth treatment was applied with four different levels: empty, skeleton, live T. coccinea and live T. tagusensis. We opened up 10 x 10 cm(2) spaces in the P. caribaeorum mat into which treatments were transplanted with epoxy putty. Growth measures of the zoantharian were obtained using photographs. During the 184 days of the experiment, P. caribaeorum had the highest total growth rate in the empty treatment with an average value of 2.124 +/- 0.189 mm.mo(-1); the treatment with the lowest total growth rate was T. coccinea with mean value of 1.104 +/- 0.117 mm.mo(-1). The presence of T. coccinea influenced the growth rate of the zoantharian, unlike its congeneric T. tagusensis, which did not significantly influence the growth rate of P. caribaeorum. The negative interactions between P. caribaeorum and the invasive Tubastraea spp. were species specific in nature, and the native zoantharian exhibited quite some biotic resistance to the invasive species, especially to T. tagusensis. This was due to competition, probably mediated both through physical and/or chemical mechanisms and preemptive occupation of space. Growth rates of P. caribaeorum were dependent on the degree of competitive interaction as well as seasonal differences in light and/or temperature which remain to be elucidated. From a management perspective, the manual removal of Tubastraea spp. will allow native species such as P. caribaeorum to recover space and thus foster ecosystem recovery.

   Serengeti savannahs

AB 1. Although there is a well-known association between tree cover and soil texture in savannahs, the hydrological drivers of tree cover variation have not been systematically explored, particularly in parallel with factors such as fire, herbivory, and tree-grass interactions. The relationship between hydrological factors and tree cover is important for resolving the relative contribution of bottom-up versus top-down factors in structuring savannah vegetation.
   2. We quantified soil moisture dynamics across eight 1-km transects spanning tree cover gradients from open to woody savannah in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania using soil moisture sensors coupled with dataloggers. We mapped tree cover at two spatial scales through supervised classification of high-resolution satellite imagery. We simultaneously produced water retention curves in open and woody habitats within each transect to compare soil hydrological properties and to convert volumetric water content (theta) from dataloggers to plant-available water over the course of an annual cycle. We also quantified grass biomass at 100 locations per transect, estimated fire frequency from MODIS satellite data, and quantified herbivore occupancy with paired camera traps situated in open and woody habitats within each transect.
   3. We found a positive relationship between tree cover and soil moisture drainage rate, and found that open habitats had more negative water potentials than woody habitats for a given value of theta. In contrast, we found no evidence for a consistent relationship between grass biomass or fire frequency and tree cover. We found evidence for higher browser occupancy in woody than open habitats, but no habitat effects on herbivores as a group (browsers plus grazers), suggesting that herbivory is unlikely to be the dominant factor explaining variation in tree cover.
   4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that variation in tree cover is partly driven by hydrological (edaphic) factors unrelated to fire, herbivory, tree-grass interactions or mean annual precipitation at these spatial scales in Serengeti. We contrast our findings with previous work attributing tree cover shifts in Serengeti to precipitation gradients.

AB Diets affect the intestinal microflora, which in turn affects the growth performance and immune response on host. To study the effect of protein sources in formulated diets on the growth, immune response, and intestinal microflora of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii, two major protein sources (yeast powder-D1 and corn gluten-D2) were used in the preparation of two isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets. The pearl oysters were divided into two groups, namely, ED1 and ED2, which were fed with D1 and D2 indoors respectively. After 45-day culturing, ED1 had significantly higher growth performance and protease and amylase activities than ED2. ED1 also had significantly higher alkaline phosphatase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase activities and total antioxidant capacity. A 16S rRNA-based sequencing revealed that the main bacterial phyla in ED1 were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Bacteroidetes, which accounted for 97.70 % of the microbial population. Firmicutes were the main phylum in ED2 and accounted for 97.98 %. ED1 got significantly higher Sobs, Chao, ACE, and Shannon indices than ED2. ED1 achieved significantly lower Simpson index than ED2. Results suggested that diet with yeast powder as the major protein source promoted the growth, digestive activity, immune- and antioxidant activity, and intestinal bacterial diversity in pearl oysters. This study provides basic data with regard to the mechanism through which formulated diets enhance digestive tract health of shellfish under controlled conditions.

AB Urban habitats differ from their natural surroundings in various aspects, such as a higher temperature and a distinct species composition. It is therefore not surprising that animal behavior too differs between these habitat types. We studied the foraging and habitat selection behavior of a pit-building predator, a wormlion, originating from either an urban or a more natural site. Wormlions occur in nature under structures that provide shelter from sunlight and rain, such as caves, and are also common in cities, occurring under artificial shelters. Wormlions construct pit-traps to hunt arthropods, and the pits constructed by urban wormlions were larger than those constructed by wormlions from caves. Urban wormlions responded faster to prey falling into their pit, probably leading to a higher capture success. We suggest that these 2 findings indicate the higher investment of urban wormlions in foraging, resulting from the higher abundance of potential prey in the city. Urban wormlions were choosier regarding their preferred microhabitat. While both fine sand and shaded microhabitats were preferred by wormlions, urban wormlions demonstrated a greater preference for such conditions. We suggest that relocation is more likely to lead wormlions in cities to find microhabitats of a higher quality compared with wormlions inhabiting caves. This is probably due to the larger areas in the city available for wormlions. Wormlions from the caves possessed more lipids, suggesting that they employ a conservative growth strategy, intended to contend with the uncertainty of prey arrival, in contrast to the city, where potential prey are more abundant.

AB The global phenomenon of introduced species has caused serious, negative impacts on biodiversity and human productive activities. Often, introduced species become invasive and impact and modifies the availability of resources in native ecosystem. Cattle and wild boar are two species that have been introduced on all continents for food and sport hunting. Both species cause detrimental changes in ecosystem processes and biodiversity. Particularly in Patagonia, it has been shown in different studies that in isolation these species can cause damage to native plants, alter the structure of the soil and its processes. This study sought to assess and compare the ecosystem impacts of cattle and wild boar upon ecosystem structure and function in different scenarios with the presence of both, one or none of these focal species. Our study area is the Nahuel Huapi National Park where both species have significant presence on temperate forest. In order to evaluate the species impact we combined experimental and observational methods across sites with the presence of one species, both species, and sites without either species. Our data showed that sites with both species or only wild boar showed fewer impacts than expected. However, when cattle is presence, this species seriously threaten the native ecosystems by affecting plant biomass, reducing the shrub cover and number of native plants, and enhancing exotic plant species. Our study found no evidence to support of additive effects or impacts a between both species, but the presence of both cattle and wild boar could have an antagonistic effect or interactions through resource competition. Although cattle and wild boar are considered valuable socio-economic resources, we believe that the free-range populations of these mammals that inhabit temperate forests of Patagonia should have focused management plans that prioritize the control of cattle, to subsequently focus on the management of the wild boar.

AB We explored the perceptions held by subsistence farmers (living in communal lands within the CAMPFIRE programme area in northwestern Zimbabwe) towards the African lion (Panthera leo) and related conservation interventions undertaken by management authorities. Conceptually guided by the cognitive hierarchy, we used a semi-structured, face-to-face interview format to collect data across three different farming communities bordering Hwange and Zambezi National Parks. Ordinal regression models were used to analyse the data. Our results illustrate that farmers' perceptions towards lions were strongly negative and appeared to be associated with the geographic location in which the farmer lived, as well as the farmer's ethnic group. We also found that perceptions towards lions were not associated with specific livestock losses or to the potential benefits farmers received from wildlife conservation, e.g. school classroom blocks or road improvements. Instead, we suggest that fear of lions and perceived risk to livestock or human wellbeing may play a stronger role in shaping farmers' perceptions compared to actual livestock losses. Moreover, we suggest that sharing information across farmer social networks within a community area, along with the potential for media attention over sensational events, may also influence perceptions towards lions. Our results contribute a baseline dataset for future applied research in this area, and provide insight into developing locally-meaningful conservation interventions, including the type of information to be shared, channels for communication, and the benefits derived from participating in wildlife conservation.

AB The physical structures built by animals are considered extended phenotypes that reflect how organisms make decisions and deal with changes in their biotic and abiotic environment. We summarize the results of several studies on Myrmeleon crudelis, a neuropteran larva that digs pit-traps in the soil to capture small arthropods (mostly ants) in the tropical dry forests of Costa Rica. Specifically, we showed how this species responds to varying biotic and abiotic conditions with changes in the design and/or location of its pit traps. Several experiments and field comparisons indicate that: 1) antlions adjust the pit design according to the abundance and type of prey. When prey is scarce, antlions increased trap diameter, an architectural adjustment that enhances the probability of prey encounter. Antlions that experienced high prey abundance, but the prey easily escaped, then increased pit depth, an adjustment that increases the chance of prey retention; 2) soil compaction strongly reduced pit-trap size and abundance; 3) antlions preferred soils with high proportion of fine-particle size to build pits. In fine-grained soil, pit-traps are larger and more efficient to capture prey than traps in coarse-grained soils; and 4) pit-traps may also be affected through indirect effects of soil structure and vegetation cover. Areas with fine-soil presented less plant cover, and plant cover could be beneficial for antlions because it acts as a shelter against direct sunlight and rainfall, or it may represent a cost because it is a source of leaflitter falling in the pits. The works summarized here how trap-building predators can exhibit considerable flexibility in trap construction in response to various biotic and abiotic factors, emphasizing how the study of extended phenotypes can be a useful approach to better understand the flexibility of foraging behaviors.

AB Understanding the range of approaches available for assessing the impacts of agricultural changes at landscape scale is important when addressing local to global issues. Using a topic modelling approach, we reviewed the literature on impact modelling of agricultural landscapes. A search in Web of Science using the keywords model, agricultural systems and landscape yielded 1,975 hits, of which 514 papers met our selection criteria. The most salient terms fell within six groups: change, scale, pollution, biodiversity, practices and terms on biophysical/regulatory conditions. We identified four main topics: water quality, water quantity/energy crops, biodiversity and Integrated Assessment. Water management issues were more likely to be covered in North American researches, while issues related to Integrated Assessment were mainly covered in European studies. We found no relationship between topic and model type. We conclude that future integrated studies should consider the diversity of agricultural systems in governance of water and biodiversity issues.

AB This study investigates climate change adaptation and mitigation interventions within the framework of green economy for sustainable development and poverty eradication in the Middle Zambezi Biosphere Reserve, Zimbabwe. The study adopted a mixed methods approach, mainly drawing data from field observations, focus group discussions (FGDs) drawing representatives from a household survey and key informant interviews. Primary data were collected in April and August 2015 from FGDs whose participants were derived from household heads who had previously participated in a broader climate change study. Key informant interviews were also held with traditional leaders, local experts and managers in the wildlife sectors. This was supplemented with data from secondary sources. Findings from the study indicate that stakeholders in the biosphere reserve implement green economy and climate change-related programmes and projects. Results also indicate that the biodiversity- and/or wildlife-related laws and policies developed prior to 2010 do not directly mention the term green economy and climate change yet these indirectly address the green economy agenda. However, recent soft law documents (post 2010) such as the Zimbabwe's National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2013-2020) and local councils' strategic plans prioritise climate change adaptation, mitigation and green economy-related issues. Although the wildlife sector has green economy-related initiatives in place, there exists a gap in terms of mainstreaming the green economy concept in biodiversity-related policies.

AB Globally, the determinants of rangeland dynamics and sustainability have been debated for decades. This study sought to explain the drivers of rangeland ecosystems in semi-arid South Africa by examining the vegetation and soil conditions around animal drinking water points, and their implications for sustainable management and paradigm debates. For this purpose, we selected three land use systems (continuous-communal livestock farms, rotational-commercial livestock farms, and continuous-game reserves), with the livestock farms having either high or low stocking rates. Soil organic carbon (OC), bulk density (p?<?0.05), and soil compaction (p?<?0.0001) varied greatly at land scales, being greater in the communal farms or game reserves than the commercial farms. Within the communal farms, sites with high stocking rates showed higher (p?<?0.05) soil OC and bulk density than sites with lower stocking rates, but in the commercial farms, sites with high stocking rates had lower soil OC. Above ground grass biomass, and the abundance of highly desirable grass species were greater (p?<?0.001) in the commercial farms and game reserves. Our results conclude that equilibrium elements, importantly animal density and diversity, seemed to play a major role in soil and vegetation dynamics. We also observed variations in edaphic factors and rainfall across the land use systems and over seasons (rainfall). We assume that these non-equilibrium elements may also influence rangeland ecosystems. To confirm this, however, we recommend future studies to include comparable measures of the vegetation and soil, and their relations with edaphic and temporal long-term rainfall variability across the land use systems.

AB Many species live in spatially separated patches, and individuals can migrate between patches through paths. In real ecosystems, the capacities of patches are finite. If a patch is already occupied by the individuals of some species, then the migration into the patch is impossible. In the present paper, we deal with prey-predator system composed of two patches. Each patch contains a limited number of cells, where the cell is either empty or occupied by an individual of prey or predator. We introduce "swapping migration" defined by the exchange between occupied and empty cells. An individual can migrate, only when there are empty cells in the destination patch, Reaction-migration equations in prey-predator system are presented, where the migration term forms nonlinear function of densities. We numerically solve equilibrium densities, and find that the population dynamics are largely affected by nonlinear migration. Not only extinction points but also the responses to the environmental changes crucially depend on the patch capacities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Historical processes during the Quaternary are likely to have left a signature on the geographical distribution of intraspecific genetic variation. In particular, high genetic uniqueness could be expected within glacial refugia for multiple species. We aimed to test this for plants in China and whether multi-species hotspots of genetic diversity are good indicators of glacial refugia in this region. From chloroplast DNA haplotype data for 116 species we calculated two local genetic diversity metrics for each species: haplotype genetic richness and genetic uniqueness. From these two, only uniqueness could reliably identify refugia, whereas richness may indicate either glacial refugia or areas recolonized by genetic lineages from different refugia in the postglacial period. Our results suggest the occurrence of numerous cryptic refugia and their likely importance in the maintenance and evolution of the Chinese flora, and indicate that an approach that locates geographic hotspots of genetic diversity data can reliably identify refugia.

TI Track surveys do not provide accurate or precise lion density estimates

SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA English

ID POPULATION; AFRICA; ABUNDANCE
AB More than 60% of the world's large carnivore species are threatened with extinction. Enumerating species abundance is critical for assessing their conservation status in response to anthropogenic threats and environmental stochasticity. Track surveys are commonly used to estimate abundance and density of large carnivore species, including lions (Panthera leo), but their suitability for estimating species abundance has been challenged. Recently developed regression models for track surveys of African large carnivores offer improvements over previous density estimators but have not been independently validated. We conducted weekly track surveys for lions in southeastern Serengeti National Park during 2015-2016 and applied one of these recent regression models, comparing corresponding lion densities to an independent density estimate in 2015 derived from a repeated call-in survey conducted during the same season. We surveyed 3289 km for tracks in total with overall lion densities of 41.2 (95% confidence limits [CL] = 31.9-57.9)/100 km(2) in 2015 and 34.6 (26.8-46.0)/100 km(2) in 2016. Within year point estimates of lion density varied up to 56% among weeks, though 95% CLs overlapped. Overall annual CLs from the track survey in 2015 did not overlap with the 95% credible interval from the estimate of lion density using a repeated call-in survey (14.36 lions/100 km(2); 95% Crl = 9.04-29.31), suggesting overestimation of lion densities using track surveys in 2015. High between-year and among week variation in density estimates from track surveys suggests that lion use of roads for movement varied over time and that other factors (e.g., prey distribution, luminosity) influenced lion movements independent of road distributions. We recommend caution when applying current track survey methods for estimating lion density and support application of survey designs that include direct observation of lions (e.g., call-in surveys), account for imperfect detection in a spatially-explicit framework, and incorporate environmental variables (e.g., prey, land cover) that can influence lion space use and movements.

AB Questions In the changing climate scenario, the decline in precipitation is expected to alter water availability for plants, which in turn affects plant community structure and composition. The responses of community composition and structure to declines in precipitation are well documented in other biomes but remain understudied in water-limited savannas. Location A savanna ecosystem in southwest China. Methods We used a four-year (2014-2017) precipitation manipulation experiment to examine changes in herbaceous community composition and structure across the species, functional group and community levels under precipitation reduction. Results Precipitation reduction significantly decreased the average height and percentage cover of the herbaceous community, while increasing species richness and the Pielou evenness index. Precipitation reduction significantly decreased average height, percentage cover and relative abundance of graminoids and perennials, but increased those of forbs and annuals. Precipitation reduction prompted a shift in the dominant species of the herbaceous community towards Fimbristylis monostachya. Conclusions The results show that precipitation reduction changed the composition and structure of the herbaceous community of this savanna. Furthermore, they provide strong evidence that changes in herbaceous community structure and composition in response to the intensity and duration of precipitation reduction in this savanna exhibited relatively low thresholds, which suggests that the herbaceous community's response to a decline in precipitation was essentially nonlinear. These findings imply that even relatively small declines in precipitation may stimulate shifts in plant community structure and composition and affect the function and stability of savanna ecosystems.

AB Though complex networks have been widely applied in the research of chemistry, there is hardly any introduction about the establishment of networks using chemical bonds. In this paper, we consider chemical elements as a system linked by chemical bonds and create the undirected chemical bond network by abstracting nodes from elements and undirected edges from bonds. Connectivity, heterogeneity, small world and disassortativity of this network show the macro structural rationality of this system. The degree and k-order neighbors of an element, which represent the micro topology of this network, can be used to measure its chemical reactivity and detect how many kinds of compounds it can form. The similarity between two elements is measured by the Jaccard index and the VOS mapping technique, results of which are similar to well-known similarities between elements shown by the periodic table. The establishment and topological analysis of this network provide another way to understand and study elements and bonds, and more chemical properties of elements and bonds can be studied by complex networks.

AB Extensive farming is an important source of food and fibre and often the only viable land use in the more arid regions of the globe. Yet, land use transformation for livestock grazing can lead to natural habitat degradation and fragmentation, identified as the main threats to biodiversity worldwide. Understanding which species are "winners" (i.e. species with a higher relative abundance index on farmland than protected area) and "losers" (i.e. species that have been extirpated or have a lower relative abundance index on farmland) in farming landscapes is crucial for the global sustainability of food production and biodiversity conservation. We used camera traps across 332 locations, over 23,796 trap nights to compare species richness and several aspects of community diversity (evenness, dominance, functional diversity and community structure) on 22 extensive small-livestock farms and a nearby protected area in the semi-arid region of the Karoo, South Africa. Species richness was not significantly different between the two land uses, but there were important differences in community structure and composition. Large carnivores were the "losers" of extensive livestock farming. Farmland displayed a lower effective number of species and functional diversity and a higher dominance than the protected area. The latter had a positive influence on the presence of large mammals and on the relative abundance of the region's main mesopredator, the black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas). Contrary to consensus, extensive small-livestock farming may be beneficial to some species and may therefore represent an important opportunity for biodiversity conservation outside of formally protected areas.

AB Conflicts over natural resource use and management often arise where groups have different goals or priorities. The media can play an important dual role in these conflicts; article content might offer insights about public opinion, whilst media may shape debates and how issues are perceived by the public and decision-makers. Wildlife farming is a contentious conservation tool attracting the attention of worldwide media, and associated conflicts among different interest groups may undermine its applicability. We investigated the media's portrayal of the Cayman Turtle Farm (CTF), a facility in the Cayman Islands which breeds green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) for human consumption, to investigate how the media presents information about wildlife farming (i.e. framing), consider its potential roles influencing conflicts and explore how it can be used for conservation conflict management. Content analysis was used to compare framing, article valence, and stakeholder representation in 634 newspaper articles from the international and local media. These media stories were framed in terms of: tourism, conflict, conservation, culture/community, management, and utilisation. International articles most often described CTF as a tourism facility. However, during a media campaign by an international animal welfare group, CTF was also often depicted as a source of controversy. Trade in turtle products was mostly debated in older articles. Local media mainly had a financial focus. Conflict framing was associated with a negative article valence, and conflict framed articles were significantly more likely to contain no conservation information. Mentions of environmental interest groups were significantly associated with negative articles, whereas academics were significantly more likely to be mentioned in positive articles. Conservationists must consider stakeholder objectives from the outset of interventions and be aware of the multiple roles the media might play. Media analysis and effectively harnessing the potential of media outlets should be considered as tools for managing conservation conflicts.

AB The Eastern Canadian northern shrimp population, representing one of the most important fisheries in the region, decreased dramatically since the mid-2000s to a historical low in 2017, but changes were not spatially uniform. Applying a biophysical model within Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) management areas, we investigated connectivity processes during the long pelagic larval phase (2-3 months) of Pandalus borealis and key drivers of larval dispersal in different environmental conditions. We selected 3 years representative of contrasting North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phases to assess potential larval dispersal patterns of the northern shrimp population in NL, and hierarchically assessed the impact of the timing of release (yearly and daily), release location, and vertical migration behaviour on shrimp larval dispersal. Overall, we found that populations located on the northern Newfoundland and Labrador shelf supplied potential settlers to southern populations because of the dominant Labrador Current. Ocean circulation and current velocities during the NAO positive year differed from other years, generating contrasting settlement spatial patterns. Larval release location and vertical migration behaviour were the two most important influences on the strength of larval supply and settlement patterns. Inclusion of diel and ontogenic swimming behaviour increased settlement success of larvae released from inshore areas, regardless of study years. Our study improves understanding of northern shrimp stock-recruitment relationships, their sensitivity to changing environmental conditions, and spatially non-homogeneous population decline for bentho-pelagic species with a long larval phase, which could potentially help improve management strategies.

AB Sustainable conservation aims to ensure the sustained conservation of landscape multi-functionality which in turn requires ensuring ecosystem service (ES) and habitat quality (HQ) sustainability with inclusive landscape-scale conservation planning. This study proposes a landscape conservation planning (LCP) framework for landscape-scale ES-HQ conservation and sustainability. Spatially explicit hotspots for five ESs and HQs are identified via InVEST and LISA software. Spatiotemporal changes in ES-HQ hotspots, in terms of stability and resilience, are delineated. The Zonation technique is applied to prioritize areas for conservation based on ES-HQ hotspot stability and resilience maps. High priority conservation areas are identified and are used as reserve area inputs for land use modeling with CLUE-S software to simulate future land use change under climate change scenarios. This study reports that varied rainfall and climate are major driving factors of ES-HQ sustainability disturbance in the study area. Furthermore, our proposed conservation Strategy 2 demonstrates that a larger extent of landscape multi-functionality can be sustained when the existing conservation area includes the total area of identified ES-HQ resilient hotspots. This study effectively identifies the stability and resiliency of ES-HQ hotspot areas affected by disturbances for high priority landscape conservation requirements to ensure ES-HQ sustainability and landscape multi-functionality in the study area.

AB While the fuelwood crises predicted in the 1980s have not materialized, the potential for fuelwood demand to exceed supply remains for many rural areas, particularly in Africa where fuelwood is the primary source of domestic energy. The sustainability of fuelwood harvesting from a semi-arid savanna ecosystem was investigated at a rural village where shortages have been predicted. Repeated sampling over a period of 7years revealed a stable supply of wood from harvesting areas. The number and thickness of stems harvested did not decline as expected, nor did the use of undesirable species. This is consistent with long-term changes in the structure of the woody layer of the harvesting area, where increases rather than decreases in plant density have occurred. The ability of local species to survive regular damage, coppice rapidly, and reproduce when still well below their adult sizes, together with social factors that limit the rate of harvesting, appears to have produced an ecologically sustainable harvesting system. However, the estimated biomass of fuelwood harvested was far below existing estimates of fuelwood consumption in the village, suggesting that fuelwood supply has not kept up with demand. Transformation of harvesting areas for housing and crop fields, rather than increasing demand, is the most likely cause of this.

AB Lake Abaya and Lake Chamo are the two largest Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes; they are located close to each other, but have a strikingly different water transparency. We explain key differences in the structure and the functioning of the food web with variation in limnological variables and major pelagic food web compartments within and across both lakes. Data from a detailed comparative investigation of physical and chemical variables and zooplankton community characteristics during the wet and dry season from two consecutive years revealed major differences in key limnological variables between Lake Abaya and Lake Chamo. The most pronounced differences were related to water transparency and the amount of suspended solids in the water column. Lake Abaya is much more turbid, has lower phyto- and zooplankton biomass, and has considerably lower primary production than Lake Chamo. Based on our results, we infer that the profound differences in food web structure between both lakes probably result from differences in sediment load. Finally, our results indicate that conservation programs should focus on reducing sediment inflow from the catchments into the lakes.

AB Renewable resources like fish stock or forests should be exploited at a rate that supports regeneration and sustainabilitya complex problem that requires adaptive approaches to maintain a sufficiently high exploitation while avoiding depletion. In the presence of oblivious agents that cannot keep track of all available resourcesa frequent condition in swarm roboticsensuring that the exploitation effort is correctly balanced is particularly challenging. Additionally, the possibility to exploit resources by multiple robots opens the way to focusing the effort either on a single or on multiple resources in parallel. This means that the swarm needs to collectively decide whether to remain cohesive or split among multiple resources, as a function of the ability of the available resources to replenish after exploitation. In this paper, we propose a decentralised strategy for a swarm of robots that adapts to the available resources and balances the effort among them, hence allowing to maximise the exploitation rate while avoiding to completely deplete the resources. A detailed analysis of the strategy parameters provides insights into the working principles and expected performance of the robot swarm.

AB ContextPlant invasions of native ecosystems are one of the main causes of declines in biodiversity via system-simplification. Restoring native biodiversity can be particularly challenging in landscapes where invasive species have become dominant and where a new set of feedbacks reinforce an invaded state and preclude restoration actions. We lack an understanding of the response of invaded systems to landscape-level manipulations to restore pattern and process relationships and how to identify these relationships when they do not appear at the expected scale.ObjectivesTo better understand how fire and grazing influence landscape-level heterogeneity in invaded landscapes, we assess the scale at which grazing pressure and seasonality mediate the success of re-introducing a historical disturbance regime, grazing driven by fire (termed pyric herbivory), to an invasive plant-dominated landscape.MethodsWe manipulated grazing timing and intensity in exotic grass-dominated grasslands managed for landscape heterogeneity with spring fire and grazing. In pastures under patch-burn grazing management, we evaluated the spatial and temporal variability of plant functional groups and vegetation structure among and within patches managed with separate grazing systems: season-long stocking and intensive early stocking.ResultsWarm- and cool-season grasses exhibited greater among-patch variability in invasive-plant dominated grassland under intensive early grazing than traditional season-long grazing, but landscape-level heterogeneity, as measured through vegetation structure was minimal and invariable under both levels of grazing pressure, which contrasts findings in native-dominated systems. Moreover, within-patch heterogeneity for these functional groups was detected; contrasting the prediction that among-patch heterogeneity, in mesic grasslands, manifests from within-patch homogeneity.ConclusionsIn invaded grasslands, manipulation of grazing pressure as a process that drives heterogeneous vegetation patterns influences native and non-native grass heterogeneity, but not heterogeneity of vegetation structure, within and among patches managed with fire. Fire and grazing-moderated heterogeneity patterns observed in native grass-dominated grasslands likely differ from invasive grass-dominated grasslands with implications for using pyric herbivory in invaded systems.

AB Despite of the widespread co-occurrence of multiple invaders, little is known on their combined ecological impacts and on their effects on different life stages of native species. We assessed the joint impacts of four non-native mammals (cattle, horse, European hare Lepus europaeus, and wild boar Sus scrofa) on seed surplus and seedling abundance of the Parana pine (Araucaria angustifolia), a critically-endangered species of the Atlantic Forest. We found that its seeds constitute an autumn food resource for a native community richer than previously thought, with 70 bird and mammal species as confirmed or potential seed consumers, of which 40 were not previously recognized as such. We also recorded the number of uneaten seeds and seedlings at the middle-end of autumn under 520 female Parana pine trees across the species' distribution and identified signs of the species consuming seeds from each tree through direct observations combined with camera trapping. Most of the sampled trees (98%) were visited by at least one seed consumer species, and over 60% were visited by at least one non-native mammal. Seed surplus strongly declined in the presence of cattle, horses and wild boars, their impacts being additive, whereas the number of seedlings declined in the presence of European hares. Our results emphasize the importance of Parana pine seeds for native fauna and the additive impact of invaders in a species-rich ecosystem. Seed predation by non-native species reduces the potential regeneration of Parana pine forests, and may severely reduce food supply for its native consumers.

AB Extensive coastal infrastructures built along the Chinese coastline have effectively created a new marine 'Great Wall' that has had a significant effect on the biogeography of intertidal species in the region by creating new habitat for colonization. Recent colonization by Nerita yoldii of the artificial rocky shores in the Yangtze River Delta has contributed to a northward shift of this species' range. Here, we study the range expansion and phylogeographic pattern of this species. Our four-year field survey showed a northward range expansion of N. yoldii on the artificial rocky shores. A phylogeographic analysis of populations from both artificial and natural rocky shores showed lower genetic diversity and fewer private haplotypes in newly colonized artificial shore populations. All the populations were clustered into three groups, one consisting of the three southernmost natural rocky-shore populations, a second that included all but one of the artificial-substrate populations and the two northernmost natural rocky-shore populations, and a third that included the offshore artificial-island population. These results indicate that N. yoldii has rapidly expanded its northern distribution limit and that the coastal artificial structures, together with increasing SST in the Yangtze River Delta, have played a crucial role in this range expansion.

AB The German yellowjacket (Vespula germanica) is an opportunist predator and a scavenger, whose eclectic diet also includes honey, brood, dead and live honey-bees. There is no evidence in this species of coordinated attacks against bees involving other conspecifics, although intraspecific competition has been already reported between two or more individuals during feeding. Our aim was to gain further knowledge on the feeding behavior of V. germanica in order to evaluate its role in an apiary. Sight observations of predation and necrophagy behaviors were carried out at the ground level near hives. We also investigated how intraspecific competition can influence the feeding display in this species. Our results confirm the major role of the German yellowjacket as a scavenger, because its diet is based mostly on bee carrions. Intraspecific competition during feeding was sometimes observed. When these events occurred, the interference of another wasp led to the bee escaping only in three cases. Our study also revealed that intraspecific competition events increase when the resource is fresh (predation vs necrophagy), and that the number of competing wasps was significantly higher when the food consisted of pupae and drones, compared to adult bees. When competition involved two individuals (the most frequent case), the winner was frequently the first wasp to reach the resource in both predation and necrophagy events. This suggests that the energy invested in foraging or predating activity and in defence of prey is usually rewarded.

AB Urchins are ubiquitous components of coral reefs ecosystems, with significant roles in bioerosion and herbivory. By controlling urchin densities, triggerfishes have been identified as keystone predators. However, the functional linkages between urchins and triggerfishes, in terms of distributional patterns and concomitant effects on ecosystem processes, are not well understood, especially in relatively unexploited systems. To address this we censused urchins and triggerfishes on two cross-shelf surveys on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) at the same times and locations. We also evaluated the role of urchins in bioerosion. Although urchin abundance and triggerfish biomass varied by 80% and nearly 900% across sites, respectively, this variability was driven primarily by shelf position with no evidence of top-down control on urchins by triggerfishes. Low urchin abundances meant urchins only played a minor role in bioerosion. We highlight the potential variability in functional links, and contributions to ecosystem processes, among regions.

AB This study evaluates how a modelling approach to determine areas of suitable habitat for the Critically Endangered Albany cycad Encephalartos latifrons can assist in systematic conservation planning for this and other rare and threatened cycads. A map distinguishing suitable from unsuitable habitat for E. latifrons was produced and important environmental predictors (climate, geology, topography and vegetation) influencing the suitable habitat were estimated. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling technique was chosen for this study as it has consistently performed well compared with alternative modelling methods and is also an appropriate model choice when the sample size is small and locality records are relatively few. Predicted habitat suitability showed that some locations chosen for translocation and restoration of E. latifrons specimens are not suitable. This revealed that modelling suitable habitat can guide relocation and regeneration of E. latifrons and perhaps other threatened cycads with restricted distributions and few locality records. The species distribution model constructed for E. latifrons is the first reported habitat model for a Critically Endangered cycad in South Africa. The results may be incorporated into conservation planning and structured decision-making about translocations and restoration programmes involving vulnerable cycads, which are among the most threatened organisms globally.

AB Scientists do not know precisely how severe will be the impact of climate change on species. Evidence suggests that for some species, their future distributions might be jeopardized by local extinctions and drought-induced tree mortality. Thus, we require models capable of estimating drought tolerance across many species. We can approach this goal by assessing functional traits. The trait osmotic potential at full turgor, (O), is potentially a good drought indicator; however, few studies address its importance as a drought-tolerance predictor and it is difficult to measure in the field with accuracy. In this work, we aim to answer the questions: which drought traits correlate with (O)?; do morpho-anatomical traits correlate with (O)?; and which trees and shrubs are more (or less) vulnerable to drought? To achieve this aim, we assessed physiological and morpho-anatomical traits for 14 native species from New Zealand forests. We included leaf- and wood-related traits, (O), water potential and stomatal conductance. We examined how these traits correlate with (O) and sought to generate models to predict (O) as a function of other traits. We tested 33 different models and evaluated them using Akaike's information criterion. Unfortunately, none of the morpho-anatomical traits correlated well with (O). Instead, water potential correlated most strongly with (O). None of the models using only morpho-anatomical traits produced plausible results. The model with the best predictive performance incorporated the effects of both morpho-anatomical and physiological traits: water potential and wood saturated water content. Of the species analysed, and based on their (O) response, Lophozonia menziesii was considered the most vulnerable to drought stress, whereas Plagianthus regius was the least vulnerable. Our findings imply that it is potentially valuable to keep exploring the use of (O) as a drought indicator and that the effort required to measure some physiological traits, such as water potential, may be essential to consider plant drought responses and to predict (O).

AB Understanding vegetation-modern pollen relationships is essential to provide confidence in fossil pollen reconstructions of long-term vegetation changes in savanna ecosystems. In this paper we compare the taxonomical composition and the diversity (Hill NO, N1, N2) of vegetation and modern pollen along precipitation and local grazing-intensity gradients in Namibian savannas. Modern pollen was extracted from surface soil samples collected from 5 x 5 m plots distributed along four 500 m gradients. Vegetation was surveyed in each plot. The results show a high correspondence between vegetation and pollen data in terms of composition. Precipitation and grazing explain a significant although low proportion of compositional change in the vegetation and pollen spectra. We identified pollen taxa as indicators of grazing pressure such as Limeum, Alternanthera, and particularly Tribulus. Correspondence between vegetation and pollen data in terms of taxa richness (NO) is limited, probably because of the influence of landscape heterogeneity and openness, as well as low pollen concentrations. In contrast, the effective numbers of common and dominant taxa (N1, N2) are consistent among the different datasets. We conclude that in spite of limitations, modern pollen assemblages can reflect changes in vegetation composition, richness and diversity patterns along precipitation and grazing gradients in savanna environments.

AB Background: Systematic conservation planning aims to ensure representivity and persistence of biodiversity. Quantitative targets set to meet these aims provide a yardstick with which to measure the current conservation status of biodiversity features and measure the success of conservation actions.
   Objectives: The conservation targets and current ecosystem status of vegetation types and biomes occurring in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) were assessed, and their level of formal protection was determined, to inform conservation planning initiatives in the province.
   Method: Land cover maps of the province were used to determine the amount of natural habitat remaining in KZN. This was intersected with the vegetation map and assessed relative to their conservation targets to determine the ecosystem status of each vegetation type in KZN. The proclaimed protected areas were used to determine the level of protection of each vegetation type.
   Results: In 17 years (1994-2011), 19.7% of natural habitat was lost to anthropogenic conversion of the landscape. The Indian Ocean Coastal Belt and Grassland biomes had the least remaining natural habitat, the highest rates of habitat loss and the least degree of formal protection.
   Conclusion: These findings inform conservation priorities in the province. Vegetation type targets need to be revised to ensure long-term persistence. Business-as-usual is no longer an option if we are to meet the legislative requirements and mandates to conserve the environment for current and future generations.

AB Olive tree is one of the most important crop at global scale. Apulia is the first olive-producing region in Italy, with a huge amount of farms that generate Integrated Pest Management (IPM) data. IPM requires the simultaneous use of different crop protection techniques to control pests through an ecological and economic approach. The crop protection strategies are correlated to the climate condition considering the very important relation among climate, crops and pests. Therefore, in this work is presented a new advanced On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) model integrating the Growing Season Index (GSI), a phenology model, to compare indirectly the farms by a climatic point of view. The proposed system allows analysing IPM data of different farms having the same phenological conditions over a year to understand some best practices and to highlight and explain different practices adopted by farms working in different climatic conditions.

AB Large terrestrial carnivores especially have experienced substantial declines in range and numbers. Changes in land use are a main driver of such declines, yet various developing countries have accelerated land use change through state-led land reform programmes. One of the most renowned land reform programmes is Zimbabwe's fast track land reform programme (FTLRP), which resulted in fast and compulsory subdivision of large commercial farms into indigenized small scale commercial and subsistence farms. Several case studies have shown an impact of the FTLRP on wildlife, however, its effect on wildlife populations at a nationwide scale remains largely unknown. Due to its wide-ranging nature, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is particularly vulnerable to changes in land use. In this study I used questionnaire survey and citizen science data to determine the population status and distribution of the cheetah 15 years after introduction of the FTLRP. I also assessed the level of human-cheetah conflict, and attitudes of commercial and subsistence farmers towards cheetah. I found dramatic range contractions and population declines, particularly in the landscape outside protected areas. Despite minimal conflict, subsistence farmers were less tolerant to cheetah than commercial farmers. Consequently, land reform is likely to have increased the hostility of the cheetah landscape outside protected areas. This study is one of the most comprehensive species assessments to date. It provides valuable empirical data on the implications of land use change and emphasizes how a lack of knowledge impedes our ability to recognize a species vulnerability to (local) extinction risk.

AB Although wetlands provide an important range of environmental, social and economic services, they are increasingly subjected to anthropogenic perturbations, amongst which invasion by alien plants is particularly alarming. This paper focuses on the alien flora of wetlands from three territories belonging to the western Mediterranean area: one continental (Valencian Community) and two insular (Balearic Islands and Sardinia), providing a complete checklist for the three territories and a general comparison. In total, 380 alien taxa from 89 families have been reported, being the Valencian Community the area richer in taxa (312), followed by the Balearic Islands (151) and Sardinia (134). The invasive component includes 77 taxa, of which nine are common to the three territories - and have been recognised as the most invasive ones in Mediterranean islands and six are considered invasive worldwide (Ailanthus altissima, Arundo donax, Cortaderia selloana, Oxalis pes-caprae, Ricinus communis and Eichhornia crassipes). Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) revealed that the three territories do not show statistically relevant differences in relation to the alien species present in wetlands and their characteristics. The information on the characteristics of plants in similar habitats of the same biogeographic region provides a portrait of the current dimensions of the phenomenon in Western Mediterranean wetlands and is especially useful from the management perspective: its predictive value can be applied in establishing a prioritization of control measures of those most invasive species and will help screening new introductions with invasive potential.

AB Interactions among plant species via pollinators vary from competitive to mutualistic and can influence the probability of stable coexistence of plant species. We aimed to determine the nature of the interaction via flower visitors between Leucospermum conocarpodendron and Mimetes fimbriifolius, two shrubs in the Proteaceae that share many ecological traits and coexist on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. To assess the extent of pollinator sharing we analysed nectar properties and recorded the pollinator fauna, their behaviour and contribution to seed set. To test for competition via interspecific pollen transfer, we recorded the movement patterns of pollinators and quantified pollen loads. To determine the effect of co-flowering on visitation rates we recorded visits in stands that varied in the density of the two species. We found that the species produce similar rewards and share pollinating Cape Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer). Interspecific pollen transfer is avoided by placing pollen on different parts of the bird. Both species are visited by nectar-thieving Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea). Insects and autonomous self-pollination contributed little to seed set. Pollinator visits increased with conspecific density in both species, and the slope of the increase was steepest in the presence of high densities of the co-occurring plant species. Nectar thief visits also increased with conspecific density in both species, but the slope declined with increasing density of the co-occurring species. Co-occurrence enhanced pollinator visits and alleviated nectar robbing in both plant species, consistent with mutualisms. Mutualism within a trophic level is unusual, but may help to explain the stable coexistence of ecologically similar species.

AB The proposed approach to the study of regularities of spatial variability of plant cover and to mapping forest vegetation is illustrated by the example of European Russia. It is shown that remote sensing and GIS technologies require particular standards of plant cover classification and reflection in maps. The given principles of classification and compilation of explications for maps of forest cover enable an assessment of its status and dynamics and a comparison of materials of different scales. We use the ecological-phytocoenotic approach to classifying forest vegetation. The specified units correspond to the categories of the main classifications of plant cover used in Russian geobotanics. In our classification, we have verified some parameters and the semantics of the mapped units, using satellite images, for their definite identification and interpretation. The elaborated approach to the classification and mapping of forest cover is applied for the study of the diversity of spruce forests under different climatic conditions in two regions, where they occupy about 20% of the total area. The first example characterizes the northern taiga subzone of forests of eastern Fennos-candia in the center of Murmansk oblast, and the second one represents the subzone of broad-leaved-coniferous forest in the southwest of Moscow oblast.

AB Ant-plant protection symbioses, in which plants provide food and/or shelter for ants in exchange for protection from herbivory, are model systems for understanding the ecology of mutualism. While interactions between ants, host plants, and herbivores have been intensively studied, we know little about how plant-plant interactions influence the dynamics of these mutualisms, despite strong evidence that plants compete for resources, that hosting ants can be costly, and that host-plant provisioning to ants can therefore be constrained by resource availability. We used field experiments in a semiarid Kenyan savanna to examine interactions between the ant-plant Acacia drepanolobium, neighboring grasses, and two species of symbiotic acacia-ants with divergent behaviors: Crematogaster mimosae, an aggressive symbiont that imposes high costs to host trees via consumption of extrafloral nectar, and Tetraponera penzigi, a less-protective symbiont that imposes lower costs because it does not consume nectar. We hypothesized that by competing with acacias for resources, neighboring grasses (1) reduce hosts' ability to support costly C.mimosae, while having little or no effect on the ability of hosts to support low-cost T.penzigi, and (2) reduce sapling growth rates irrespective of ant occupant. We factorially manipulated the presence/absence of grasses and the identity of ant occupants on saplings and evaluated effects on colony survivorship and sapling growth rates over 40 weeks. Contrary to prediction, the high-cost/high-reward nectar-dependent mutualist C.mimosae had higher colony-survival rates on saplings with grass neighbors present. Grasses appear to have indirectly facilitated the survival of C.mimosae by reducing water stress on host plants; soils under saplings shaded by grasses had higher moisture content, and these saplings produced more active nectaries than grass-removal saplings. Consistent with prediction, survival of low-cost/low-reward T.penzigi did not differ significantly between grass-removal treatments. Saplings occupied by low-cost/low-reward T.penzigi grew 100% more on average than saplings occupied by high-cost/high-reward C.mimosae, demonstrating that mutualist-partner identity strongly and differentially influences demographic rates of young plants. In contrast, contrary to prediction, grass neighbors had no significant net impact on sapling growth rates. Our results suggest that neighboring plants can exert strong and counterintuitive effects on ant-plant protection symbioses, highlighting the need to integrate plant-plant interactions into our understanding of these mutualisms.

AB Mud from a temporary pool in Morocco was sequentially inundated and dried at the laboratory to follow the life history of Branchipus schaefferi. Once adult, each female was coupled to a male in order to study their life history and reproduction. The average percentage of hatching decreased during the successive inundations, presumably as an adaptation to the unpredictability of the habitat. However, there was no indication that the offspring of the first inundation would preferentially hatch during their first inundation too, neither was there any such preference in the offspring of the delayed hatchings. Each female reduced risk by spreading hatching time of her resting eggs over consecutive inundations. Eggs did not hatch all at the same moment, reducing the chance that a female's entire offspring would die before reaching maturity if the pool would dry out too soon. There was a significant difference between the mean value of the number of resting eggs produced by the females from a large clutch size, and those produced by females from a small clutch size. There thus appears to be a genetic base for the clutch size of females.

AB Many endemic large branchiopods inhabit ephemeral freshwater ecosystems, including California vernal pools. Hydroperiod, inundation length, has been well studied in these systems that cycle between aquatic and terrestrial phases, but species' responses to other ecological processes are still poorly known. For example, temporal (plant thatch from the previous terrestrial phase) and spatial (nutrient runoff) factors may have strong effects on emergence and population densities during the aquatic phase. We examined the effects of hydroperiod stability, thatch, and nutrients on the emergence and density of 4 vernal pool endemic species: Branchinecta lynchi (Anostraca), Linderiella occidentalis (Anostraca), Lepidurus packardi (Notostraca), and Cyzicus californicus (Spinicaudata). A full factorial mesocosm experiment was conducted which measured species densities, along with water quality variables. Hydroperiod and thatch differentially affected 3 of the 4 species based on emergence timing and life cycle. Treatments had effects on many water quality variables, and these variables were correlated with densities. These results highlight how hydroperiod stability along with other processes can affect large branchiopod species in temporary freshwater ecosystems. California vernal pools are a greatly reduced habitat rich in endemic and endangered species (including Branchinecta lynchi and Lepidurus packardi), and therefore, these results have implications for conservation and management.

AB Background: This study aims to assess the role that Pleistocene refugia, rivers and local habitat conditions may have played in the evolutionary diversification of three central African duiker species (Cephalophus dorsalis, C. callipygus and Philantomba monticola). Genetic data from geo-referenced feces were collected from a wide range of sites across Central Africa. Historical patterns of population genetic structure were assessed using a similar to 650 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region and contemporary patterns of genetic differentiation were evaluated using 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci.
   Results: Mitochondrial analyses revealed that populations of C. callipygus and P. monticola in the Gulf of Guinea refugium are distinct from other populations in west central Africa. All three species exhibit signatures of past population expansion across much of the study area consistent with a history of postglacial expansion. There was no strong evidence for a riverine barrier effect in any of the three species, suggesting that duikers can readily cross major rivers. Generalized dissimilarity models (GDM) showed that environmental variation explains most of the nuclear genetic differentiation in both C. callipygus and P. monticola. The forest-savanna transition across central Cameroon and the Plateaux Bateke region in southeastern Gabon show the highest environmentally-associated turnover in genetic variability. A pattern of genetic differentiation was also evident between the coast and forest interior that may reflect differences in precipitation and/or vegetation.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study highlight the historical impact of Pleistocene fragmentation and current influence of environmental variation on genetic structure in duikers. Conservation efforts should therefore target areas that harbor as much environmentally-associated genetic variation as possible in order to maximize species' capacity to adapt to environmental change.

AB AimsEnvironmental variability (e.g. in precipitation) has a large effect on vegetation dynamics, and this often makes it difficult to assess the recovery of vegetation after a disturbance. In this study, we assessed vegetation recovery trends in response to grazing exclusion while considering for the annual environmental variability.
   LocationTwo regions with highly variable precipitation: a steppe near Mandalgobi, in Mongolia's Central Gobi province, and a desert steppe near Bulgan, in Mongolia's South Gobi province.
   MethodsChanges in vegetation were observed along grazing gradients at the above two sites, and vegetation thresholds were identified. We established reference plots in pre-threshold areas along the grazing gradients. We removed the impact of livestock grazing at various locations along the grazing gradients by establishing exclosures, and investigated vegetation from 2005 to 2013. We developed a smoothed hierarchical model within a Bayesian framework, and examined the effect of grazing exclusion on vegetation, focusing especially on the extent of grass cover recovery. In addition, we compared soil nutrient conditions in the reference plots and inside and outside each exclosure along the grazing gradients.
   ResultsTemporal trends in the cover of perennial grass in each plot inside and outside of the exclosures largely coincided, irrespective of grazing intensity, and exclosure had no effect (Bulgan) or a negative effect (Mandalgobi) on vegetation recovery. Soil nutrient content was not significantly affected by exclosure at a given distance from the grazing source, but decreased significantly with decreasing grazing intensity. Thus, recovery of the land from a post-threshold state may not be apparent even after 9yr of grazing exclusion in environments with highly variable precipitation.
   ConclusionThe effect of exclosure duration on perennial grass cover was limited, even after controlling for environmental variability. Once a vegetation threshold has been crossed, merely removing livestock from the landscape may not be sufficient for that area to recover.

AB Many species of ants fall prey to pit-digging larval antlions (Myrmeleon spp.), extremely sedentary predators that wait, nearly motionless at the bottom of their pit traps, for prey to stumble inside. Previous research, both in the field and laboratory, has demonstrated a remarkable ability of these ants to rescue trapped nestmates, thus sabotaging antlions' attempts to capture them. Here we show that pavement ants, Tetramorium sp. E, an invasive species and a major threat to biodiversity, possess yet another, more effective, antipredator strategy, namely the ability to learn to avoid antlion traps following a single successful escape from a pit. More importantly, we show that this learned antipredator behavior, an example of natural aversive learning in insects, is more complicated than a single cue-to-consequence form of associative learning. That is, pavement ants were able to generalize, after one experience, from the learned characteristics of the pit and its specific location, to other pits and other contexts that differed in many features. Such generalization, often described as a lack of precise stimulus control, nonetheless would be especially adaptive in nature, enabling ants to negotiate antlions' pit fields, which contain a hundred or more pits within a few centimetres of one another. Indeed, the ability to generalize in exactly this way almost certainly is responsible for the sudden, and heretofore inexplicable, behavioural modifications of ants in response to an invasion of antlions in the vicinity of an ant colony.

AB In the "nest site lottery" mechanism, newborns form a pool of candidates and randomly drawn candidates replace the dead adults in their nest sites. However, the selection process has only been analyzed under the assumption of an equilibrium population size. In this study, we extend this model to cases where the population size is not at an equilibrium, which yields a simplified (but fully mechanistic) biphasic population growth model, where the suppression of growth is driven only by the availability of free nest sites for newborns. This new model is free of the inconsistency found in the classical single phase models (such as the logistic model), where the number of recruited newborns can exceed the number of free nest sites. We analyzed the stability of the stationary density surfaces and the selection mechanisms for individual strategies dpscribed by different vital rates, which are implied by the new model.

TI Plant species composition and diversity depending on piospheres and
   seasonality in the southern rangelands of Kenya
SO ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE Piosphere; Species composition; Shannon-Wiener diversity; Species
   richness; Rangelands
AB Introduction: Scarcity of water in the rangelands of Kenya has led to the introduction of piospheres. Previous research has however produced contrasting results on the effects of piospheres and seasonality on Shannon-Wiener's diversity index, and therefore, this information is still deficient. In this study, the impact of these piospheres on plant species composition, diversity, and richness was assessed.
   Methods: Vegetation sampling was done during both the long rains (April) and the dry season (August). Three piosphere types (dam, trough, and a seasonal river) were studied using 0.25 m(2) quadrats to sample vegetation at intervals of 20 m along 100-m transects. Four 100-m transects were used per piosphere (north, east, south, and west directions). Shannon-Wiener's diversity index was used to determine species richness and composition. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine if piospheric distance had an effect on species diversity, richness, and evenness using GenStat 15th edition.
   Results: A total of 22 grasses and 29 forbs were recorded in the study area. The most abundant grasses near the piospheres were Eragrostis tenuifolia (12.9%) and Cynodon dactylon (10.6%). E. tenuifolia is an increaser species and was therefore most abundant in areas of severe grazing while C. dactylon has been known to be tolerant to grazing. The most abundant forbs were Crotalaria brevidens (37.5%). The Shannon-Wiener diversity index significantly increased (F = 25.07, P = 0.001) with distance from the three piospheres owing to the high grazing intensity near the piospheres and was significantly different between piospheres, being higher (F = 10.05, P = 0.001) at 20 m from the river (1.2 +/- 0.1) compared to a similar distance from the dam (0.9 +/- 0.1) and the trough (0.8 +/- 0.2). This was probably because the trough was smaller in size compared to the other piospheres, thereby concentrating more grazing animals per unit area and causing a greater impact on plant species.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrated that species diversity, richness, and evenness were low near the piospheres due to heavy grazing. Similarly, the lowest species diversity, richness, and evenness were recorded near the trough compared to the dam and the river. This study therefore recommends that range reseeding and rest period be done to rehabilitate degraded areas and facilitate plant regeneration. Larger piospheres should also be used to minimize animal impact per unit area.

AB Variability in the availability of suitable prey (mainly nauplii stages of Calanus spp.) in the early life stages of cod is likely a significant contributor to the fluctuations in the year-class strength in the Arcto Norwegian cod stock. We have investigated the origin of the Lofoten shelf population of Calanus using a particle tracking model approach based on velocity fields simulated from 2002 to 2012. By performing backwards simulations of trajectories from particles released on the Lofoten shelf in early spring, we assessed the relative contribution of potential Calanus sources, such as the Lofoten Basin, the local overwintering on the continental shelf and the adjacent fjords. This analysis revealed significant interannual differences in advection patterns mainly driven by changes in wind conditions and variable strength of the Norwegian Coastal Current. Most of the particles advected into our study area originated on the shelf, and contrary to expectations, only a few originated from the Lofoten Basin where Calanus abundances tend to be high. These results suggest that contribution from the Lofoten Basin to the early spring shelf Calanus population may be overestimated and that contribution from more local sources, especially from adjacent fjords, may play a more important role than what has been previously anticipated. Our results highlight the necessity to improve quantification of shelf-fjord exchange processes, as these may contribute more to the regulation of spring zooplankton stocks on the northern Norwegian shelf, and, as a result, may affect the survival of cod larvae in this area.

AB In diverse tropical webs, trophic cascades are presumed to be rare, as species interactions may dampen top-down control and reduce their prevalence. To test this hypothesis, we used an open experimental design in the Galapagos rocky subtidal that enabled a diverse guild of fish species, in the presence of each other and top predators (sea lions and sharks), to attack two species of sea urchins grazing on benthic algae. Time-lapse photography of experiments on natural and experimental substrates revealed strong species identity effects: only two predator species-blunthead triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium) and finescale triggerfish (Balistes polylepis)-drove a diurnal trophic cascade extending to algae, and they preferred large pencil urchins (Eucidaris galapagensis) over green urchins (Lytechinus semituberculatus). Triggerfish predation effects were strong, causing a 24-fold reduction of pencil urchin densities during the initial 21 hours of a trophic cascade experiment. A trophic cascade was demonstrated for pencil urchins, but not for green urchins, by significantly higher percent cover of urchin-grazed algae in cages that excluded predatory fish than in predator access (fence) treatments. Pencil urchins were more abundant at night when triggerfish were absent, suggesting that this species persists by exploiting a nocturnal predation refuge. Time-series of pencil urchin survivorship further demonstrated per capita interference effects of hogfish and top predators. These interference effects respectively weakened and extended the trophic cascade to a fourth trophic level through behavioral modifications of the triggerfish-urchin interaction. We conclude that interference behaviors capable of modifying interaction strength warrant greater attention as mechanisms for altering top-down control, particularly in speciose food webs.

AB Land carrying capacity is an important index of evaluation on land resources. And the land carrying capacity is also very important for guiding regional plans and promoting sustainable development of regional economy. So it is significant to clarify the land carrying capacity in the sequence of events which helps the decision makers understand and grasp the knowledge of land carrying capacity more clearly and make the right judgment and decision. Based on the theory of population, resources, environment and economy, the method of reviewing literatures is used in this paper to summarize the theory of the land carrying capacity and the researching methods of the land carrying capacity, as well as the problems existing in the study of land carrying capacity.

AB In semiarid regions, livestock is concentrated around water sources generating a piosphere pattern (gradients of woody vegetation degradation with increasing proximity to water). Close to the water source, livestock may affect the composition, structure and regeneration strategies of woody vegetation. We used the proximity from a water source as a proxy of grazing pressure. Our objectives were (1) to compare woody vegetation attributes (richness, diversity, species composition, density and basal area) and ground cover between sites at two distances to a water source: near (higher grazing pressure) and far from the water source (lower grazing pressure), and (2) to quantify and compare cases of spatial association among the columnar cacti Stetsonia coryne (Salm-Dyck) Britton and Rose (Cactaceae), and the dominant tree Bulnesia sarmientoi Lorentz ex Griseb. (Zygophyllaceae). We used a paired design with eight pairs of rectangular plots distributed along a large and representative natural water source. Wefound lower total species richness, plant density and soil cover near than far from water source, and more cases of spatial associations between the two species studied. Our results show evidence of increased livestock impacts around water sources. However, we found no difference in terms of species composition or basal area at near versus far sites. We conclude that grazing pressure might be changing some attributes of the woody plant community, and that the association of young trees with thorny plants (grazing refuge) could be a regeneration mechanism in this semiarid forest with high grazing pressure.

AB Due to field enlargements and removal of landscape elements, intensification of agricultural management is frequently related to the alteration of the landscape structure and composition of elements, resulting in a decreased ecological capability. This study presents a spatially explicit probabilistic approach to model and analyse the effect of landscape elements removal on landscape connectivity and heterogeneity in a case study in North-Eastern Germany. Simulation of stepwise removal of tree elements as potential landscape changes is applied to assess resulting impacts on the related ecological habitat function for the red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), a representative farmland bird species. The analysis of variograms' parameters identified a turning point in landscape structure constellation, occurring at a removal of nearly 50% of the tree elements, in correspondence of a 21% reduction in heterogeneity and a 20% reduction in elements connectivity. In terms of habitat provision, the turning point appeared at a shifted level, corresponding to a 50% reduction of connectivity, resulting from a ca. 75% reduction in spatial variability. It is argued that at the turning points the agricultural landscape would reach the limits of its resilience in terms of the habitat function associated to the removed elements. Results, displayed as probability maps, highlight that a high probability of tree elements occurrence is not always coupled with a high probability of habitat provision. The approach offers planners the possibility to identify structural and functional resilience thresholds for the management of multifunctional agricultural landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biological traits of marine benthic species have important effects on the extent of larval dispersal. Yet, empirical characterizations of many of these traits, which are critical data for parameterizing models of larval dispersal, remain scant for most species, particularly corals. We characterized spawning, larval development, settlement dynamics, survival, and propagule buoyancy and vertical swimming behavior of the Caribbean octocoral Antillogorgia americana. Spawning of A. americana in the Florida Keys, USA, was associated with the lunar cycle and occurred over 2 separate events following the full moon of November 2014. Despite the rapid larval development (2-3 d) and onset of competency to settle at similar to 4 d, most larvae delayed settlement for an extended period of time, with 50% of the cohort transitioning to the benthos by 36 d, and 95% by 58 d. Larval mortality in the laboratory was surprisingly low (10% over 58 d). Egg buoyancy and larval swimming behavior were highly variable both within cohorts and over time. In particular, there was a significant decrease in propagule buoyancy during embryogenesis, which was gradually offset by the increase in larval swimming activity (similar to 3-4 d). Most larvae had negative geotactic behavior for up to 20 d. The observed capacity to delay settlement suggests the dispersal potential of A. americana is high, which undoubtedly contributes to its broad distribution in the Caribbean. Importantly, our results underline the inherent variation observed in these larval traits, particularly swimming behavior, which has potentially important implications for dispersal and may improve our understanding of connectivity.

AB The emergence and continued expansion of one of the most dangerous causes of biodiversity loss and habitat alteration such as invasive species at some Ramsar wetlands of the Southern Pannonia raise a series of questions of both an environmental as well as a legal character relevant to these fragile ecosystems. The Ramsar Convention provides a set of general instructions and guidelines, but it does not establish an adequate mechanism of sanctions that could be imposed on states or individuals who violate its provisions. Fully aware of the importance of wetlands and their wildlife for a healthy living environment and human welfare, the authors of this paper describe the present conditions of invasive plant species at some Ramsar Sites and briefly analyze the current legal framework for the implementation of the Ramsar Convention. Finally, the authors propose innovative normative solutions that would improve the protection of wetlands and contribute to the suppression and prevention of the presence of invasive species not only in this region, but also worldwide.

AB For marine benthos with planktonic larval stages, demographic metapopulation and empirical metacommunity studies are scarce. A sink nature, was shown for a local intertidal sandflat population of the, gastropod Umhonium moniliferum in an estuarine to coastal oceanic region in Amakusa, Kyushu, Japan. The gastropod has a 3-day planktonic larval duration (PLD). It inhabited 11 sandflats, which were shared by the ghost shrimp,Vihonoirypaea harmandi. The shrimp is a burrow-dwelling bioturbator with a 30-day PLD. On one sandflat (hereafter 150) in Amakusa, the density and distribution of the two species was monitored from 1979 to 2014. All their main local populations were surveyed in 1998. In July 1979, the gastropod and shrimp were distributed on the lower and upper zones of U0 separately, with mean densities of 1,740 and 170 ind/m(2). The gastropod population declined to extinction in 1986, associated with the increase in shrimp density to 440 ind/m(2) and distribution to the lowest shore. Shrimp sediment destabilization was most likely to inhibit gastropod recruitment. The gastropod population began to recover in 1997 owing to shrimp population shrink. The regional survey results showed that (1) eight local populations (U0 U7 sandflats) of the two species along a 25-kni shoreline of Amakusa, presumably, constitute each substantial metapopulation, and (2) their largest populations were at the shoreline opposite ends. These features would be generated by the interaction of species specific larval dispersal traits and shoreline physiography. The threshold shrimp density of 160 ind/m(2) precluding gastropod recruitment was detected from U1 U7. In 2001 and 2009, gastropod population density on UO reached respective peaks comparable to that in 1979. This population fluctuation was due to varying recruit abundance, which corresponded well with the year-to-year change in shrimp population density across that threshold. The recolonization of the UO gastropod population ought to be made by allochthonous larvae from the Ul U7 populations, especially U6 U7, suggesting a rescue effect in the source sink relationship. The degree of self-persistency of the UO gastropod population was estimated by calculating net reproductive rate (R-0) based on the parameters about pre-settlement larval return-home and survival rates and post-settlement juvenile and adult survival rates. The availability of data set restricted the estimation to potential R-0 for four year-segments, with each 1-y parameter set extrapolated to the gastropod 4-y life span. On U0 in 1979 to 1981, despite with minimum shrimp influences, the gastropod population could still be a demographic sink probably due, to a limited larval return-home rate and due to a low post-settlement survival rate of juveniles caused by epibenthic predation or storm for their first 1 y to reach sexual maturity.

AB Pygospio elegans is an opportunistic, wide-spread spionid polychaete that reproduces asexually via fragmentation and can produce benthic and pelagic larvae, hence combining different developmental modes in one species. We documented the density, size distribution, and reproductive activity of P. elegans at four sites in the Danish Isefjord-Roskilde Fjord estuary complex, where all modes of reproduction were reported. We compared population dynamics of this species to environmental parameters such as salinity, temperature, and sediment characteristics (grain size, sorting, porosity, water content, organic content, C/N). We observed that new cohorts-resulting either from sexual or asexual reproduction-appeared in spring and fall, and old ones disappeared in late summer and winter. Sexual reproduction occurred from September until May, and although their timing was variable, there were two reproductive peaks at three sites. At those sites, we also observed a switch in larval developmental mode. Asexual reproduction peaked in April. While the seasonal dynamics can be related to temperature to a large extent, the differences in population dynamics among sites also correlated with sediment structure and salinity. Populations from sites with coarse and heterogeneous sediment had high levels of sexual reproduction. At the site with lower salinity, intermediate and benthic larvae were present during winter in contrast to pelagic larvae found at the other sites. However, we could not identify one clear environmental factor determining the mode of development. At present, it remains unclear to what degree genetic background contributes to mode of development. Hence, whether the differences in developmental mode are the result of genetically different cohorts will be further investigated.

AB Restoration in seriously polluted streams has become an urgent issue in developing countries. In this study, we attempted to propose an effective restoration approach in a heavily polluted stream in China with the aid of relationships between ecosystem properties and landscape across multiple scales. Land cover and physical geometry at a fine gradient of spatial scales (doubling 60-960 m and whole catchment) were included as landscape predictive variables, while water quality and macroinvertebrate were involved as ecosystem response variables. The strong relationship between the stream properties and surrounding landscape indicated the stream still maintain its resilience, that is, the capacity to recover from disturbance without changing its fundamental functions and state, even undergoing severe pollution. Further, the primary predictors for water quality were agriculture and urban land, with most effective scale at local 60 m buffer, but independence tests pointed out most correlations between agriculture and water quality were attributed to urban land and spatial covariation. No direct association was detected between macroinvertebrate and surrounding land cover at all scales, but macroinvertebrate exhibited significant relationship with physical variables at in-stream habitat scale. Overall, it was quite possible for this heavily polluted stream to go back to its initial health state if appropriate restorations were taken. The extent and intensity of riparian urbanizations were high priority factors when performing water quality improvement, and increasing habitat complexity and heterogeneity at in-stream scale was crucial for increasing macroinvertebrates diversity.

AB Whether a species is rare or overabundant, accurate estimates of population abundance are essential for the development and assessment of conservation plans and management goals. Aerial surveys are commonly used to estimate population abundance and a variety of methods have been used to account for recognized biases associated with imperfect detection. Rarely addressed, however, is the possibility of recording duplicate observations and the influence of duplicate observations on estimates of abundance. Using data provided by Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared bison (Bison bison) and helicopter survey paths conducted during 2011-2013 in the Henry Mountains, Utah, USA, we determined whether GPS-collared bison were observed, missed, or observed multiple times. Using these data, covariates hypothesized to influence observation errors, and generalized linear models, we found the probability of detecting a GPS-collared bison (study-wide mean of 95%) was consistently greater for individuals in larger groups and less rugged terrain. We also found that the probability of recording a duplicate observation (study-wide mean of 4.4%) increased with time since the prior survey observation. By incorporating both types of observation error into a modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator, more accurate estimates of bison abundance can be attained, particularly in years when animals segregate into small groups, utilize terrain that makes them difficult to see, or have ample time to move into areas not yet surveyed and be counted again. Our approach of accounting for multiple sources of observation error can easily be applied to aerial surveys for other species in other systems, and has the potential to improve the rigor of wildlife abundance estimation from aerial surveys.

AB Forests with intensive management past are kept unmanaged to restore diversity and ecosystem functioning. Before perpetuating abandonment after protracted restitution, understanding its effect on forest vegetation is desirable. We studied plant diversity and its relation with environmental variables and stand structure in northern Indian unmanaged tropical moist deciduous forest. We hypothesized that post-abandonment species richness would have increased, and the structure of contemporary forest would be heterogeneous. Vegetation structure, composition, and diversity were recorded, in forty 0.1 ha plots selected randomly in four forest ranges. Three soil samples per 0.1 ha were assessed for physicochemistry, fine sand, and clay mineralogy. Contemporary forest had less species richness than pre-abandonment reference period. Fourteen species were recorded as either seedling or sapling, suggesting reappearance or immigration. For most species, regeneration was either absent or impaired. Ordination and multiple regression results showed that exchangeable base cations and phosphorous affected maximum tree diversity and structure variables. Significant correlations between soil moisture and temperature, and shrub layer was observed, besides tree layer correspondence with shrub richness, suggesting that dense overstory resulting from abandonment through its effect on soil conditions, is responsible for dense shrub layer. Herb layer diversity was negatively associated with tree layer and shrub overgrowth (i,e. Mallotus spp.). Protracted abandonment may not reinforce species richness and heterogeneity; perhaps result in high tree and shrub density in moist deciduous forests, which can impede immigrating or reappearing plant species establishment. This can be overcome by density/basal area reduction strategies, albeit for both tree and shrub layer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In the woodlands of the Central Monte desert (Argentina), phreatophyte vegetation is exposed to different levels of disturbance. Livestock and settlement activity produce mainly nutrient inputs and partial vegetation removal, with a consequent reduction on water use by vegetation. We hypothesize that because of the increased soil water and nutrient resources associated with livestock stations, water stress will be relieved for the remaining Prosopis flexuosa trees, favouring water and nutrient status, and plant growth at the plant scale. The goal of this research was to analyse the physiological responses of P. flexuosa trees that grow in interdune valleys under different land uses, and the changes in relative importance of environmental factors controlling these responses. We compared the ecophysiological responses of adult P. flexuosa trees in two contrasting types of disturbance: disturbed (livestock stations) and relatively undisturbed (control woodlands) stands, in the 2011-2013 growing seasons. Pre-dawn and midday leaf water potential and stomatal conductance were higher in livestock stations than in control woodlands, suggesting a better water status of P. flexuosa in livestock stations. Isotopic composition (lower delta C-13, and higher delta N-15) and foliar nitrogen concentration (lower C:N ratios) indicated lower water use efficiency and higher nitrogen absorption from the soil in livestock stations. Both growth of new leaves (foliar area) and the length of young branches were higher in the first season for both land uses, but branch length was higher in livestock stations. This is consistent with the idea that vegetation removal and nutrient contribution of settlement activities improved water and nutrient status of remaining vegetation, and modified the relative importance of factors controlling ecophysiological processes. We concluded that physiological responses and vegetative growth of P. flexuosa were not only affected by meteorological conditions (rainfalls, vapour pressure deficit), but also by the ecohydrological changes caused by changes in land use.

AB The trophic structure of Ascension Island's sub-tidal reef assemblages is poorly understood. Unlike other tropical reef systems, sub-tidal habitats have very low abundance of both coral and macrophyte species. Visually dominant is a diverse assemblage of fish species, with particularly high densities of Melichthys niger, a voracious omnivore. In contrast, the nocturnal species assemblage is notably different, visually dominated by benthic invertebrates. To quantify the difference between day and night visible assemblages, we conducted day/night pairs of transect surveys of fish and invertebrates across three depths, and spanning 9 months, assigning all species to one of 10 functional groups. Multivariate analysis of surveys revealed significant turnover in species between day and night surveys and between survey periods, with concomitant changes in species rank-abundance distributions. Juveniles of a number of fish species were determinate in observed differences. Conversely, diversity of functional groups between day/night surveys and between seasons were not different, however there was significant species turnover within functional groups between day and night assemblages. The lack of proportional change in functional groups but a turn-over of species between day and night assemblages suggest that there may be a degree of functional redundancy in Ascension Island's marine trophic profile. Further investigation into the spatio-temporal variation in trophic profile and functional diversity around the island will benefit conservation and fisheries management in this isolated and poorly understood marine system.

AB This study provides a broad understanding of vascular plant richness and community structure of mountain grassland (Matri) at Bandipora, Kashmir and links it various environmental variables. Employing a stratified sampling design, six sites were selected wherein vegetation was sampled by placing quadrats (n=210). Elucidating an important effect of topography and anthropic pressure, numerical classification -TWINSPAN segregated the quadrats into seven community types. Contrary to species rich communities which showed an explicit composition and localized distribution, the other communities depicted a vague composition and stretched unevenly between the lower and middle altitudes. Using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), elevation and disturbance were found as most influencing factors whereas steepness of slope, organic carbon, soil reaction (pH) and soil salinity (electrical conductivity) were other important factors. Indices of diversity measured at two measurement scales varied differently between communities and at a macro scale (site level) highest values were recorded in least disturbed communities. However, on a micro scale (quadrat level) the indices behaved differently. For effective conservation of these species rich grasslands, acknowledging the local level variability in vegetation structure is all but crucial.

AB The mechanisms that allow species to evolve, coexist, compete, cooperate or become extinct are becoming always more understood. At the same time, the factors that allow species to coexist in a given time within the same environment are still debated. Many theories and hypotheses suggest that competition tends to differentiate the ecological requirements after repeated interactions and to allow the presence of many different species in the same area (i.e. biodiversity). After all, a thorough understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of biodiversity, which could somehow explain the current distribution patterns and mechanisms of coexistence, must consider the biogeographic and phylogenetic approaches. Here I propose a new graphic model that reviews the past and present, and sometimes debated, trends in biodiversity and evolutionary science, pointing out the importance of the avoidance of competition, the biological history, the endogenosymbiosis and the three-dimensionality as the main forces that structure ecosystems and allow the evolution of biological diversity. This model is an attempt to explain and summarize some of the mechanisms that underlie the current presence of the awesome number of species that currently inhabit our planet.

AB The control of dominant, non-native trees can alter the water balance of soils in forest ecosystems via hydrological processes, which results in changes in soil water environments. To test this idea, we evaluated the effects of the mortality of an invasive tree, Casuarina equisetifolia Forst., on the water content of surface soils on the Ogasawara Islands, subtropical islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, using a manipulative herbicide experiment. Temporal changes in volumetric water content of surface soils at 6 cm depth at sites where all trees of C. equisetifolia were killed by herbicide were compared with those of adjacent control sites before and after their mortality with consideration of the amount of precipitation. In addition, the rate of decrease in the soil water content during dry periods and the rate of increase in the soil water content during rainfall periods were compared between herbicide and control sites. Soil water content at sites treated with herbicide was significantly higher after treatment than soil water content at control sites during the same period. Differences between initial and minimum values of soil water content at the herbicide sites during the drying events were significantly lower than the corresponding differences in the control quadrats. During rainfall periods, both initial and maximum values of soil water contents in the herbicided quadrats were higher, and differences between the maximum and initial values did not differ between the herbicided and control quadrats. Our results indicated that the mortality of non-native trees from forest ecosystems increased water content of surface soils, due primarily to a slower rate of decrease in soil water content during dry periods.

AB Species-specific enemies may promote prey coexistence through negative distance-and density-dependent survival of juveniles near conspecific adults. We tested this mechanism by transplanting juvenile-sized fragments of the brooding corals Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix 3, 12, 24 and 182 cm up-and down-current of conspecific adults and monitoring their survival and condition over time. We also characterized the spatial distribution of P. damicornis and S. hystrix within replicate plots on three Fijian reef flats and measured the distribution of small colonies within 2 m of larger colonies of each species. Juvenile-sized transplants exhibited no differences in survivorship as a function of distance from adult P. damicornis or S. hystrix. Additionally, both P. damicornis and S. hystrix were aggregated rather than overdispersed on natural reefs. However, a pattern of juveniles being aggregated near adults while larger (and probably older) colonies were not suggests that greater mortality near large adults could occur over longer periods of time or that size-dependent mortality was occurring. While we found minimal evidence of greater mortality of small colonies near adult conspecifics in our transplant experiments, we did document hot-spots of species-specific corallivory. We detected spatially localized and temporally persistent predation on P. damicornis by the territorial triggerfish Balistapus undulatus. This patchy predation did not occur for S. hystrix. This variable selective regime in an otherwise more uniform environment could be one mechanism maintaining diversity of corals on Indo-Pacific reefs.

AB Baited Underwater Video (BUV) systems have become increasingly popular for assessing marine biodiversity. These systems provide video footage from which biologists can identify the individual fish species present. Here we explore the relevance of spatial dependence and marine park boundaries while estimating the distribution and habitat associations of the commercially and recreationally important snapper species Chrysophrys auratus in Moreton Bay Marine Park during a period when new Marine National Parks zoned as no-take or "green" areas (i.e., areas with no legal fishing) were introduced. BUV studies typically enforce a minimum distance among BUV sites, and then assume that observations from different sites are independent conditional on the measured covariates. In this study, we additionally incorporated the spatial dependence among BUV sites into the modelling framework. This modelling approach allowed us to test whether or not the incorporation of highly correlated environmental covariates or the geographic placement of BUV sites produced spatial dependence, which if unaccounted for could lead to model bias. We fitted Bayesian logistic models with and without spatial random effects to determine if the Marine National Park boundaries and available environmental covariates had an effect on snapper presence and habitat preference. Adding the spatial dependence component had little effect on the resulting model parameter estimates that emphasized positive association for particular coastal habitat types by snapper. Strong positive relationships between the presence of snapper and rock habitat, particularly rocky substrate composed of indurated freshwater sediments known as coffee rock, and kelp habitat reinforce the consideration of habitat availability in marine reserve design and the design of any associated monitoring programs.

AB An ability to reliably estimate population numbers, trends and densities of wildlife has a prominent role in conservation and management of wetlands. We use aerial surveys and simulation techniques to explore the results of past and present elephant population surveys in the Okavango Delta Panhandle, Botswana, and use these to propose a technique of simulation to improve counts in the future. Population numbers and density estimates from past survey results show large fluctuations, which are unlikely to come from reproduction. Reasons for such variations could be attributed to imprecision in survey techniques or may be because only part of the elephant range is being surveyed. Simulated surveys of hypothetical elephant populations were used to explore the effect of different survey techniques, spatial distributions of animals and spatial scale on the precision of aerial survey population estimates and trends. Our study reveals the usefulness of using simulations to test the reliability of survey data and plan more efficient surveys. We also find that while there may be some uncertainty in individual population estimates, there is more certainty in the recorded trends. These findings reinforce the need to address elephant management in the Okavango and surrounding wetland systems and call for the urgent consideration of management strategies such as fence realignments to affect the objectives of the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA) initiative, which will help relieve elephant population pressure.

AB Isolation mechanisms that prevent gene flow between populations prezygotically play important roles in achieving speciation. In flowering plants, the nighttime flowering system provides a mechanism for isolation from diurnally flowering species. Although this system has long been of interest in evolutionary biology, the evolutionary process leading to this system has yet to be elucidated because of the lack of good model species. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the differences in flowering times and the traits that attract pollinators between a pair of diurnally and nocturnally flowering species have recently been identified in a few cases. This identification enables us to build a realistic model for theoretically studying the evolution of a nocturnally flowering species. In this study, based on previous experimental data, we assumed a model in which two loci control the flowering time and one locus determines a trait that attracts pollinators. Using this model, we evaluated the possibility of the evolution of a nocturnally flowering species from a diurnally flowering ancestor through simulations. We found that a newly emerging nighttime flowering flower exhibited a sufficiently high fitness, and the evolution of a nocturnally flowering species from a diurnally flowering species could be achieved when hybrid viability was intermediate to low, even in a completely sympatric situation. Our results suggest that the difference in flowering time can act as a magic trait that induces both natural selection and assortative mating and would play an important role in speciation between diurnally and nocturnally flowering species pairs.

AB Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) is among the most aggressive freshwater invaders worldwide causing major ecological and economic damage. However, the mechanisms leading to the water-borne dispersion of the species within aquatic ecosystems, particularly lakes, is an area where research is at a relatively early stage. A numerical model has been developed to analyze and describe the dispersion that is produced by the actions of waves and currents. The model represents the basic particle processes of release (R), water-borne transport (T), and survival (S). The model has been applied to a large, deep lakeLake Tahoe. The dispersion model results reveal that (1) under episodic, extreme wind forcing, larvae are carried away from the original areas, along a discrete number of preferred pathways, (2) bays can act as retention zones, with low current velocities and recirculating eddies, and (3) the majority of the larvae released in the infested areas stay within these areas or disperse on a small spatial scale.

AB Desertification resulting from land-use affects large dryland areas around the world, accompanied by carbon loss. However it has been difficult to interpret different land-use contributions to carbon pools owing to confounding factors related to climate, topography, soil texture and other original soil properties. To avoid such confounding effects, a unique systematic and extensive repeated design of paired sampling plots of different land-use types was adopted on Ordos Plateau, N China. The sampling enabled to quantify the effects of the predominant land-use types on carbon storage as dependent on soil texture, and to define the most promising land-use choices for carbon storage, both in grassland on sandy soil and in desert grassland on brown calcareous soil. The results showed that (1) desertification control should be an effective measure to improve the carbon sequestration in sandy grassland, and shrub planting should be better than grass planting; (2) development of man-made grassland should be a good choice to solve the contradictions of ecology and economy in desert grassland; (3) grassland on sandy soil is more vulnerable to soil degradation than desert grassland on brown calcareous soil. The results may be useful for the selection of land-use types, aiming at desertification prevention in drylands. Follow-up studies should directly investigate the role of soil texture on the carbon storage dynamic caused by land-use change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The structure and composition of woody and grassy vegetation in savannas is strongly influenced by herbivores. In recent decades, the proportion of browsers has declined across African savannas in favour of more grazers, triggered by large-scale human-induced cattle grazing. This has led to overgrazing and an imbalance of woody and grassy vegetation. Our study investigated mono-specific and multi-species herbivore assemblages of varying density and assessed similarities in vegetation patterns under wildlife and livestock herbivory in and around Kruger National Park, South Africa. Under mono-specific herbivory, overall tree cover was more than twice as high compared to multi-species herbivory while the branch. ing height of small and tall trees was lowest. Small tree and bush densities were strongly elevated at mono-specific compared to multi-species herbivore sites. Tall trees were dominated by Acacia nigrescens under multi-species herbivory at low wildlife density but not at high density sites. Grass leaf nitrogen contents were almost twice as high at multi compared to mono herbivory sites, particularly beneath tree canopies. Livestock and wildlife herbivore sites showed similar patterns in their woody plant structure and grass nutrients. We conclude that a characteristic herbaceous and woody vegetation structure as well as species composition can be matched with mammalian herbivore communities, which has implications for landscape heterogeneity and grazing management in savanna systems.

AB An important component of species diversity which has recently received significant attention is the change in species composition across space, or beta diversity. Temporal turnover of species is an equally important component of species diversity, which can by itself account for diversity patterns, but has received much less attention, especially in marine communities. Indeed, patterns of diversity of marine epifaunal assemblages may be better understood through the study of variability in richness and composition of recruits that colonize and survive long enough to start a population, but before species interactions mask the diversity initially settled. Here we document temporal patterns in richness and composition of recruits of a speciose benthic cnidarian assemblage, contrasting a tropical and a subtropical site to evaluate simple predictions about latitudinal diversity and richness stability. Recruitment variation was quantified during five three-month periods at two harbour areas (Pecem at 3 degrees 32S and Ilhabela at 23 degrees 46S) in Brazil separated by 20 degrees latitude. Results show that: (1) species richness of benthic cnidarian assemblages was higher at the more tropical location, as expected from general patterns in marine species global distribution; (2) contrary to the expectation of a negative association between richness and species turnover, temporal turnover of species was similar at both sites, although more seasonal at the higher latitude site; and (3) species temporal persistence was greater at the subtropical site. Results are discussed in the context of how different environments and different regional richness may influence temporal patterns in species turnover and local richness, and how this may vary across latitudes.

AB Vegetation assessments are critical in the status and success of reintroduction programs and are an important aspect in ecological restoration. Vegetation structure and composition influences the suitability and availability of unique habitats for different wildlife species. The objectives of this study were to (1) establish the vegetation structure and composition, and (2) determine the soil-vegetation associations in southern Umfurudzi Park, Zimbabwe, prior to the reintroduction of wildlife species. Using a stratified random design, 15 rectangular plots from three strata were assessed in April and May 2012. A total of 23 woody plants from 58 tree and 68 shrub families as well as 30 grass species were recorded. Tree basal area, canopy cover, tree density, tree and grass species diversity, and tree height for the riverine strata were significantly different from the miombo and vlei strata. The influence of soil properties on the occurrence and diversity of woody and grass species was evident across the three strata. Long-term changes in the vegetation dynamics and primary productivity in southern Umfurudzi Park due to the reintroduced mega-herbivores is recommended for the success of the restoration program.

AB Applying the threshold concept to rangeland management is an important challenge in semi-arid and arid regions. Threshold recognition and prediction is necessary to enable local pastoralists to prevent the occurrence of an undesirable state that would result from unsustainable grazing pressure, but this requires a better understanding of the pastoralists' perception of vegetation threshold changes. We estimated plant species cover in survey plots along grazing gradients in steppe and desert-steppe areas of Mongolia. We also conducted interviews with local pastoralists and asked them to evaluate whether the plots were suitable for grazing. Floristic composition changed nonlinearly along the grazing gradient in both the desert-steppe and steppe areas. Pastoralists observed the floristic composition changes along the grazing gradients, but their evaluations of grazing suitability did not always decrease along the grazing gradients, both of which included areas in a post-threshold state. These results indicated that local pastoralists and scientists may have different perceptions of vegetation states, even though both of groups used plant species and coverage as indicators in their evaluations. Therefore, in future studies of rangeland management, researchers and pastoralists should exchange their knowledge and perceptions to successfully apply the threshold concept to rangeland management.

AB Predators use a variety of strategies for capturing prey. Trap-building predators can save on searching and encountering costs by investing in the construction and maintenance of traps such as webs and pits. However, what to do with partially consumed prey poses a potential problem. Antlion larvae (Myrmeleon acer) catch ants in conical pits, and dispose of partially consumed carcasses by flicking them a short distance away. We tested whether this prey-disposal behaviour affects the effectiveness of antlion pits. We observed ant behaviour around artificially constructed pits and compared falls into pits with clean margins to those with conspecific ant carcasses or control objects around the pit edge. The presence of objects near pits affected the behaviour of live ants, and reduced the effectiveness of pits. Live ants spent the most time examining fresh ant carcasses, but the presence of any object near pits deterred pitfalls. Ants fell into pits significantly more often when pit edges were clean, suggesting that antlions could incur a prey capture cost from flicking carcasses from pits as well as from the accumulation of other debris around pit margins.

AB The Proteaceae are renowned for their floral diversity but surprisingly the role of pollinators in driving evolutionary divergence in this family has been underexplored. Here we focus on recently diverged taxa to gain insight into the processes that generate diversity by testing whether two varieties of Leucospermum tottum might have originated by pollinator mediated adaptive divergence. L. tottum var. tottum has pale salmon-coloured horizontally-oriented flowers, long nectar tubes, and small volumes of concentrated nectar. L. tottum var. glabrum has red and yellow vertically oriented flowers, short nectar tubes, and large volumes of dilute nectar. Despite the morphological divergence, the varieties are indistinguishable using eight molecular markers, indicating a very early stage of differentiation. Consistent with their morphologies, L. tottum var. tottum is pollinated by long-proboscid flies (Philoliche rostrata and Philoliche gulosa), Cape sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), and, to a lesser extent, by Orange-breasted sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea), whereas, L. tottum var. glabrum is pollinated only by Orange-breasted sunbirds. A. violacea visits both varieties, but makes more frequent contact with pollen presenters when foraging on L. tottum var. glabrum. The exclusion of birds caused a steeper reduction in seed production in L. tottum var. glabrum than in L. tottum var. tottum, consistent with specialization for bird-pollination in this variety. Additionally, L. tottum var. glabrum exhibits autogamy, whereas L. tottum var. tottum does not. Floral divergence between the two L. tottum varieties corresponds with divergence in pollinator use.

AB Defoliation by herbivores can reduce carbon assimilation, change plant water relations, and even shift the biotic structure of plant communities. In this study, we took advantage of a long-term deer exclosure experiment to examine the consequences of persistent deer herbivory on plant water relations and the xylem structure-function relationships in Ceanothus rigidus, a maritime chaparral shrub in coastal California. Browsed plants had thicker stems with many intertwined short distal twigs, and significantly higher sapwood-to-leaf area ratios than their non-browsed counterparts. Leaf area-specific hydraulic conductivity was similar in both browsed and non-browsed plants, but xylem area-specific conductivity was significantly lower in the browsed plants. Vessel diameters were equivalent in both plant groups, but the number of vessels on a transverse area basis was nearly 40 % lower in the browsed plants, accounting for their lower transport efficiency. Mid-day in situ water potentials and losses of hydraulic conductivity due to embolism were similar in both groups of plants but stomatal conductance was higher in the browsed shrubs in the early part of the growing season. We discuss our findings in the context of whole-plant ecophysiology, and explore the consequences of herbivory on hormonal signals, wood anatomy, and xylem function.

AB To investigate dietary differences in two coexisting competing predators, we determined prey consumed by bobcats (Lynx rufus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) from scats in the Izta-Popo National Park, central Mexico. Use of prey by bobcats and coyotes showed a Pianka's index of overlap of 0.94, much higher than in other studies of the diet of these two species. Diets of bobcats were comprised primarily of eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus, 33.7%), rodents (22.7%), Mexican cottontail (S. cunicularius, 13.1%), the endemic and endangered volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi, 12.5%), Merriam's pocket gopher (Pappogeomys merriani, 9.3%), and long-tailed partridge (Dendrortyx macroura, 1.4%). Prey used by coyotes included primarily eastern cottontail (43.8%), rodents (15.7%), Mexican cottontail (12.0%), Merriam's pocket gopher (6.4%), and volcano rabbit (5.5%).

ID ATMOSPHERIC AMMONIA; DISPERSION; IMPACT; SCALE
AB The excreta (guano) of seabirds at their breeding colonies represents a notable source of ammonia (NH3) emission to the atmosphere, with effects on surrounding ecosystems through nitrogen compounds being thereby transported from sea to land. Previous measurements in temperate UK conditions quantified emission hotspots and allowed preliminary global upscaling. However, thermodynamic processes and water availability limit NH3 formation from guano, which suggests that the proportion of excreted nitrogen that volatilizes as NH3 may potentially be higher at tropical seabird colonies than similar colonies in temperate or sub-polar regions. To investigate such differences, we measured NH3 concentrations and environmental conditions at two tropical seabird colonies during the breeding season: a colony of 20,000 tern spp. and noddies on Michaelmas Cay, Great Barrier Reef, and a colony of 200,000 Sooty terns on Ascension Island, Atlantic Ocean. At both sites time-integrated NH3 concentrations and meteorological parameters were measured. In addition, at Ascension Island, semi-continuous hourly NH3 concentrations and micrometeorological parameters were measured throughout the campaign. Ammonia emissions, quantified using a backwards Lagrangian atmospheric dispersion model, were estimated at 21.8 mu g m(-2) s(-1) and 18.9 mu g m(-2) s(-1) from Michaelmas Cay and Ascension Island, respectively. High temporal resolution NH3 data at Ascension Island estimated peak hourly emissions up to 377 mu g NH3 m(2) s(-1). The estimated percentage fraction of total guano nitrogen volatilized was 67% at Michaelmas Cay and 32% at Ascension Island, with the larger value at the former site attributed to higher water availability. These values are much larger than published data for sub-polar locations, pointing to a substantial climatic dependence on emission of atmospheric NH3 from seabird colonies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The northern range limit of the intertidal limpet Lottia scabra is Cape Arago, Oregon (43A degrees N), where adult survival is excellent, the population is small (< 300), and recruitment is low; the range limit may be set by limited recruitment. Between June 2012 and March 2013, 25 sites from the middle of the species range (33A degrees N) to Cape Arago were sampled and population size frequency distributions, densities, and nearest neighbor distances were compared to the amount of rocky and sandy shore and kelp bed size. North and south of 37A degrees N, the densities of new recruits averaged 22 and 86 m(-2), respectively. This shift was associated with the range limit of Macrocystis pyrifera kelp beds; we hypothesize that slower currents in M. pyrifera beds may limit larval dispersal leading to higher recruitment. North and south of 40A degrees N, adult density averaged < 1 and 458 m(-2), respectively, with the species absent from many sites to the north. This shift was associated with a sharp drop in the amount of rocky shoreline and an increase in uninhabitable sandy shore. Near the northern range limit, > 80 % of the individuals were solitary and may be unable to spawn successfully. Recruitment at Cape Arago was infrequent and likely due to self-recruitment. This study suggests that the range limit was set by the absence of M. pyrifera and too little rocky shore leading to high larval wastage, low settlement, low population densities, and, due to an Allee effect, very small effective population sizes.

AB Our research presents a proof-of-concept that explores a new and innovative method to identify large animals in aerial imagery with single day image differencing. We acquired two aerial images of eight fenced pastures and conducted a principal component analysis of each image. We then subtracted the first principal component of the two pasture images followed by heuristic thresholding to generate polygons. The number of polygons represented the number of potential cattle (Bos taurus) and horses (Equus caballus) in the pasture. The process was considered semi-automated because we were not able to automate the identification of spatial or spectral thresholding values. Imagery was acquired concurrently with ground counts of animal numbers. Across the eight pastures, 82% of the animals were correctly identified, mean percent commission was 53%, and mean percent omission was 18%. The high commission error was due to small mis-alignments generated from image-to-image registration, misidentified shadows, and grouping behavior of animals. The high probability of correctly identifying animals suggests short time interval image differencing could provide a new technique to enumerate wild ungulates occupying grassland ecosystems, especially in isolated or difficult to access areas. To our knowledge, this was the first attempt to use standard change detection techniques to identify and enumerate large ungulates.

AB Connectivity in benthic marine animals with complex life cycles occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage and depends deterministically on oceanographic dynamics. The scale of such larval dispersal is highly uncertain due the difficulty of direct measurement and poor knowledge of larval dynamics and ocean flow variability. This study characterizes the pattern of genetic connectivity in the ecosystem engineer Perumytilus purpuratus between latitudes 23A degrees S and 33A degrees S, which includes the ecological discontinuity reported for many taxa north to 32A degrees S at the southeast Pacific. The genetic discontinuity observed in P. purpuratus around 26A degrees S is described herein while that detected at 28A degrees S is in line with the ecological discontinuity (in coverage, recruitment and density) previously reported for this mussel between 28A degrees S and 32A degrees S. Both discontinuities delimitate two major gene pools upon Bayesian inferences on geographical variation of five microsatellite loci. Interestingly, marker Pepu1 was responsible for most variation between pools and was potentially under selection. In fact, inferences excluding Pepu1 produced a single gene pool (k = 1) in central-northern Chile. The IBD connectivity pattern observed among P. purpuratus beds distributed in the interval 23A degrees S-33A degrees S is congruent with processes driven by larval dynamics, and the dominant equatorward Humboldt Current along a coast largely unaffected by ice during the last Pleistocene glaciation. However, the selective scenario unveiled by microsatellite Pepu1 inside the 25A degrees S-28A degrees S ecological discontinuity is consistent with selective processes associated with specific mesoscale properties operating in this area. This study highlights the usefulness of integrating different oceanographic scales, ecological data and population genetics to better understand connectivity of benthic marine species.

AB Acacia drepanolobium is an obligate ant-plant that bears dehiscent pods exploited by predispersal seed-predators and parasitoids. Fruit set and seed germination in relation to ant-association, bruchid and parasitoid infestation were investigated in a large-scale multi-year study in Kenya. Ant-association had a significant impact on the overall numbers of fruiting trees. 94.8% of Crematogaster mimosae-occupied trees, 25.6% of C.nigriceps-occupied trees, and 82.2% of Tetraponera penzigi-occupied trees set fruit. Within each tree, ant-association had no significant impact on the amount of seed produced: C.mimosae-occupied trees produced 47.5 seeds per branch, C.nigriceps-occupied trees 44.9 seeds per branch and T.penzigi-occupied trees 38.3 seeds per branch. Ant-association did not limit seed-predators or vary significantly by ant. Seeds infested by bruchids germinated in significantly lower proportions (6.2%) compared to uninfested seed (78.6%). Bruchid-infested seed is also exploited by parasitoid wasps. Parasitoids appear to have a moderate but significant rescue' effect on bruchid-infested seed with 18.4% of parasitoid-infested seed germinating. Stable isotopes (15N) revealed the trophic structure of the seed-associated insects, showing clearly that bruchids are seed predators and the parasitoid wasp Dinarmus magnus exploits the dominant Bruchidius sp.
   ResumeAcacia drepanolobium est une plante a fourmis indispensable qui porte des gousses dehiscentes exploitees par des predateurs et des parasitoides avant leur dispersion. La nouaison et la germination des graines en relation avec l'association avec les fourmis, et l'infestation de bruches et de parasites ont ete etudiees au cours d'une etude a grande echelle de plusieurs annees, au Kenya. L'association avec les fourmis a un impact significatif sur le nombre total d'arbres qui fructifient. 94.8% des Crematogaster mimosae occupes, 25.6% des C.nigriceps occupes et 82.2% des Tetraponera penzigi occupes produisent des fruits. Pour chaque arbre, l'association avec les fourmis n'a pas d'impact significatif sur la quantite de graines produites : les C.mimosae occupes produisaient 47.5 graines par branche, les C.nigriceps occupes 44.9 graines par branche et les T.penzigi 38.3 graines par branche. L'association avec les fourmis ne limitait pas les predateurs des graines ou variait significativement selon les fourmis. Les graines infestees par les bruches germaient en proportions nettement moindres (6.2%) que les graines non infestees (78.6%). Les graines infestees de bruches sont aussi exploitees par des guepes parasitoides. Ces dernieres semblent avoir un effet << salvateur >> modere mais significatif sur les graines infestees par des bruches car ces graines germent a 18.4%. Des isotopes stables (15N) revelent la structure trophique des insectes associes aux graines et montrent clairement que les bruches sont des predateurs des graines et que la guepe parasitoide Dinamus magnus exploite le dominant Bruchidius sp.

AB Perennial C-4 grasses, especially Miscanthus sinensis, are widely distributed in the degraded lands in South China. We transplanted native and exotic tree seedlings under the canopy of M. sinensis to assess the interaction (competition or facilitation) between dominant grass M. sinensis and tree seedlings. The results of growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, and ultrastructure showed that negative effects may be stronger in perennial dominant grass M. sinensis. Although M. sinensis buffered the air temperature, improved soil structure, and increased soil phosphorus content, these beneficial effects were outweighed by the detrimental effect, especially overshading. To ensure the establishment of target native species in M. sinensis communities in degraded lands of South China, restoration strategies should include removing aboveground vegetation, planting target species seedlings in openings to reduce the effects of canopy shading, and/or selecting competition-tolerant target species. Also, seedlings of exotic species used in restoration engineering cannot be directly planted under the canopy of M. sinensis.

AB The Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania is believed to contain Africa's largest population of lions (Panthera leo), making it a popular destination for trophy hunters and photographic tourists. However, a lack of recent data has raised concerns about the conservation status of this iconic population, so we collected two types of population data between 2006 and 2009. First, we identified 112 individual animals in an 800km2 study area in the photographic tourism part of Selous, giving a density of 0.14 individuals km2. This density estimate was similar to results using the same method from 1997 to 1999, but the adult sex ratio has decreased from 1 male:1.3 female in 1997 to 1 male:3 females in 2009. Second, using buffalo calf distress calls, we conducted call-up surveys to census lions in three hunting sectors in the west, east and south of Selous and in the northern photographic area. Estimated adult lion densities varied from 0.02 to 0.10km2, allowing an overall population estimate of 4,300 (range: 1,7006,900). Our results highlight the value of call-ups in surveying cryptic hunted carnivores but stress the importance of long-term projects for calibrating the responses to call-ups and for measuring trends in demography and population size.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems near breeding/roosting colonies of piscivorous seabirds can receive a large amount of marine-derived N in the form of bird feces. It has been well demonstrated that N input from seabirds strongly affects plant communities in forests or coastal grasslands. The effects of nutrient input on plant communities in agricultural ecosystems near seabird colonies, however, have rarely been evaluated. This relationship was examined in rice-paddy fields irrigated by a pond system located near a colony of the Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo in Aichi, central Japan. In the present study, spatial variations in N content (N %) and N stable isotope composition (delta N-15) of soils and wild grass species together with the growth height of plants in paddy fields in early spring (fallow period) were examined. Soils had a higher N % and delta N-15 values in fields associated with an irrigation pond that had N input from cormorants. The delta N-15 values tended to be higher around the inlet of irrigation waters, relative to the outlet. These results indicate that cormorant-derived N was input into the paddy fields via the irrigation systems. Plants growing in soil with higher delta N-15 had higher delta N-15 in the above-ground part of the plants and had luxurious growth. A positive correlation in plant height and delta N-15 of NO3-N was observed in soil plough horizons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Larval transport in the ocean can be affected by their vertical position in the water column. In biophysical models that are often used to predict larval horizontal dispersal, generally larval vertical positions are either ignored or incorporated as static parameters. Here, we evaluate the ability of one dimensional random walk based model to predict larval vertical distribution of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis in response to thermal stratification. Vertical swimming velocities were recorded at various temperatures and used to parameterize the model. Data from a previous laboratory study on the effects of thermal stratification on larval vertical distribution of S. droebachiensis were compared to the model results to evaluate the predictive ability of the model. The model predicts general trends in vertical distribution fairly well, but has a systematic bias which can be explained by un-quantified larval behaviors at the boundaries of the experimental water column. Overall, our behavioral model successfully reproduces the mechanism which regulates larval vertical distribution in response to thermal structure. Collectively, the findings suggest that simple behavioral models parameterized using simple lab experiments can prove useful in estimating the vertical distributions of invertebrate larvae in the laboratory and likely in the ocean. Such models can then be linked to bio-physical models to more accurately predict larval dispersal. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Population viability and productivity of grasses in southern African savannas are dependent upon both successful seed production and tiller recruitment from the belowground bud bank. Relative recruitment rates from buds versus seeds influence population dynamics, genetic diversity, and patterns of vegetation productivity. We assessed patterns in bud bank size and flowering effort in fourteen semi-arid savanna grass species in the Kalahari region of Botswana. There was high inter-specific variability and between-year variability in flowering effort (percentage of tillers flowering). Bud production (number of buds per tiller) exhibited high inter-specific variability, but was more consistent between-years than flowering effort. Relative allocation to flowering versus bud production varied with life history, with longer-lived perennial grasses showing higher bud production and lower flowering effort relative to shorter-lived grasses. Several species showed higher bud production and lower flowering effort in a wet year compared to a dry year, and grass species that are regularly grazed maintained significantly larger bud banks than non-grazed species. These differential demographic responses among co-occurring species suggest that environmental change in semi-arid savannas may alter the composition, relative abundances and diversity of grasses, and that the maintenance of a belowground bud bank is an important factor influencing their resiliency, their capacity to recover from grazing and/or drought, and their persistence and sustainability under changing environmental conditions. Meristem-limitation in species that maintain few viable buds may constrain their population viability under changing conditions in semi-arid savannas. (C) 2012 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Continuous leaf phenology, with sequential production of metamers, is usually found in pioneer species, but is rare in shade-tolerant species. Because of the nature of continuous growth, continuous phenology has seldom been related to meteorological factors. We studied the leaf demography of seedlings and tall trees of a shade-tolerant emergent species, Dipterocarpus sublamellatus (Dipterocarpaceae), in Malaysia. Although leaf phenology of D. sublamellatus was classified as continuous, the rates of leaf production and leaf fall were not constant and greatly fluctuated during the census period. Seasonal patterns of leaf production and fall were not synchronized across tall trees in most combinations or between seedlings and tall trees. Mean number of leaves produced per month and its seasonal fluctuation were greater in tall trees than in seedlings. Moreover, relationships between leaf phenology and meteorological factors (monthly rainfall, net radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, and minimum relative humidity) differed among trees. This suggests that endogenous rhythms, i.e., differences in allocation of resources to growth and storage among trees, are important to fluctuations in leaf phenology. These patterns are in contrast to patterns found in various pioneer species with continuous phenology, in which rates of leaf production and fall are generally constant. Different patterns might be caused by differences in allocation to growth and storage between pioneer and shade-tolerant species, and might be related to their regeneration strategies.

AB Ecological coherence is a multifaceted conservation objective that includes some potentially conflicting concepts. These concepts include the extent to which the network maximises diversity (including genetic diversity) and the extent to which protected areas interact with non-reserve locations. To examine the consequences of different selection criteria, the preffered location to complement protected sites was examined using samples taken from four locations around each of two marine protected areas: Strangford Lough and Lough Hyne, Ireland. Three different measures of genetic distance were used: F-ST,F- D-est and a measure of allelic dissimilarity, along with a direct assessment of the total number of alleles in different candidate networks. Standardized site scores were used for comparisons across methods and selection criteria. The average score for Castlehaven, a site relatively close to Lough Hyne, was highest, implying that this site would capture the most genetic diversity while ensuring highest degree of interaction between protected and unprotected sites. Patterns around Strangford Lough were more ambiguous, potentially reflecting the weaker genetic structure around this protected area in comparison to Lough Hyne. Similar patterns were found across species with different dispersal capacities, indicating that methods based on genetic distance could be used to help maximise ecological coherence in reserve networks.

The first two cases of naturalization of Acacia cyclops are reported for Italy. Young trees were observed growing in the wild some 15 years ago on Linosa (Pelagie Islands, Strait of Sicily). A decade later, this alien plant should no longer be considered as a casual, since a very intensive process of self-sown regeneration has been observed in some plantations on Lampedusa, the major island of the same Archipelago. The available literature suggests the need for careful monitoring of the ongoing invasion process, as A. cyclops has already shown a very invasive behaviour elsewhere within Mediterranean-type biomes due to its ability to withstand high environmental stresses. As migrating birds are suspected to have played an important role in facilitating the arrival of A. cyclops, further propagules are likely to reach the islands in the future. We recommend that new plantations of A. cyclops should be forbidden, but that extant naturalized populations should be managed instead of eradicating them. In fact, the effect of Acacia plantations warrants investigation at different scales in order to assess their impact on local plant-diversity and ecological succession processes.

AB Soil seed banks play an important role in the distribution and composition of plant communities in semiarid grassland ecosystems. However, information on how spatial scale influences the spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks in a grassland under grazing disturbance is still lacking. Based on field sampling and greenhouse germination, we measured the species composition and seed density of soil seed banks at different spatial scales (30 mx30 m, 30 mx60 m and 30 mx90 m) along a topographical gradient in a sandy grassland in Horqin Sand Land, Northern China. By applying geostatistical methods, we examined how spatial scale and topography affected the spatial distribution of soil seed banks in the study area. Our results showed that the total number of species in soil seed banks, as well as the number of dominant annuals, increased with the increase of spatial scales. Seed density in soil seed banks decreased with the increase of spatial scales due to an increase in the slopes and relative heights of the sampling points. Geostatistical analysis showed that the relative structural variance (C/(C-o+C)) of seed density and species richness were over 65% for all spatial scales, indicating that these variables had an obvious spatial autocorrelation and the spatial structured variance accounted for the largest proportion of the total sample variance. Spatial autocorrelation of seed density in soil seed banks increased with the increase of measured scales, while that of species richness showed a reverse trend. These results suggest that the total number of species in soil seed banks is spatial scale dependent and lower topography may accommodate more seeds. Spatial distribution of seed density in soil seed banks is also scale dependent due to topographic variation. Grassland management, therefore, needs to consider local grazing disturbance regime, spatial scale and topography.

ID DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENY
AB Garcinia has some 260 species and is often regarded as a genus with a difficult taxonomy. No recent treatment is available for the botanically rich Lower Guinea phytogeographical region. This study aims at partly filling this gap. First, several taxonomic problems are solved. G. chromocarpa is reduced to a variety of G. quadrifaria. G. gnetoides and G. granulata are both synonyms of G. quadrifaria. G. zenkeri is a synonym of G. densivenia and lectotypes are being designated for both names. G. brevipedicellata is a synonym of G. afzelii, as is G. antidysenterica for which a lectotype is designated. Second, two new species endemic to Gabon are described: Garcinia gabonensis Sosef & Dauby and Garcinia obliqua Sosef & Dauby. Finally, an identification key to all species present in the Lower Guinea region is provided. A few remaining West African species names could not be placed with certainty, because the type material was lost or not traced yet. One is a Rutaceae while the remaining three are provisionally to be regarded as synonyms of G. smeathmannii.

AB Approaches to community-based natural resource management tend to vary among programmes based on the needs and characteristics of the communities in which the programmes operate. Variation also exists within individual programmes, creating the potential for conflict if management does not recognize that these differences can indicate competing interests and needs. In this study we examine livelihood activities at the household level in a wildlife conservancy along the Kwando River in the Caprivi region of Namibia. We ask how people in the conservancy make their livelihoods and what differences exist between the conservancy's riverside and inland populations. The study finds that the inland population, c. 20 km from the river on slightly heavier soils, engages in fewer livelihood activities and has greater food security than does the riverside population. We further establish that differences between the two populations are significant enough to indicate two distinct combinations of livelihood activities with different environmental interactions. These findings suggest that any management action taken by the conservancy will affect household livelihoods differently based on location and that these differences must be considered if the conservancy is to make a successful transition from a subsistence-based agricultural system to a wildlife-based economy.

AB Whether a novel trait of an invader directly contributes to increased establishment of that invader is a relatively unstudied question in plant ecology. Nitrogen (N)-fixing shrubs comprise a significant subset of grassland invaders worldwide, which suggests the potential importance of the novel trait of N-fixation in the invasion process. We indirectly tested the importance of N-fixation in the invasion of Genista monspessulana (French broom) in a California grassland by alleviating N and phosphorus (P) limitation to the grassland matrix. Grassland productivity was co-limited by N and P; N alone did not release the resident vegetation, and did not affect Genista performance. Genista was strongly limited by P: seedlings had more nodules, greater leaf N concentration, and higher growth and survival with P additions. When N was added with P, however, growth of the resident vegetation was 50-70% greater than with N or P alone, accompanied by decreases in Genista performance. This suggests that the advantage conferred to Genista by N-fixation was dampened when the resident vegetation was released from nutrient limitation.

AB Fallen timber is widely considered to be a key element of ecosystem structure and function that is critical to maintenance of biodiversity. This concept is closely linked to ideas of wilderness and old growth. 'Conventional wisdom' is that fallen timber has been drastically depleted from natural levels by human activity. However natural conditions reflect interactions of Aborigines with their environment, and fallen timber as well as broadcast fire was critically important to Aboriginal economies in the New World and Australia. Quantitative historical data are not available, so it is necessary to use qualitative historical information to describe natural loads and dynamics of fallen timber. A comparison against detailed historical descriptions of woodlands under Aboriginal management in Australia indicates that benchmarks from 'undisturbed' examples of the same types of vegetation are generally inflated. The ecological history of grassy woodlands since European settlement shows that proposed 'restoration' measures will favour common and widespread biota at the expense of rare and endangered species. No correlation of biodiversity with fallen timber has been demonstrated for grassy eucalypt ecosystems. Globally, conservation strategies that minimize human activity have generally failed because resilience of ecosystems and ancient trees has been reduced and rare species have been lost. The concept of wilderness has little application outside the unpeopled continent of Antarctica. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New Zealand is an isolated landmass which straddles two major marine biogeographic provinces, across which eleven biogeographic regions have been identified. It also supports a high biodiversity of endemic rocky intertidal species. Although the distributions of many of these species were qualitatively described several decades ago, little quantitative data on abundance, distribution and diversity has been collected across a range of spatial scales from local to biogeographical. Without such data it is difficult to assess range dynamics and connectivity of endemic and climate-sensitive species and assemblages, and thus predict responses to future impacts of climate warming, sea level rise, coastal squeeze and ocean acidification. This paper documents the geographic distributions, abundances and assemblage patterns of intertidal limpets at 63 sites around the New Zealand coast. Limpets are key functional components of most temperate ecosystems, influencing patterns of invertebrate-macroalgal dominance, carbon cycling and biodiversity. In contrast to continental-scale studies in other temperate systems, limpet assemblages were not more similar at the level of the biogeographic province, and only weak associations were found with biogeographic region. Limpet assemblages did differ between sites, but no spatial pattern was evident. Species distributions and assemblage structures did also not appear to be strongly influenced by environmental factors including temperature, coverage of key structural taxa including barnacles, mussels and macroalgae, or other potentially competing grazers. Limpet diversity was highest at some exposed locations, but there was no national trend. In general, the high variability we observed in individual species abundances at local, regional and biogeographic scales suggests that small scale, local factors rather than broad biogeographic drivers determine New Zealand rocky intertidal limpet assemblages. This creates a challenge for ecological forecasting of future responses to global environmental change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Grazing levels and rotational schemes need to be tailored to each individual farm or pasture, and more studies are needed on the resilience of rangelands and on separating the effects of grazing and climate. The direct short-term impact of three rates of stocking (4, 8 and 16 Small Stock Units-SSU/ha) was quantified in terms of composition and cover of arid Nama Karoo vegetation (subshrub/grass). Mature Merino wethers grazed in one hectare plots during May in 1995 and 1996 (the plots were not subjected to grazing at any other time). The basal cover of the Karoo bushes (shrubs) showed a decrease at the highest stocking rate only, with the species Phymaspermum parvifolium the most sensitive to intensive grazing. An increase in stocking rate caused a significant decrease in both canopy cover and canopy-spread cover. The canopy cover of palatable Karoo bushes such as Felicia muricata, Salsola calluna and Walafrida geniculata decreased most. Light stocking (4 SSU/ha) was apparently the least detrimental to the vegetation composition and cover. Regardless of stocking rate, an 11-month resting period was possibly sufficient for all the vegetation parameters concerned to be fully restored after grazing took place. The rangeland rapidly reacted to rainfall as the ephemeral cover increased temporarily. The higher the stocking rate was, the greater the increase in ephemerals occurring. The ecological sustainability of the Nama Karoo ecosystem, utilised by high stocking densities, is questioned.

AB For the first time, comatulid crinoid feeding behaviour is used to infer near-bottom current (NBC) directions on the Terre Adelie and George V shelf, East Antarctica. We analysed 47 still-image and video transects sampled during the Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census (CEAMARC) expedition in 2007-2008. We recorded the inferred current direction from 1537 comatulid observations and interpolated these data across the shelf using the Natural Neighbour Interpolation (NNI) method. Results revealed a mode current directionality at each station and a close local agreement between the observed and interpolated NBC directions. The interpolated NBC directions show a coherent counter-clockwise gyre in the deep George V Basin, with a northward and westward flow over the northern flank of the basin and eastward flow near the coast, consistent with the distribution of bottom salinity. There also appears to be a clockwise gyre on the relatively shallow Adelie Bank, with an easterly or southeasterly flow along the outer-shelf, south and southwesterly on the east Adelie Bank, and westerly along the Terre Adelie coast.

AB Atriplex vesicaria Heward ex Benth. (Chenopodiaceae) is a widespread perennial shrub in southern Australia's chenopod rangelands but is sensitive to grazing. A detailed investigation of the demography and population dynamics of A. vesicaria under sheep grazing was conducted over 6.5 years at a range of sites across a typical paddock to assess the long-term effects of grazing on the species and elucidate the mechanisms of population change under grazing. The effects of rainfall on recruitment and mortality were also examined. Six-monthly censuses of all A. vesicaria individuals were conducted in permanent grazed and ungrazed plots at sites located across an 1100-ha paddock. Grazing increased adult shrub mortality close to water and reduced recruitment over a broader area of the paddock, but seedling survival did not appear to be affected by grazing. As a result of these changes, the population declined on grazed plots up to 2200 m from water during the study, but the decline was greatest closer to water. The population was most dynamic at the sites furthest from the water point where it was unaffected by grazing because of the greater recruitment and mortality of young plants, but because these processes balanced out over time, population density was effectively unchanged by the end of the study. Although statistical models indicated that six-monthly rainfall did not explain temporal variation in recruitment or mortality, rainfall nevertheless has a central role in both processes. In particular, longer periods of favourable rainfall and drought appear to have an important influence on recruitment and mortality, respectively, with heavy grazing during a drought period increasing mortality. Occasional shortages of seed or rains occurring during the warmer months when seed germination is limited possibly explain poor recruitment at sites unaffected by grazing following good rainfall.

AB In this study, the intestinal microbiota of kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) was examined by molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA to identify the dominant intestinal bacteria and to investigate the effects of Bacillus spp. on intestinal microbial diversity. Samples of the intestines of kuruma shrimp fed normal feed and Bacillus spp. amended feed. PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses were then performed on DNA extracted directly from the guts. Population fingerprints of the predominant organisms were generated by DGGE analysis of the universal V3 16S rDNA amplicons, and distinct bands in the gels were sequenced. The results suggested that the gut of kuruma shrimp was dominated by Vibrio sp. and uncultured gamma proteobacterium. Overall, the results of this study suggest that PCR-DGGE is a possible method of studying the intestinal microbial diversity of shrimp.

AB The reproductive payoff to an individual for participating in a group will often be affected by the size of the group. Competition for resources and predation pressure are 2 primary, factors that influence sociality and group size in a variety of species. In this correlative study, I investigated how resource competition and predation influenced group size and female reproduction in the common warthog, Phacochoerus africanus. The distribution of group sizes indicated that group size depended on the age and sex of the participants. Yearlings formed larger groups than adults, whereas adult males and adult females formed similar sized groups, although males were more likely, to be solitary. The demand for preferred habitat, clan density, predation pressure, and the time of year explained significant variation in the size of adult, female groups but not in the size of adult male or yearling groups. Clan areas with more warthogs per area of preferred habitat were associated with smaller adult female groups, whereas higher densities of warthogs were associated with larger group sizes. Increasing indication of predator presence in a clan area had little influence on grouping behavior in general but resulted in larger female group sizes late in the dry season and with increased sightings of females with juveniles. The relationship between group size and predation pressure may be a consequence of group stability and higher mortality, in larger groups.

AB In shallow rocky subtidal ecosystems in the western North Atlantic, outbreaks of the nonindigenous encrusting epiphytic bryozoan Membranipora membranacea cause defoliation of laminarian algae, facilitating a phase transition from native kelp beds to meadows of invasive algae. We quantified spatial (m [depth] to km [sites]) and temporal (hourly to monthly) patterns in the abundance of larvae of M. membranacea, and a morphologically similar native species, Electra pilosa, in relation to physical structure (temperature, salinity, density) of the water column in St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 8 dates from September to November 2007. During the study period, the water column ranged from strongly stratified to well mixed, and cross-shore movements of water masses (wind-driven upwelling and downwelling) were indicated by shoaling of the isoclines. When a strong pycnocline was located between the 2 sampled depths (4 and 12 m), larvae of both species were more abundant in the shallower, warmer, fresher layer. The linear relationship between strength of stratification and the relative abundance of larvae between depths was significant over 2 temporal (hourly, weekly) and 1 spatial (km) scale examined for M. membranacea, but not for E. pilosa. Highest abundance of larvae of both species in the warm fresh surface layer suggests onshore transport during wind-driven downwelling events. Dissimilar patterns in size-frequency distributions between the indigenous and nonindigenous bryozoan larvae suggest that species-specific characteristics of larvae of M. membranacea may be a contributing factor to its success as an invader in the western North Atlantic.

AB A conservation priority in the marine environment is the establishment of ecologically coherent reserve networks. Since these networks will integrate existent reserves, an understanding of spatial genetic diversity and genetic connectivities between areas is necessary. Using Strangford Lough marine nature reserve (MNR) as a model, spatial genetic analyses were employed to evaluate the function of the lough. Samples of the marine gastropod Nucella lapillus (L.) from 7 locations in the reserve and adjacent areas were screened at 6 microsatellites. Genetic variation was temporally stable. Significant genetic structuring (F-ST = 0.133) was observed among samples. Genetic divergence and isolation by distance indicated reduced gene flow between the marine reserve and coastal samples relative to that between adjacent coastal samples. Partitioning of genetic variation between the reserve and coast was significant (AMOVA, 7.45%, p < 0.005). Samples within the reserve were not homogeneous, and genetic diversity decreased away from the mouth of the lough. Relative genetic isolation and reduced genetic diversity in the reserve may be caused by hydrographic barriers. A cline in genetic structure was observed in the Irish Sea. This is consistent with patterning of gene flow by predominant currents, habitat availability and seasonal oceanographic features. It appears that mesoscale topographic and hydrographic features drive patterns of genetic diversity, and these factors are likely to be important for understanding MNR function. For direct developers lacking a planktonic phase, such as N. lapillus, considerations of the ecological coherence of a network are likely to be highly dependent on the habitat lying outside reserves.

AB Aims
   In spite of the importance of African acacias in vegetation succession and provision of goods and services, little is known about life-history variations within and among species. Much of the work done on African acacias has focused on seed predation and germination and seedling establishment, especially of Acacia tortilis, Acacia nilotica and Acacia karroo. The primary aim of the present work is to investigate differences in the demography of Acacia polyacantha and Acacia sieberiana and the relationship between life-history characteristics and population size. A secondary objective is to assess how fire, an important ecological factor in savanna vegetation, might modify the growth and demographic dynamics of the two acacias.
   Methods
   The study was conducted at the Makeni savanna plot in central Zambia, southern Africa. Seedling emergence from both non-scarified and scarified seeds sown at different times in the wet season and the fate and growth of seedlings and saplings were monitored over a period of 4 years. Annual growth of permanently marked sample trees in annually burnt and fire-protected blocks was recorded over a 6-year period (2002-08) in order to assess inter-specific differences and how fire modifies tree growth patterns. Censuses of natural saplings and trees were conducted periodically in sample blocks to determine recruitment into these life-history stages.
   Important findings
   Seedling emergence and sapling survival rates were Much higher in A. sieberiana than in A. polyacantha. However, both seedling and sapling growth rates were higher in A. polyacantha than in A. sieberiana but tree growth rates were similar in the two species. Under fire protection tree growth was significantly influenced by tree size and year while under annual burning only tree size significantly affected tree growth.
   The dominance of A. sieberiana over A. polyacantha at the stud), site was attributed to higher seedling emergence rate, higher sapling survival rate and a large sapling bank that forms a reliable source of tree recruitment. The life-history stage characteristics of A. polyacantha suggest that this is an early successional species.

   erosion and vegetation
AB Land degradation in the agricultural domains of South Africa has attained a scale that requires scientific intervention. To devise an appropriate control measure, we investigated the contribution of vegetation condition and soil properties to observed land degradation conditions. Twenty three degraded sites were identified and classified using a land degradation index derived from six physical degradation indicators, using multidimensional analysis techniques. A veldt condition assessment was also conducted on the sites. Soil samples from the sites were analyzed for soil degradation indicators viz., particle size fractions, aggregate stability, organic C, pH, EC, total and exchangeable Na, Mg, K and Ca. The veldt condition score ranged from 26.3 - 50%, which implied that the veldt condition has diminished by up to 50 - 77% of its standard condition. Most of the degraded sites are poorly covered; the percentage basal cover ranged from 12 - 39% with average distance of 0.8 - 30.7cm between plants. The degraded lands consisted of high (69 - 100%) proportion of increaser's species which was caused by selective grazing of palatable species by wildlife herbivores. The stable soil aggregate size ranged from 0.8 - 1.4 mm across the mechanical disaggregation, fast wetting and slow wetting tests. Soils of the degraded sites (poorly, moderately and highly degraded) have low organic carbon content < 13.0 mgkg(-1). Higher quantities of Na and Ca were observed in the highly degraded sites, indicating the effects of increased solidification and calcification on the breakdown and erosion of soil aggregates. Soil erosion was the major end occurrence in land degradation episodes at Tsolwana game reserve, which was a result of the integrated effects of the vegetation and soil variables. It is recommended that land degradation control measures should be focused on the alteration of cause-variables rather than the effects variable (soil erosion).

AB Responses of a rocky intertidal community to seasonal sand-inundation were investigated on the cool-temperate west coast of South Africa by experimentally testing the hypothesis that the crustose components in certain macroalgae survive burial, enabling them to dominate the community when the shore is sand-free. Twelve 0.25x0.25 m plots served as controls in the mid-eulittoral and 12 in the upper eulittoral zone. Treatment 1 (T1) comprised a further 12 plots in each zone that were cleared of all biota (scraping, wire-brushing and burning) soon after the sand moved off in year 2. Treatment 2 (T2) comprised clearing a further 12 plots in each zone at the end of Year 2, just before sand returned, in case T1 had inadvertently removed early-settling microscopic stages. Mid-eulittoral zone controls developed similar communities each year dominated by Mazzaella capensis, Gymnogongrus complicatus, barnacles, mussels and small limpets, with smaller covers of several other macroalgae. Both treatments significantly reduced M. capensis, G. complicatus and G. glomeratus, but did not affect covers of other species. These three species persisted as crustose holdfasts, and the latter two also as crustose tetrasporophytes; the crusts probably comprise coalescent sporelings. All other species recruited annually as the sand moved off. In the upper eulittoral zone, T2 had no effect on the biota that developed, indicating that none of the species (including the dominants Porphyra capensis and Chthamalus dentatus) relied on persistent elements to survive burial. These results confirm that sand-disturbed communities comprise a mixture of opportunistic and disturbance-tolerant species, but experimentally show the importance of crustose elements for survival of these red algae.

AB A restoration study was designed to investigate lucerne control and indigenous species re-introduction on previously cultivated land at Matjiesrivier Provincial Nature Reserve, situated at the interface between the Fynbos and Succulent Karoo biomes. The objectives were to compare four lucerne control treatments, and the simultaneous effects of these treatments on the reintroduction of indigenous species by seed, in the presence or absence of brush packs, using a split-plot design. Lucerne was controlled using herbicide, ploughing or a combination of these treatments, and seed collected from target vegetation in the area was applied to half the plots, together with reed mulch. Brush packs, comprising dead shrubs, were added to half the sown and unsown plots respectively. Ploughing significantly reduced lucerne density and projected foliage cover and in combination with herbicide eliminated most lucerne plants. Establishment of indigenous species from sown seed was highest in ploughed plots and comprised both annuals and perennials. There was virtually no establishment in the presence of the alien annual Amsinckia retrorsa. Indigenous perennial plant density, cover and richness were highest throughout the study in the 'plough plus seed' treatments, with Athanasia linifolia being the dominant species. Average initial densities of 80 m(-2) decreased sharply during the first summer, and at three years averaged 5 m(-2). Indigenous canopy cover continued to increase throughout the three years in two of the experimental blocks, and attained that of the target vegetation in 'plough plus seed' treatments. Community composition approached that of the target vegetation, although graminoids were under-represented, partly as a result of intensive grazing during the third year, and large, non-Asteraceous shrubs were under-represented. In future restorations at the Fynbos-Karoo interface, it is recommended that the sowing density, particularly of unpalatable pioneer shrubs, be reduced to improve composition and to lower seed harvesting costs. Ploughing is an essential presowing treatment where alien species, especially annuals, dominate the old field. A larger number of species may be established following the creation of different microsites across the field, for example by pitting and brush-packing the surface. Nodes of larger, animal-dispersed species could be established from propagated material to facilitate colonisation of these species across large disturbed areas. It is recommended that sown areas be protected from ungulate grazing until the palatable species have reached maturity.

AB The control of invasive alien plants is one of the major tasks facing conservation managers of South African fynbos vegetation. Extensive clearance work currently is underway, but the ultimate success of these operations depends upon good indigenous vegetation recovery. Fynbos species potentially may recruit from persistent seed banks in the soil, but surface seed banks may become depleted under dense aliens and deeper seed banks may fall to germinate. In this study, the effect on fynbos recovery of disturbing the soil mechanically, to a depth of 100-150 mm, following alien clearance, was investigated. It was hypothesised that soil disturbance would promote germination from persistent, soil-stored seed banks. It was further hypothesised that soil disturbance would have a greater effect following high compared to low fire intensities. Soil disturbance had no effect on total plant recruitment. There was a significant negative relationship between fire intensity and plant density two years post-fire. Recruitment levels at the study site were low compared to those at sites invaded for two to three decades. This indicates that fynbos seed persistence may decline rapidly after four decades of burial. Soil disturbance resulted in higher indigenous species richness and projected canopy cover at the final census, two years post-fire, Changes to guild structure following soil disturbance included an increase in the cover of shrubs relative to graminoids and forbs, and small-seeded species relative to larger-seeded myrmecochorous species. Soil disturbance caused similar changes to guild structure in both high and low fire intensity plots. Soil disturbance is not recommended as a universal treatment following the clearance of dense stands of aliens. Used in conjunction with indigenous sowing, it may improve restoration at long-invaded, deep-soil sites, following fires of unnaturally high intensity. Post-fire soil disturbance should promote species richness in seedling recruits, plant growth conditions and the development of vegetation cover, while sowing would increase plant density and re-introduce guilds not present in relict soil seed banks.

AB The style enzymes and enteric bacteria of two intertidal mussels, Perna perna (L.) and Choromytilus meridionalis (Kr), were tested for activity on ten structural and storage carbohydrates. Both mussels digested the storage carboyhydrates amylose, glycogen and laminarin, and the structural carbohydrate carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). C. meridionalis broke down the digested storage carbohydrates with equal efficiency, while P. perna digested laminarin acid glycogen more efficiently than amylose. P. perna produced large volumes of enzymes with low dissociation rates, while the opposite was true for C. meridionalis. As a result, P. perna released significantly more glucose (ANOVA: P<0.05) from all substrates, even though it had significantly lower specific enzyme activities (P < 0.05). Likewise, both mussels could digest bacteria isolated from their guts, but P. perna digested more bacterial strains, more efficiently, than C. meridionalis. In contrast, C. meridionalis housed larger populations of gut bacteria which digested carbohydrates more efficiently than those from P. perna. Mixed bacterial cultures from both mussels showed consistently high activity on storage carbohydrates. Activity was consistent, but low, on two structural carbohydrates (CMC and mannan) but sporadic on the other structural compounds (carrageenin, fucoidan and xylan). Electron microscopy showed that both mussels housed two distinct populations of bacteria: resident spirochaete bacteria (presumably Cristispira spp) in the style, and a mixture of rod, coccoid and filamentous bacteria associated with the gut contents. The sporadic presence of bacteria which digest most structural carbohydrates, and their association with the gut contents, indicate that these bacteria are transient. This means that the association between the mussels and their enteric bacteria is incidental rather than obligatory. The spirochaete bacteria in the style have an obligate relationship with the mussels and may increase the amount of carbohydrases produced, but not the range of enzymes available to the host.

AB Cellana grata is a high-zoned, exposed-shore limpet with a lifespan of 3 years. Patelloida pygmaea is a low-zoned, sheltered-shore limpet with a lifespan of 1 year. C grata migrates up-shore in winter, but occurs lower on the shore in summer. This migration is synchronized with variations in algal availability high on the shore; such variations are, however, themselves related to seasonal changes in wave height. P. pygmaea is restricted to the low shore, year round. The movements upwards in winter and downwards in summer are still evident. Algal species richness increased from September to reach a peak between December and March, and to abruptly diminish between May and June. The encrusting algae Brachytrichia maculans, Hildenbrandia prototypus, Lithothamnion sp. and Ralfsia verrucosa were present year round. The timing of juvenile recruitment of C. grata and P. pygmaea was from October to July and February to October, respectively. Temperature may be important in enhancing juvenile survival by affecting the seasonal pattern of algal occurrence on the shore. Seasonal fluctuations in the rate of growth were recorded for both species with the time of fastest growth of C. grata and P. pygmaea occurring between October and March and September and February, respectively. Mortality of both species occurred mainly in summer. Summer heat, predation and intraspecific competition for food appear to be the major causes of death.

TI Competition for pollinators destabilizes plant coexistence
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID MECHANISMS; MAINTENANCE; IMPACTS
AB Mounting concern over the global decline of pollinators has fuelled calls for investigating their role in maintaining plant diversity. Theory predicts that competition for pollinators can stabilize interactions between plant species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation, while at the same time can drive competitive imbalances that favour exclusion. Here we empirically tested these contrasting effects by manipulating competition for pollinators in a way that predicts its long-term implications for plant coexistence. We subjected annual plant individuals situated across experimentally imposed gradients in neighbour density to either ambient insect pollination or a pollen supplementation treatment alleviating competition for pollinators. The vital rates of these individuals informed plant population dynamic models predicting the key theoretical metrics of species coexistence. Competition for pollinators generally destabilized the interactions between plant species, reducing the proportion of pairs expected to coexist. Interactions with pollinators also influenced the competitive imbalances between plant species, effects that are expected to strengthen with pollinator decline, potentially disrupting plant coexistence. Indeed, results from an experiment simulating pollinator decline showed that plant species experiencing greater reductions in floral visitation also suffered greater declines in population growth rate. Our results reveal that competition for pollinators may weaken plant coexistence by destabilizing interactions and contributing to competitive imbalances, information critical for interpreting the impacts of pollinator decline.

AB Biomes of the world have long been assumed to be determined by climate. Major disparities, where open low biomass systems occurred in the same climate zone as closed forests have been dismissed as products of deforestation. Many of these open ecosystems of the world, have been shown to be of ancient origins, stable alternatives to forests, and typically maintained by disturbance regimes. Open ecosystems include some of the most biodiverse regions in the world. They are often consumer-controlled by large mammal herbivores or fire. Mosaics of closed forest and open ecosystems have been interpreted as alternative stable states with each state maintained by positive feedbacks to environmental conditions that maintain that state. For example, flammable grasses maintain fires which consume woody plants, while closed forests exclude flammable grasses by shading them out. Understanding open ecosystems may therefore require some radical revision of familiar ecological concepts, starting with the hypothesis that climate largely determines world vegetation patterns. Open ecosystems function differently from forests in an earth system context affecting the hydrological cycle, rates of rock weathering, and presenting a different planetary surface to solar radiation reaching the earth's land surface. Open ecosystems require explicit attention in conservation policy and management.

AB Biodiversity, a term now widely employed in science, policy, and wider society, has a burgeoning associated literature. We synthesize aspects of this literature, focusing on several key concepts, debates, patterns, trends, and drivers. We review the history of the term and the multiple dimensions and values of biodiversity, and we explore what is known and not known about global patterns of biodiversity. We then review changes in biodiversity from early human times to the modern era, examining rates of extinction and direct drivers of biodiversity change and also highlighting some less-well-studied drivers. Finally, we turn attention to the indirect drivers of global biodiversity loss, notably humanity's increasing global consumption footprint, and explore what might be required to reverse the ongoing decline in the fabric of life on Earth.

AB In the last decades, the number of publications dedicated to the application of species distribution models (SDMs) to invasive alien plants (IAPs) has constantly increased. Although recent reviews have addressed very relevant issues in the application of SDMs, the modelling approaches (i.e., algorithms) applied to IAPs have not been systematized. Therefore, we undertook a bibliographic review of articles devoted to SDMs and IAPs, from 1996 to 2019. Our results indicate that maximum entropy, generalized linear models, boosted regression trees and random forest were the four most frequent types of modelling approaches. It was clear that there was a variety of different approaches, regarding the type of algorithm to be used. We discuss the characteristics of the most cited algorithms, providing examples of their application in SDMs dedicated to IAPs. We advocate the use of a com-bination of different algorithms, an intensive evaluation of predictors, a thorough validation process, and a critical analysis of model predictions.

AB Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are amongst the major drivers of biodiversity loss globally. Although habitat fragmentation poses additional threats to biodiversity beyond habitat loss alone, the IUCN's Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) does not provide guidance on how to assess these threats. This study develops an approach for incorporating habitat fragmentation into the RLE threat assessment and investigates additional insights such an analysis could provide beyond the analysis of distribution trends. This is achieved by quantifying RLE criteria A and B (distribution reduction, restricted distribution and decline) and comparing outcomes with indices of habitat fragmentation (core area, Largest Patch Index, Patch Cohesion Index and Aggregation Index) in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Results revealed that much of the Cape Floristic Region is severely threatened by both landscape transformation and habitat fragmentation, but that treating the habitat fragmentation indices as additional RLE criteria did not alter the ecosystem threat assessment outcomes. Whilst this suggests that the existing RLE criteria implicitly account for habitat fragmentation, the relationship between fragmentation indices and RLE criteria were weak and highly variable in some cases, indicating that the RLE criteria alone do not sufficiently account for the threat of habitat fragmentation. Supplementing the RLE with habitat fragmentation measures highlights additional, unique information on threats to ecosystems. This simple approach has the potential to assist in setting conservation priorities and management goals, particularly in fragmented ecosystems.

AB The lithology, ostracods, palynomorphs and black carbon of a sediment core from a saline wetland in the southern Tibetan highlands (29 degrees 14'33.40 '' N/87 degrees 13'09.10 '' E, 4480 m a.s.I., A.R. Xizang, China) is analyzed and climate modelling applied with respect to core questions in Quaternary research: (1) Do mesoclimatic effects of regional landscape structures like high mountains overrule the effects of global climates? (2) Did life persist during the LGM? (3) Which shifts in ecosystems can be detected? (4) Does the fire-record testify for the presence of humans and their environmental impact? (5) How old is Neolithisation in the world's largest highlands?
   The results of this integrated multi-disciplinary investigation revealed (1) the meso-climatic effect of the Himalayan arc's relief channeled westerlies with West-Himalayan forest-pollen types into the southern Tibetan highlands, with (2) higher winter-precipitation, slightly lower summer precipitation, and the persistence of life for plants, and herbivores and therefore probably hunters. (3) The most arid period occurred between 17.8 and 15 cal kyr B.P., possibly synchronous with the Heinrich 1 event. Around 14.8 cal kyr B.P. humidity increased with torrential rains of high erosive power on sparsely plant-covered slopes and lasted until 4 cal kyr B.P. (4) The continuous fire-record proved the availability of combustible matter and a constant fire source which is believed to be human-attributed. Charcoal peaks around 17, 16 and 13 cal kyr B.P. remained sporadic until 11.5 cal kyr B.P. and attained the highest values since 8.7 cal kyr B.P. Black carbon increased steadily until 11 cal kyr B.P. and sharply peaked with high fluctuations around 10 cal kyr B.P., indicating high frequency intensive fires at the beginning of the Holocene. Between 10 and 6 cal kyr B.P. fire frequency decreases, with a slight peak around 4 cal kyr B.P. (5) The dawn of pastoralism in the early Mid Holocene Climatic Optimum dated back to 8.7 cal kyr B.P. with a decline of grass-pollen and the synchronous emergence of grazing weeds, leaving a perception gap of 5000 years between the palaeo-ecological and the archaeological state of the art.

TI Trophic structure of a pond community dominated by an invasive alien

AB Invaders affect native species across multiple trophic levels, influencing the structure and stability of freshwater communities. Based on the 'trophic position hypothesis', invaders at the top of the food web are more harmful to native species via direct and indirect effects than trophically analogous native predators are.
   However, introduced and native predators can coexist, especially when non-native species have no ecological and behavioural similarities with natives, occupy an empty niche, or natives show generalist anti-predator strategies that are effective at the community level.
   At present, conservation efforts are focused on eradicating invaders; however, their removal may lead to unwanted and unexpected outcomes, especially when invaders are well established and strongly interspersed with natives. This highlights the need to consider invaders in a whole-ecosystem context and to consider the evolutionary history and behavioural ecology of natives and invaders before active management is applied.
   Here, stomach content and stable isotope analyses were combined to investigate a pond system dominated by invaders in order to understand the effects of the interactions among upper level predators and lower level members of the food web on the whole community structure.
   Both diet and isotope analyses showed that several invaders contributed to the diet of natives and invaders. A significant isotope overlap was found among upper level predators. However, stomach content analysis suggested that predators reduced the potential competition differentiating the food spectrum by including additional prey in their diet. Both native and non-native upper level predators, by preying on invaders, seem not to exert a strong suppressive effect through predation and competition on native species.
   This research confirms the importance of studying food webs to identify ecological conditions that forecast the potential for deleterious impacts before management is applied. In cases where invaders cannot be eradicated, management efforts should follow a conciliatory approach promoting the coexistence of native species with invaders.

AB The mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar) are molluscs native to the Amazonia region and their exploration and farming has increased considerably in recent years. These animals are farmed on beds built in the rivers of the Amazonia estuaries and, therefore, the composition of their microbiome should be directly influenced by environmental conditions. Our work aimed to evaluate the changes in bacterial composition of oyster's microbiota at two different seasons (rainy and dry). For this purpose, we amplified and sequenced the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. According to the rarefaction curve, the sampling effort was sufficient to describe the bacterial diversity in the samples. Alpha-diversity indexes showed that the bacterial microbiota of oysters is richer during the rainy season. This richness is possibly associated with the diversity at lower taxonomic levels, since the relative abundance of bacterial phyla in the two seasons remained relatively constant. The main phyla found include Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Similar results were found for the species Crassostrea gigas, Crassostrea sikamea, and Crassostrea corteziensis. Beta-diversity analysis showed that the bacterial composition of oyster's gut microbiota was quite different in the two seasons. Our data demonstrate the close relationship between the environment and the microbiome of these molluscs, reinforcing the need for conservation and sustainable management of estuaries in the Amazonia.

AB Invasive plants often impact soil conditions, notably through changes in soil chemistry and microbial community composition, potentially leading to altered soil functionality. We determine the impacts of invasive nitrogen-fixing Australian Acacia trees on soil chemistry and function (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling) in South Africa's Core Cape Subregion, and whether any differences in soil function are linked to differences in soil chemical properties and bacterial community composition between neighbouring acacia-invaded and uninvaded sites. We do so by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing data together with soil chemistry and soil enzyme activity profiles. Acacias significantly increased levels of soil nitrogen (NO3-, NH4+, and total N), C, and pH. Although we did not find evidence that acacias affected soil bacterial community diversity, we did find them to alter bacterial community composition. Acacias also significantly elevated microbial phosphatase activity, but not beta-glucosidase, whilst having contrasting effects on urease. Changes in soil chemical properties under acacia invasion were found to correlate with changes in enzyme activities for urease and phosphatase. Similarly, changes in soil bacterial community composition were correlated to changes in phosphatase enzymatic activity levels under acacia invasion. Whilst we found evidence for acacias altering soil function by changing soil chemical properties and bacterial community composition, these impacts appear to be specific to local site conditions.

AB Soil arthropods are important components of savannas, contributing to nutrient cycling and thus primary productivity. To investigate how fire and mammalian herbivores influence arthropod food webs, we used two long term herbivore exclosures (ca. 20 y) and burning trials (ca. 5-y return) located along rivers in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Herbivory and fire will usually have negative effects on soil arthropods although this can be variable, and dependent on multiple aspects of habitat structure and nutrient cycling. We hypothesised that in our sites, the more chronic herbivory disturbance would have stronger and more effects than fire, and that both fire and herbivory would decrease arthropod abundance, biomass and diversity via changes to habitat structure and nutrient cycling.
   We used a structural equation model to investigate these mechanisms, and to compare these drivers. This model supported our hypothesis that herbivory had more and stronger effects than fire, largely through indirect flow-on effects. We also found evidence to support a 'tolerance/avoidance' hypothesis, in that herbivory increased soil arthropod diversity by decreasing soil nutrients. Herbivores also decreased arthropod biomass and abundance in total and in all trophic groups excluding omnivores.
   Fire and herbivory are closely linked, careful consideration should be made when making decisions in the management of either. In some areas either driver may be more dominant, as was the case in our research. Further studies should incorporate a range of fire frequencies and intensities, as well as herbivore types, densities and abundances. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, we characterized the digestive gland ('gut') bacterial community (microbiome) of the Ohio pigtoe, Pleurobema cordatum (Rafinesque, 1820), using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Two populations were compared: wild P cordatum (n = 5) from the Tennessee River and P. cordatum (n = 9) relocated to artificial mesocosms and exposed to various thermal regimes for 2 weeks. We also characterized the bacterial communities from the habitat (water and sediment) of these wild and mesocosm-held populations. The gut microbiome of wild P. cordatum was dominated by members of the bacterial phylum Tenericutes (72%). By contrast, the gut microbiome of mesocosm-held P. cordatum was dominated by members of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria (64%). We found no temperature-associated difference in the gut microbiome of mesocosm-held P. cordatum. The bacterial communities of water and sediment from the Tennessee River were diverse and distinct from those of the studied mussels. By contrast, the bacterial communities of water and sediment in the mesocosms were dominated by Proteobacteria. These results suggest that when the studied mussels were moved into artificial rearing environments, their gut microbiome shifted to reflect that of their habitat (i.e. an increase in Proteobacteria). Moreover, the abundance of Tenericutes (also previously reported in other unionids) was reduced from 72% in wild mussels to 3% in mesocosm-held mussels. As a result, we think that mesocosm-held P. cordatum became dysbiotic, which could explain the observed wasting syndrome and associated trickling mortalities in captive P. cordatum.

AB Despite their diversity and the potential for specialized pollination systems, Australian Fabaceae have received little attention in pollination studies. In the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR), a recognized biodiversity hotspot, co-occurring and abundant species of Faboideae exhibit a range of floral colours and forms, suggestive of adaptation to different groups of pollinators. For four communities of Fabaceae in the SWAFR we investigated whether co-occurring species overlap in pollinator genera, whether these pollinators show differences in behaviour on the pea flower and whether variations in stamen length and nectar composition among species are associated with different pollinator types. Species of Fabaceae were visited by one to four genera of native bees, suggesting varying levels of ecological specialisation. In Fabaceae with more specialized interactions, co-occurring species showed marked differences in the bee genera attracted. Unexpectedly, some Fabaceae frequently attracted beetles, which may play an important role in their pollination. There was no evidence for an association between stamen length or nectar composition and the type of pollinator. The introduced honeybee, visited all studied species of Fabaceae, suggesting that they may act both as a pollinator and a potential competitor with native pollinators.

AB Connectivity is a fundamental ecological property affecting stability, resilience and recovery of marine populations, in particular in networks of patchy habitats as the Mesophotic Biogenic Habitats of the Northern Adriatic Sea. Specific information on the dispersal behaviour of many species living in these habitats is lacking, thus the connectivity simulations were performed over different pelagic propagules duration and different reproductive seasons of six consecutive years, covering most of the possible dispersal behaviour variability. The connectivity simulations were analysed with graph analysis methods by characterizing each connectivity graph with several structural measures and by identifying sites with greatest individual and group centrality. We tested the hypothesis that geographic proximity of sites cannot be a proxy for the connectivity and that hydrodynamic connectivity is statistically significantly related to the observed beta diversity among the studied sites. Results showed that species with different pelagic propagules duration follow greatly different dispersal dynamics, and that the network of studied outcrops is only partially connected to coastal benthic populations. Our results also made possible a critical appraisal of the current conservation strategies, evidencing gaps in the existing network of protected Mesophotic Biogenic Habitats in the Northern Adriatic Sea. We suggest possible improvements for an efficient preservation strategy of these unique biodiversity hotspots by including a fundamental ecological process, the dispersal connectivity, into the process of decision making for conservation.

AB There has been a recent demand for forecasting in ecology, particularly in the field of ecosystem management. Empirical dynamic modelling (EDM), an equation-free nonlinear forecasting method, is receiving growing attention, but it requires long time series to produce accurate predictions. Though most ecological time series are short, spatial replicates are often available. Here we explore how utilizing available spatial data can improve our ability to forecast ecological dynamics.
   There are several ways to incorporate spatial information into EDM and not all have been applied in ecology. We compare spatial EDM approaches used in ecology and physics and introduce a flexible Bayesian model that makes use of prior movement information.
   We test these methods on simulated data generated with three population dynamics models with varying levels of complexity, time series length, spatial symmetry and heterogeneity. Adding spatial data generally improves accuracy, though the best method depends on the spatial process. We applied the methods to empirical fisheries data, highlighting the complexity of real population dynamics.
   Leveraging spatial data is an effective way to overcome the problem of short ecological time series. Since the best forecasting method depends on the underlying dynamics, we suggest that users apply several in concert and that this may be useful in identifying spatial heterogeneity in dynamics.

LA English
DT Article
DE bridgehead effect; coalescing colonies; invasion framework;
   self-similarity; spread; stratified dispersal
AB Despite the enormous negative consequences of biological invasions, we have a limited understanding of how spatial demography during invasions creates population patterns observed at different spatial scales. Early stages of invasions, arrival and establishment, are considered distinct from the later stage of spread, but the processes of population growth and dispersal underlie all invasion phases. Here, we argue that the spread of invading species, to a first approximation, exhibits scale invariant spatial-dynamic patterns that transcend multiple spatial scales. Dispersal from a source population creates smaller satellite colonies, which in turn act as sources for secondary invasions; the scale invariant pattern of coalescing colonies can be seen at multiple scales. This self-similar pattern is referred to as "stratified diffusion" at landscape scales and the "bridgehead effect" at the global scale. The extent to which invasions exhibit such scale-invariant spatial dynamics may be limited by the form of the organisms' dispersal kernel and by the connectivity of the habitat. Recognition of this self-similar pattern suggests that certain concepts for understanding and managing invasions might be widely transferable across spatial scales.

AB This review and synthesis article attempts to integrate observations from forestry to contemporary development in related biological research fields to explore the issue of forest productivity enhancement and its contributions in mitigating the wood supply shortage now facing the forest sector. Compensatory growth has been clearly demonstrated in the long-term precommercial thinning and fertilization trial near the Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia, Canada. This phenomenon appears similar to many observations from other biological fields. The concept of compensatory growth can be applied to forest productivity enhancement through overcompensation, by taking advantage of theories and methods developed in other compensatory growth research. Modeling technology provides an alternative approach in elucidating the mechanisms of overcompensation, which could reveal whether the Shawnigan Lake case could be generalized to other tree species and regions. A new mitigation strategy for dealing with issues related to wood supply shortage could be formed through searching for and creating conditions promoting overcompensation. A forest growth model that is state dependent could provide a way of investigating the effect of partial harvest on forest growth trajectories and stand dynamics. Results from such a study could provide cost-effective decision support tools to practitioners.

AB Spatially overdispersed mounds of fungus-farming termites (Macrotermitinae) are hotspots of nutrient availability and primary productivity in tropical savannas, creating spatial heterogeneity in communities and ecosystem functions. These termites influence the local availability of nutrients in part by redistributing nutrients across the landscape, but the links between termite ecosystem engineering and the soil microbes that are the metabolic agents of nutrient cycling are little understood. We used DNA metabarcoding of soils fromOdontotermes montanusmounds to examine the influence of termites on soil microbial communities in a semi-arid Kenyan savanna. We found that bacterial and fungal communities were compositionally distinct in termite-mound topsoils relative to the surrounding savanna, and that bacterial communities were more diverse on mounds. The higher microbial alpha and beta diversity associated with mounds created striking spatial patterning in microbial community composition, and boosted landscape-scale microbial richness and diversity. Selected enzyme assays revealed consistent differences in potential enzymatic activity, suggesting links between termite-induced heterogeneity in microbial community composition and the spatial distribution of ecosystem functions. We conducted a large-scale field experiment in which we attempted to simulate termites' effects on microbes by fertilizing mound-sized patches; this altered both bacterial and fungal communities, but in a different way than natural mounds. Elevated levels of inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium may help to explain the distinctive fungal communities in termite-mound soils, but cannot account for the distinctive bacterial communities associated with mounds.

AB Marine soft-sediments sustain functionally important benthic assemblages that are critical for remineralization of organic matter and supply of nutrients to the water column. While these assemblages are well studied along continental margins, investigations from insular margin that surround oceanic islands are very limited. This paper examines the distribution and standing stock of macrozoobenthos at 50, 100, and 200 m depth contours surrounding the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago in the tropical Indian Ocean. The standing stock of macrozoobenthos decreased from the mesophotic reef areas (50 m depth) to the deeper strata (200 m), particularly in the case of the dominant groups, the polychaetes and crustaceans. Smaller-sized, interstitial polychaetes and crustaceans were abundant in the coarser sandy sediments at the shallower sites. The polychaetes were represented by 606 species (279 genera) in the study, of which >50% were rare species. Based on polychaete species composition, three regions were delineated in the study area - the Nicobar margin, the western margin of the Andaman (Bay of Bengal sector), and the eastern margin of the Andaman (Andaman Sea sector). The long, uninterrupted Andaman Island chain formed a geographic barrier separating the eastern and western margins, resulting in the regional distinctions in sediment nature and hydrographic characteristics, which in turn influenced species distribution. Corresponding differences were absent in the case of the Nicobar Islands, which are widely separated by transecting channels, permitting exchange of water between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Within the three regions, polychaete communities changed significantly in taxonomic and functional composition with increasing depth. The well oxygenated, coarse sandy sediments around mesophotic reefs (50 m) harbored predator-dominated assemblages. The 200 m sites, which were characterized by oxygen minimum conditions (<0.5 ml.l(-1)), particularly around the Andaman Island mass, were dominated by deposit feeders. This study provides the first comprehensive dataset on distribution and standing stock of macrozoobenthos, and community structure of polychaetes along the Andaman and Nicobar insular margin. It also revealed the highest number of polychaete species ever recorded in the northern Indian Ocean, indicating that the Andaman and Nicobar margin is a significant marine biodiversity hotspot.

AB Ants are central-place foragers: they always return to the nest, and this requires the ability to remember relationships between features of the environment, or an individual's path through the landscape. The distribution of these cognitive responsibilities within a colony depends on a species' foraging style. Solitary foraging as well as leader-scouting, which is based on information transmission about a distant targets from scouts to foragers, can be considered the most challenging tasks in the context of ants' spatial cognition. Solitary foraging is found in species of almost all subfamilies of ants, whereas leader-scouting has been discovered as yet only in theFormica rufagroup of species (red wood ants). Solitary foraging and leader-scouting ant species, although enormously different in their levels of sociality and ecological specificities, have many common traits of individual cognitive navigation, such as the primary use of visual navigation, excellent visual landmark memories, and the subordinate role of odour orientation. In leader-scouting species, spatial cognition and the ability to transfer information about a distant target dramatically differ among scouts and foragers, suggesting individual cognitive specialization. I suggest that the leader-scouting style of recruitment is closely connected with the ecological niche of a defined group of species, in particular, their searching patterns within the tree crown. There is much work to be done to understand what cognitive mechanisms underpin route planning and communication about locations in ants.

AB The influence of oceanographic fronts on the abundance and community composition of invertebrate larvae, mostly of benthic species, along nearly 2000 km of the southwestern Atlantic shelf (21-34 degrees S) was investigated. Meroplankton was sampled through vertical hauls at 89 stations, distributed along 14 cross-shelf transects, during late spring 2010 and early summer 2011. Salinity and temperature were registered with a CTD/rosette system, which provided seawater for chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations estimations. Vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a and nutrients were used as proxies of the fronts. In addition, high-resolution thermosalinograph data were used to detect surface frontal features. Meroplankton abundance peaks were found at several fronts intersected by the ship, including upwelling zones, estuarine and plume fronts, a shelf-break front, and two cyclonic eddies. Furthermore, meroplankton abundance was also relatively higher at small-scale thermal and/or saline surface fronts observed along the shelf. Such increases in meroplankton abundance are likely to be ascribed to high nutrient input and primary production. Distinct taxa of invertebrate larvae occurred at different types of fronts, besides the coastal realm, which was virtually dominated by decapod, cirripede and bivalve larvae. Small-scale shelf fronts presented high abundances of decapod and gastropod larvae, for instance, while larvae of polychaetes were the most frequent in the estuarine front of Patos Lagoon section.

AB The study of how trap design responds to biotic and abiotic conditions can help to understand the selective forces affecting the foraging of trap-building organisms. We experimentally tested whether pit design can be modified by intraspecific competition for space in larvae ofMyrmeleon crudelis, a common sit-and-wait predator that digs conical pit traps in the soil to capture walking arthropods. In a tropical forest in Costa Rica, we measured pit dimensions, larval body size, and the level of competition (i.e., density of neighboring traps) in 40 antlion larvae. These larvae were then taken to the laboratory and allowed to build new traps in individual containers. We measured within-individual changes in the size of traps in the field and in the laboratory, and related these to the level of competition experienced in the field. Larvae with relatively high levels of competition in the field showed a greater increase in the size of their pits in the laboratory. This change was independent of larval size. Larvae with none or few neighbors in the field showed little change in their pit sizes, whereas those with higher competition levels increased their diameter and depth up to 1,400% and 1,000%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that, at least in high-density aggregations, pit design is restricted by competition in addition to the constraints imposed by body size. This work suggests that biotic interactions can play a role in the design of extended phenotypes in sit-and-wait predators that live in dense aggregations.

AB Our review of the CITES trade database confirmed that the ball python is the most exported species by Togo; with 1,657,814 live individuals - comprising 60% of all live reptiles - reported by importing countries since 1978 (almost 55,000 annually since 1992). In total, 99% of the ball pythons legally exported from Togo under CITES were intended for commercial use, presumably as exotic pets. Since the turn of the century, wild-sourced snakes exported from Togo have been largely replaced with ranched snakes, to the extent that in the last 10 years 95% of these live exports were recorded using CITES source code "R" with the majority destined for the USA. We found discrepancies in the CITES trade database that suggest ball python exports were consistently underestimated by Togo and that both ranched and wild-sourced ball python annual quotas have been exceeded on multiple occasions including as recently as 2017. Furthermore, our field visits to seven of these "python farms" revealed that they are also involved in the commercial trade in at least 46 other reptile species, including eight that are already involved in formal CITES trade reviews due to concerns regarding their sustainability and legality. Ranching operations in West Africa were once thought to provide a degree of protection for the ball python; however, in light of recent research, there is growing concern that ranching may not confer any significant net conservation benefits. Further scrutiny and research are required to ensure the long-term survival of wild ball python and other reptile species populations in Togo.

AB During the evolution of aquatic animals, co-evolution between host and microbes has been overlooked. Previous studies have shown that microbes were present in the fertilized egg of fish, but compared with fish, little in-formation is available for crustaceans. High-throughput Illumina Miseq DNA sequencing of the V3-V4 domain of the 16S rRNA gene was used to assess the microbial community composition during different stages of em-bryonic development in Macrobrachium rosenbergii : fertilized egg stage (OM1), cleavage stage (OM2), blastula stage (OM3), gastrula stage (OM4), egg nauplius stage (OM5), egg metanauplius stage (OM6), protozoea stage (OM7) and zoea stage (OM8). Water samples (WMZ) were also assessed. The results showed that Proteobacteria (82.92%), Bacteroidetes (9.27%), and Actinobacteria (4.49%) were the predominant phylum in the M. rosenbergii embryo. At the genus level, the microbial composition was constantly changing during embryonic development. We concluded that OM3 and OM4 might be the critical stage for transformation of the microbial composition in the M. rosenbergii embryo. The main factor responsible for microbial colonization in the embryo was primarily selective pressure exerted by the shrimp, while the microbial community in the water environment had a lower impact. This study describes bacterial communities in different stages of embryonic development in M. ro-senbergii , and the effects of the surrounding environment on microbial colonization. These findings provide valuable information for further studies examining the formation of early intestinal flora in crustaceans.

AB Shrub-dominated ecosystems support biodiversity and play an important storage role in the global carbon cycle. However, it is challenging to characterize biophysical properties of low-stature vegetation like shrubs from conventional ground-based or remotely sensed data. We used spectral and structural variables derived from high-resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery to estimate the aboveground biomass of shrubs in theBetulaandSalixgenera in a montane meadow in Banff National Park, Canada using an area-based approach. In single-variable linear regression models, visible light (RGB) indices outperformed multispectral or structural data. A linear model based on the red ratio vegetation index (VI) accumulated over shrub area could model biomass (calibration R-2= 0.888; validation R-2= 0.774) nearly as well as the top multivariate linear regression models (calibration R-2= 0.896; validation R-2> 0.750), which combined an accumulated RGB VI with a multispectral metric. The excellent performance of accumulated RGB VIs represents a novel approach to fine-scale vegetation biomass estimation, fusing spectral and spatial information into a single parsimonious metric that rivals the performance of more complex multivariate models. Methods developed in this study will be relevant to researchers interested in estimating fine-scale shrub aboveground biomass within a range of ecosystems.

AB African rainforests (ARFs) are species rich and occur in two main rainforest blocks: West/Central and East Africa. This diversity is suggested to be the result of recent diversification, high extinction rates and multiple vicariance events between west/central and East African forests. We reconstructed the diversification history of two subtribes (Annickieae and Piptostigmateae) from the ecologically dominant and diverse tropical rainforest plant family Annonaceae. Both tribes contain endemic taxa in the rainforests of West/Central and East Africa. Using a dated molecular phylogeny based on 32 nuclear markers, we estimated the timing of the origin of East African species. We then undertook several diversification analyses focusing on Piptostigmateae to infer variation in speciation and extinction rates, and test the impact of extinction events. Speciation in both tribes dated to the Pliocene and Pleistocene. In particular,Piptostigma(13 species) diversified mainly during the Pleistocene, representing one of the few examples of Pleistocene speciation in an African tree genus. Our results also provide evidence of an ARF fragmentation at the mid-Miocene linked to climatic changes across the region. Overall, our results suggest that continental-wide forest fragmentation during the Neogene (23.03-2.58 Myr), and potentially during the Pliocene, led to one or possibly two vicariance events within the ARF clade Piptostigmateae, in line with other studies. Among those tested, the best fitting diversification model was the one with an exponential speciation rate and no extinction. We did not detect any evidence of mass extinction events. This study gives weight to the idea that the ARF might not have been so negatively impacted by extinction during the Neogene, and that speciation mainly took place during the Pliocene and Pleistocene.

AB The international trade in lion (Panthera leo) products, particularly bone, has increased substantially over the last decade. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has established a zero-export quota for wild-origin lion bones. Whilst the trade of lion bone is permittable from captive-bred South African populations, there is no established method to differentiate between captive and wild-sourced lion derivatives in trade. This study acts as a preliminary investigation, by examining the stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope composition of hair from wild and captive lion populations as well as wild prey animals in South Africa, to judge the accuracy and applicability of this method for future bone analysis. Isotopic values for delta N-15 are found to be significantly enriched in some wild populations, however it is not possible to discriminate between captive and wild populations using delta C-13 analysis alone. Using the classification algorithm k-Nearest Neighbour, the origin of simulated data was identified with 70% accuracy. When using the model to test the origin of seized samples, 63% were classified as of wild origin. Our study indicates the potential for stable isotope analysis to discriminate between captive and wild populations. Additional study of captive husbandry, and analysis of bone samples from populations of a known origin and feeding regime is recommended to improve the utility of this method for maintaining transparency in trade.

AB Atlantic lowland heath (ALH) is a priority conservation habitat in Western Europe, but restoration efforts have met with mixed success due to the complexity associated with replicating establishment conditions. By virtue of their impoverished, often acidic soils and geographic location in areas naturally occupied by ALH communities, former kaolinite mine sites may offer an excellent opportunity for heathland restoration. Using a chronosequence of former open cast kaolinite mines in South West England (0, 2, 27, and 150 years since mining ceased), we determined the ability of ALH vegetation and soils to reestablish naturally and in addition, for the three youngest sites, how the reinstatement of stored overburden affected heathland regeneration. Analysis of soil characteristics revealed major differences in the levels of acidity, organic content, and fertility between abandoned kaolinite sites and a nearby natural reference heath. Even 150 years after mining ceased, concentrations of all major soil nutrients and organic content were lower, and pH higher, than undisturbed ALH. The reinstatement of overburden did little to improve soil quality, since all former kaolinite sites were dominated by mesotrophic grasses, rather than species characteristic of the target ALH community. We conclude that to maximize the potential of former open cast kaolinite sites for ALH reestablishment, changes in pre- and postrestoration management are required. These include modification of how overburden is stockpiled, while the addition of organic material, microbial communities, and sulfur (to reduce soil pH) to reinstated overburden are likely also essential interventions to facilitate successful ALH establishment.

AB Here we present an assessment of eddy activity in a 3,500 x 2,000 km region of the North Pacific. Eddies were identified and tracked within a numerical simulation that used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model and an eddy characterization algorithm. Spatially, eddy births were more frequent: (1) nearshore (cyclones) and offshore (anticyclones) on the windward side of the main Hawai'ian Islands; (2) in patches of cyclones and anticyclones that resembled the dipole structure of wind stress curl along the islands' leeward side; and (3) in zonal patches of eddies of both polarities west and north of the islands. Temporally, high eddy activities occurred in spring. There was a meridional distribution of eddy lifespans, which increased northward. Cyclones were more abundant, longer-lived, smaller, and more nonlinear. Reef fish spawning locations in Hawai'i coincide with the regions of high eddy activity, with nonlinear eddies responsible for high larval retention.
   Plain Language Summary It has been well documented that rotating bodies of water-the so-called cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies-heavily influence biological productivity in the North Pacific. However, the dynamics of eddy formation and activity are not always clear, often lacking spatial resolution and statistical evaluation. Here we used a general circulation model and an eddy detection tool to provide a comprehensive description of ocean eddies in a 3,500 x 2,000 km region of the North Pacific. Our analysis revealed seasonality in eddy genesis for the whole region, with more eddies forming in spring. Eddy generation west of the Big Island of Hawai'i is consistent with the mechanism of formation by the strong dipole of wind stress curl. Notably, there are marked spatial patterns of eddy rotations, sizes, propagation speeds, and lifespans on both sides of the main Hawai'ian Islands. This work also sheds light on the linkages between eddy activity and retention of larval fish in the Hawai'ian Archipelago. Spawning sites of coral reef fish in Hawai'i coincide with most of the regions of high eddy activity. Interestingly, regardless of eddy polarity, nonlinear slow-propagating (fast swirling) eddies enhance larval retention while linear fast-propagating (slow-swirling) eddies enhance larval export and eventually larval dispersion.
   Key Points
   Eddy generation in the North Pacific is highest in spring and lowest in fall except for the regions alongside the main Hawaiian Islands Mean anticyclone eddy intensity is significantly weaker than cyclone eddy intensity Regardless of eddy polarity, nonlinear (linear) eddies enhance larval retention (export) in island population of coral reef fish

This study represents the first in-depth review of ball python hunting being carried out by rural communities in Togo for nearly 15 years. Our approach, focused at the bottom of the trade chain, permitted extensive detailed data to be collected from hunters, and provides a unique insight into the practices, drivers and impacts associated with this type of large-scale commercial wildlife trade activity. We show that ball python hunting remains an economically valuable endeavour for these rural hunters. However, it also highlights a number of potential legal, conservation and animal welfare issues associated with the current hunting practices being carried out in Togo (and neighbouring range States) to supply the snake farms and ultimately the international exotic pet trade. Our findings suggest that the methods applied on the ground do not accurately reflect those being reported to national authorities and international regulatory mechanisms such as CITES. This irregular, if not illegal, trade may also be unsustainable, as suggested by hunters reporting that there are fewer ball pythons in the wild than there were five years previously. We recommend that additional scientific investigation (focusing on the size and status of the wild population), better management, and enforcement of regulations, are required to ensure that ball python populations are managed in a sustainable, legal and traceable way.

AB Biological invasions are a growing threat to global biodiversity due to negative impacts on native biota and ecosystem functioning. Research has expanded from investigating native and alien species interactions to examining relationships among alien species. Invasive crayfish may have similar life histories, niche preferences, and adaptation strategies, but their mutual interactions are little understood. This study aimed to quantify interaction patterns of size-matched calico crayfish Faxonius immunis, established in the Rhine River catchment, and the parthenogenetic marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis, currently spreading throughout Europe. During agonistic interactions in the absence of shelter, marbled crayfish won a significant majority of fights against calico crayfish, but in the presence of shelter there was no significant difference. When sex of calico crayfish was considered in the analysis without shelter, marbled crayfish won a significantly higher number of fights with female calico crayfish. In the absence of shelter, marbled crayfish dominated calico crayfish females in 83.3% and males in 60% of pairs. With available shelter, the dominance of marbled crayfish was 100% and 54.5% over female and male calico crayfish, respectively. The results suggested that sex and resource availability influence agonistic behaviour in the studied crayfish. Marbled crayfish are confirmed to be competitive against the calico crayfish, which has been shown to be dominant over another serious invader in the Rhine River catchment, the spiny-cheek crayfish Faxonius limosus. In natural sympatric populations, the situation may be affected by factors such as size, reproductive variables, water temperature, and predation pressure.

AB Large herbivore communities around the world have declined steeply in recent decades. Although excessive bushmeat harvesting is thought to be the primary cause of herbivore declines in many ecosystems, the direct effects of anthropogenic pressures on large herbivore populations remain poorly described in most of the systems experiencing decline. To test the extent to which large herbivores are impacted by ecological and anthropogenic factors in a protected area (PA) thought to be experiencing human-caused decline, we fit distance sampling models to seven years of data from systematic ground-based surveys in Kafue National Park (KNP) to estimate the population densities and distributions of 10 species of large herbivores, and to test what factors affect these parameters. Population densities of the ten most abundant large herbivores in KNP were substantially lower than those reported for an ecologically similar PA with less poaching pressure. Low densities were consistent across species and areas, though there was ecologically important variation among species and size classes. Densities of larger-bodied herbivores were greatly depressed relative to smaller species. This pattern has direct and indirect effects on large carnivore populations, with broad implications for the ecotourism and trophy hunting industries. Statistically and methodologically rigorous methods to test the effects of anthropogenic and environmental variables on density and distribution exist, but are rarely applied to large herbivores. To quantify trends in herbivore populations and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation actions, our results show that distance sampling with stratified ground-based monitoring is an efficient and effective method. In the Greater Kafue Ecosystem (GKE), continued increases in resource protection are needed to facilitate the recovery of an economically and ecologically important large herbivore guild. More broadly, our results confirm that anthropogenic effects on large herbivore distribution and abundance can be strong over wide areas for all species (particularly the larger members of the guild), even in very large PAs.

AB Production of tobacco by small holder farmers in Zimbabwe after the year 2000 land reform programme impacted woodlands due to the widespread use of fuel wood instead of coal for tobacco curing, but impacts have been rarely quantified. We assessed the effect of fuel wood harvesting for tobacco curing on structure, composition and diversity in harvested and unharvested miombo woodlands in the central watershed of Zimbabwe. Tree size class distributions provide demographic information on regeneration and recovery from disturbances. Vegetation structure and plant species composition were assessed in thirty 20 x 20 m plots in each site. Tree basal area, canopy cover and height were significantly higher in the less disturbed unharvested compared with harvested site. Species composition differed between harvested and unharvested sites, with higher diversity in the harvested compared with unharvested site. Trees had reverse-J-shaped size class distribution curves for both stem diameter and height at the harvested site and bimodal distributions with fairly large densities in larger size daises at the unharvested site. Recruitment and regeneration were higher in the harvested than unharvested site. Our findings show that harvesting fuel wood for tobacco curing has negative effects on tree structure, but not yet the diversity of the miombo woodland, however the latter will likely negatively impact tree species favoured for harvesting over the medium-long term. When species composition was compared using NMDS ordination, the harvested and unharvested plots were distinctly separated. Because of the rotational time for miombo woodlands of > 25 years, continuous harvesting of the woodland may permanently keep the trees small, failing to provide sufficient wood for tobacco curing. Therefore, there is need for the consideration of alternative or supplementary sources of energy such as solar, with a zero deforestation in the production chain of tobacco in the whole miombo eco-region.

AB ContextAustralia has a high diversity of endemic vertebrate fauna. Yet, transnational human activities continue to increase the rate of transportation, introduction and establishment of new alien vertebrates in Australia, to the detriment of environmental and socioeconomic services. Eradication of invasive vertebrates is often costly and without guarantee of success; therefore, methods for detecting, intercepting and preventing the transport of alien species earlier in the invasion pathway provide substantial benefit. AimTo anticipate emergent threats to Australian biosecurity posed by the transport and introduction of new alien vertebrates over time. MethodsWe collated vertebrate interception data from various mainland Australian State, Territory and Commonwealth government reporting agencies, including data from a previously published study, at both pre-border and post-border stages from 1999 to 2016. Using generalised linear and generalised additive modelling, we predicted trends in interception frequency using predictors such as vertebrate taxa, detection category and alien status. Key resultsInterception frequency increased over time for all vertebrate classes, for pre-border stowaways and for post-border captive and at-large interceptions, with no saturation in the accumulation of new species over time. Five species were responsible for almost half of all incidents, of which red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) and corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) are prominent in Australia's illegal alien pet trade. Rose-ringed parakeets (Psittacula krameri) are prominent in the legal alien cage-bird trade, which remains poorly regulated. Asian common toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) were frequently detected as stowaways, and most stowaway incidents originated from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, via shipping. Data deficiency for pre-border incidents increased rapidly in 2015 and 2016. ConclusionsAustralia is subject to a persistent and increasing risk of alien vertebrate introductions and incursions over time, owing partly to emergent trends in the alien pet trade as well as increased global trade and tourism. ImplicationsThe future of Australia's biosecurity remains dependent on stringent border security to prevent the arrival of novel species, but our findings also highlight the importance of ongoing management and control of high-risk species already present, often illegally, within Australia.

AB Interactions between plant community members are an underexplored driver of angiosperm floral variation. We investigate character displacement as a potential contributor to floral variation in Pelargonium communities. Pelargoniums all place pollen on the ventral sides of their pollinators, potentially leading to interspecific pollen transfer (IPT) in sympatry. We show that the positions of pollen placement and receipt are determined by anther and style exsertion lengths. Using field experiments, we demonstrate that heterospecific species experience higher IPT if they have similar style lengths than when they have greater style length differences. Using crosses, we show that IPT has negative consequences on seed set. In combination, these results suggest that character displacement in style length is likely to reduce IPT and increase female fitness in sympatry. Patterns of style length variation across 29 different Pelargonium communities suggest that character displacement has occurred in multiple communities. Furthermore, analyses using a wide-ranging species pair show that style lengths are more different between sympatric populations than they are between allopatric populations. In addition to pollinators as agents of floral divergence, this study suggests that variation in Pelargonium community structure has driven style length variation through character displacement.

AB The increasing rate of glacier retreat and turbid glacial runoff can have a strong influence on freshwater ecosystems. Seton and Anderson lakes (British Columbia, Canada) are sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) nursery systems. Since the 1940s, the Bridge River Diversion (BRD) introduced glacially turbid water into Seton Lake. To assess the impact of the BRD on the production of Seton Lake, we combined data from limnological surveys with the analysis of subfossil cladocerans and diatoms from sediment cores, using Anderson Lake as a reference. The modern data indicate that the euphotic zone is 14 m shallower and the cladoceran density and biomass are significantly lower in Seton Lake in comparison with Anderson Lake. The paleo-data indicate that following the BRD, the sedimentary fluxes of cladoceran and diatom declined 2- to 10-fold in Seton Lake and remained low thereafter. Together, our data support declines in primary and secondary producers following the BRD, likely due to changes in light penetration and (or) other indirect influence, and provides insights into the impact of turbid meltwater on the biological production of downstream lakes.

AB Background Harvesting of forest products is a widespread driver of disturbance in developing nations, where policies are increasingly aimed at managing natural forests for sustainable use. There is thus need for research aimed at understanding the impact of resource use on forest habitats and concomitant effects on biodiversity. Afromontane forests in the Eastern Cape, South Africa are harvested informally for poles and medicinal bark and occur along elevational gradients of 800-1600 m above sea level. Patterns of spatial diversity and human disturbance are expected to be affected by elevation. Furthermore, species' responses to disturbance are expected to vary depending on their level of habitat specialisation. Understanding harvest impacts on forest biodiversity thus requires disentangling the separate effects of elevation and disturbance, and considering forest-specialist and forest-generalist species separately. This study comprises two components. First, harvest activities, resultant harvest-mediated habitat heterogeneity, and avifaunal species richness, composition and beta-diversity were compared across two elevational zones in a harvested forest. Second, the role of harvest-mediated habitat heterogeneity in driving patterns of avifaunal diversity were assessed, while controlling for elevation, and considering forest-specialist and forest-generalist species separately. Results Harvest rates were higher, and activities more varied in the lower elevation zone, with significant impacts of harvesting on habitat features resulting in higher harvest-mediated habitat heterogeneity at lower elevations. Harvest-mediated increases in habitat heterogeneity positively affected forest-generalist species richness, while forest-specialist richness was negatively affected. While species composition of both groups differed across elevational zones, variation in harvest-mediated habitat heterogeneity did not fully account for this, suggesting that factors other than disturbance shape avifaunal communities along the elevation gradient. However, variation in harvest-mediated habitat heterogeneity accounted for the amount of beta-diversity attributed to species turnover in the forest-specialist assemblage, indicating that harvest disturbances affect the mechanisms driving beta-diversity of this group. Conclusion Spatial patterns of avifaunal diversity are affected by elevation over a 300-m gradient. Harvesting results in increased habitat heterogeneity, which variably affects avifaunal communities at the forest-scale, with positive effects for forest generalists and negative effects for forest-specialists.

AB Public reason is a formal concept in political theory. There is a need to better understand how public reason might be elicited in making public decisions that involve deep uncertainty, which arises from pernicious and gross ignorance about how a system works, the boundaries of a system, and the relative value (or disvalue) of various possible outcomes. This article is the third in a series to demonstrate how ethical argument analysis-a qualitative decision-making aid-may be used to elicit public reason in the presence of deep uncertainty. The first article demonstrated how argument analysis is capable of probing deep into a single argument. The second article demonstrated how argument analysis can analyze a broad set of arguments and how argument analysis can be operationalized for use as a decision-making aid. This article demonstrates (i) the relevance of argument analysis to public reasoning, (ii) the relevance of argument analysis for decision-making under deep uncertainty, an emerging direction in decision theory, and (iii) how deep uncertainty can arise when the boundary between facts and values is inescapably entangled. This article and the previous two make these demonstrations using, as an example, the conservation and sustainable use of lions.

AB Surface mining disturbs hundreds of hectares of land every year in many areas of the world, thereby altering valuable, ecologically-diverse forests. Reforestation of these areas after mining helps to restore ecosystem functions and land value. In Appalachia, native topsoil is normally replaced on the surface during reclamation, but waivers allow for brown and gray sandstone materials to be used as topsoil substitutes. Numerous studies report the growth of trees in these substitute mine soil materials, but few studies have compared the height of trees grown in reclaimed mine soils to the heights of trees grown in native soils. This study determined the growth of red oak (Q. rubra L.), white oak (Quercus alba L.), and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) in two mine soil types which were compared to projected growth in native soils. Heights of tree seedlings in native soils at 11 years were estimated from site indices (SI) from USDA Soil Survey data. At the mine sites, areas with brown and gray mine soils (one site with a mulch treatment) had 12 tree species planted and growth was measured annually for 11 years. Mine soil pH after 11 years was 5.3 for brown mine soils, 6.6 for gray mine soils, 7.0 for mulched mine soils, and 4.1 to 5.2 for native forest soils. After 11 years, tree heights in gray mine soils were significantly lower (0.5 m) than tree heights in brown mine soils (2.8 to 4 m) for all three species. Trees in mulched mine soils were up to 0.7 m taller than trees in un-mulched brown mine soils. After 11 years, red oak height was 6.3 m in native soils and 3 m in brown and mulched mine soils (52% lower); white oak was 7.3 m tall in native soils compared to 3.6 m in brown mine soils (50% lower); and tulip poplar was 11.5 m tall in native soils and 3.5 to 4 m tall in brown and mulched mine soils (70% lower). In gray mine soils, trees were not growing at all. While the trees in brown mine soils are growing, tree growth has not reached projected levels of tree growth in native soils during the first 11 years after planting. The purpose of forestry reclamation is to restore ecosystem diversity and function. This study showed that one measure of ecosystem function, tree growth, was 50% lower on reclaimed mine soils than native forest soils. Maturing mine soils may develop properties over time that are similar to native soils and, with the increased rooting depth, may provide conditions where increased tree growth rates and height may be attained during the next several decades.

AB Vegetation is critical for coastal dune building and stabilization. However, dune vegetation can suffer significant damage from coastal hazards such as hurricanes, anthropogenic disturbances, and tidal flooding. The goal of this study was to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of dune vegetation at South Padre Island, Texas, and to use changes in the landscape structure to better understand dune vegetation recovery from the impact of the 2008 Hurricane Dolly and overall dune vegetation resilience. Remotely sensed imagery was used in the format that was publicly available as Digital Orthophoto Quarterly Quadrangles captured from 1996 to 2016. Landscape metrics were used to quantify dune vegetation spatial structure and changes in the amount of and spatial distribution of dune vegetation. Results from classified images before and after Hurricane Dolly showed only a 5% decrease in dune vegetation cover in the 0.5-km(2) study area; however, there was a 48% decrease in patch density (from 6890 patches/100 ha to 3589 patches/100 ha) and a 25% decrease in edge density (from 2035 m/ha to 1521 m/ha), respectively. The less aggregated vegetation on the seaward side was more vulnerable to hurricane impact than the larger and more aggregated patches shielded by the crests of foredunes. Despite the disturbance of the 2008 Hurricane Dolly, vegetation cover in this dune region gradually increased by 38% from 1996 to 2016. Aggregation and the largest patch indices also increased during this period. Patch density decreased between 2004 (10,075 patches/100 ha) and 2016 (3605 patches /100 ha) after an initial increase from 1996 (3594 patches/100 ha). Growth trends pre- and post-Hurricane Dolly were strongly correlated, suggesting dune vegetation recovery and resilience. Overall, South Padre Island dune vegetation has appeared to maintain a steady increase in productivity over the last two decades regardless of routine tidal incursions.

AB Remotely sensed time-series data have provided valuable information and sound foundations for ecological sustainability studies. Ecosystem sustainability has been viewed as a dynamic process that requires an ecosystem to deal with climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Following this school of thought, ecosystem sustainability can be portrayed in terms of order and disorder using spatio-temporal analysis of entropy-related indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series. Information theory and entropy-related measures have provided insights for complex systems analysis and have high relevance in ecology; however, less attention has been focused on temporal evolution and dynamics. The overall aim of this study is to propose an index called 'temporal information entropy' (H-t), and it is an entropy-related index able to describe the degree of order and regularity within a time-series of observations. We then assess H-t's ability to measure the ecosystem sustainability of Yanhe watershed based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI time-series. Our results indicate that temporal information entropy of ecological time-series data may be used as a natural indicator with respect to sustainability, and in some degree, it helps us to get a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics from a physical-based standpoint.

AB Background and Aims Flower colour plays a major role in the attraction and decision-making of pollinators. Different functional groups of pollinators tend to prefer different flower colours, and therefor may lead to different flower colour compositions among different communities depending on the visual system of the dominant pollinators. However, few studies have investigated the linkage between pollinator fauna and flower colour composition in natural communities, a theme we explored in the present study.
   Methods Flower spectral reflectance of 106 Japanese and 96 New Zealand alpine plants in the wavelength range 300-700 nm were measured. The composition of pollinator fauna in the communities and the types of pollinators for each plant species were also investigated.
   Key Results Based on bee and fly colour vision models, as well as a principal components analysis, considering phylogenetic non-independence between plant species, flower colours appeared to vary according to pollinator type rather than geographical region. Consequently, flower colour composition differed between the regions, reflecting the bee/fly mixed pollinator fauna of Japan and the fly-dominant pollinator fauna of New Zealand. According to the bee colour vision model, the majority of the colours of hymenopteran-pollinated flowers appeared to be discriminated by bees. In contrast, many of the colours of dipteran-pollinated flowers would not be discriminated by bees and flies.
   Conclusion The results suggest that the differences in flower colour composition between Japanese and New Zealand alpine communities are due to differences in the pollinator fauna in these communities rather than differences in abiotic factors between the geographical regions and the phylogenetic origin of the communities.

AB Scotland has the highest concentration of private land ownership in Europe and private estates in the Highland region cover the vast majority of the land. On many private estates forests share the land with a strong tradition of sporting use that has inhibited the development of forest management culture. Land managers are seeking ways to diversify that are relevant to both local practice and wider environmental issues to align with Scottish woodland expansion policy, increasing emphasis on resilience strategies and adoption of ecosystem approaches. This research focusses on four regionally diverse case study areas, each containing three neighbouring private estates in the Scottish Highlands. Using mixed-methods that includes an adapted walking interview technique, collaborative action discussions and a novel approach to mapping spatial resilience this study explores resilience and forest culture through individual perceptions of the participating land managers. This work expands understanding of spatial resilience that is relevant and meaningful to land manager decision-making and local practice, which could offer policy makers with an effective avenue to realise and implement resilience aims through local action. Key synergies between renewable energy, carbon marketing and forest development are identified alongside perceptions of resilient forest types. Support mechanisms such as regionally trusted capacity building and facilitation are recognised as crucial to mobilising six landscape partnerships (land manager identified) that could both strengthen estate and forest resilience.

AB Woody biomass remains the primary energy source for domestic use in the developing world, raising concerns about woodland sustainability. Yet woodland regenerative capacity and the adaptive response of harvesters to localised fuelwood shortages are often underestimated or unaccounted for in fuelwood supply-demand models. Here, we explore the rates and patterns of height-specific woody vegetation structural dynamics in three communal lands in a semiarid savanna in South Africa. Using repeat, airborne light detection and ranging, we measured height-specific change in woody vegetation structure, and the relative influence of geology, fire, and ease of access to fuelwood. Monitoring 634,284 trees canopies over 4 years revealed high compensatory growth, particularly in the high wood extraction communal land: 34.1% of trees increased in height >1 m. Vegetation structural patterns were associated with ease of access to the communal land but were mediated by wood extraction intensity. In these communal lands, vegetation structural dynamics show rapid woody thickening as a response to repeat harvesting. However, loss of height in vegetation structure did not follow a gradient of wood extraction intensity. We propose a conceptual framework to better understand change in vegetation structural metrics and the paradoxical phenomenon of high growth in high wood extraction scenarios. We also show coadaptive responses of humans and woody vegetation to fuelwood harvesting in human-environment systems through patterns of regrowth response relative to ease of access to fuelwood resources.

AB The endangered Amur tiger Panthera tigris altaica is confined primarily to a narrow area along the border with Russia in northeast China. Little is known about the foraging strategies of this small subpopulation in Hunchun Nature Reserve on the Chinese side of the border; at this location, the prey base and land use patterns are distinctly different from those in the larger population of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains of Russia. Using dietary analysis of scats and camera-trapping data from Hunchun Nature Reserve, we assessed spatiotemporal overlap of tigers and their prey and identified prey selection patterns to enhance understanding of the ecological requirements of tigers in northeast China. Results indicated that wild prey constituted 94.9% of the total biomass consumed by tigers; domestic livestock represented 5.1% of the diet. Two species, wild boar Sus scrofa and sika deer Cervus nippon, collectively represented 83% of the biomass consumed by tigers. Despite lower spatial overlap of tigers and wild boar compared to tigers and sika deer, tigers preferentially preyed on boar, likely facilitated by high temporal overlap in activity patterns. Tigers exhibit significant spatial overlap with sika deer, likely favoring a high level of tiger predation on this large-sized ungulate. However, tigers did not preferred roe deer Capreolus pygargus and showed a low spatial overlap with roe deer. Overall, our results suggest that tiger prey selection is determined by prey body size and also overlap in tiger and prey use of time or space. Also, we suggest that strategies designed to minimize livestock forays into forested lands may be important for decreasing the livestock depredation by tigers. This study offers a framework to simultaneously integrate food habit analysis with the distribution of predators and prey through time and space to provide a comprehensive understanding of foraging strategies of large carnivores.

AB Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) rely on an abundant and diverse selection of floral resources to meet their nutritional requirements. In farmed landscapes, mass-flowering crops can provide an important forage resource for bumblebees, with increased visitation from bumblebees into mass-flowering crops having an additional benefit to growers who require pollination services. This study explores the mutualistic relationship between Bombus terrestris L. (buff-tailed bumblebee), a common species in European farmland, and the mass-flowering crop courgette (Cucurbita pepo L.) to see how effective B. terrestris is at pollinating courgette and in return how courgette may affect B. terrestris colony dynamics. By combining empirical data on nectar and pollen availability with model simulations using the novel bumblebee model Bumble-BEEHAVE, we were able to quantify and simulate for the first time, the importance of courgette as a mass-flowering forage resource for bumblebees. Courgette provides vast quantities of nectar to ensure a high visitation rate, which combined with abundant pollen grains, enables B. terrestris to have a high pollination potential. While B. terrestris showed a strong fidelity to courgette flowers for nectar, courgette pollen was not found in any pollen loads from returning foragers. Nonetheless, model simulations showed that early season courgette (nectar) increased the number of hibernating queens, colonies, and adult workers in the modeled landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Courgette has the potential to improve bumblebee population dynamics; however, the lack of evidence of the bees collecting courgette pollen in this study suggests that bees can only benefit from this transient nectar source if alternative floral resources, particularly pollen, are also available to fulfill bees' nutritional requirements in space and time. Therefore, providing additional forage resources could simultaneously improve pollination services and bumblebee populations.

AB Wildland fire is an understudied yet highly important disturbance agent on the Indian subcontinent. In particular, there is uncertainty regarding the degree to which annual climate variation influences inter-annual variability in fire activity. In this study, we evaluate wildland fire at two complementary spatial scales in the southern portion of the Western Ghats mountain range (hereafter Western Ghats') in India. At the larger regional scale, we evaluate temporal and spatial variability in fire activity from 2001 to 2015. At the smaller scale, we evaluate the relationship between annual area burned and climate variation within two landscapes nested within the Western Ghats (from c. 1996 to 2015). At the regional scale, we found that most fire activity was restricted to January-March, although substantial inter-annual variation was evident. For example, in 2004, 2009 and 2012, fire activity was approximately five times greater compared with the 3 years with the lowest fire activity. The landscape-scale analysis also revealed weak to strong correlations between annual area burned and climate variation in both landscapes. Although not the only factor influencing area burned, episodes of drought could be exerting an increasingly significant effect on wildfire activity in the Western Ghats.

AB In the past two decades, avian influenzas have posed an increasing international threat to human and livestock health. In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of poultry and hundreds of people. The two main means of international spread are through migratory birds and the live poultry trade. We focus on the role played by the live poultry trade in the spread of H5N1 across three regions widely infected by the disease, which also correspond to three major trade blocs: the European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Across all three regions, we found per-capita GDP (a proxy for modernization, general biosecurity, and value-at-risk) to be risk reducing. A more specific biosecurity measure-general surveillance-was also found to be mitigating at the all-regions level. However, there were important inter-regional differences. For the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc live poultry imports were risk reducing while extra-bloc imports were risk increasing; for ECOWAS the reverse was true. This is likely due to the fact that while the EU and ASEAN have long-standing biosecurity standards and stringent enforcement (pursuant to the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), ECOWAS suffered from a lack of uniform standards and lax enforcement.

AB Understanding how climate change and land transformation may impact the distribution and diversity of wildlife species requires landscape-level foundational biodiversity surveys. The Karoo BioGaps Project aims to provide such data and to support the scientific assessment for shale gas development projects in the Karoo basin. In this paper we present the findings of the BioGaps mammal survey, which recorded medium and large mammals across twenty-five 1 km x 1 km sampling sites within the proposed fracking footprint using camera trapping techniques. We use sample rarefaction curves, non-parametric species richness estimators and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots to explore both species richness and community structure. We also used a generalised linear model to investigate how species diversity varies with both site-specific and landscape-level predictors. A total of 38 species were recorded at the majority of sites. Longitude (z = 4.018, p = 0.0005) emerged as the best predictor of species diversity across the study area, which we suggest is linked to the clear east-west aridity gradient. Together these results reveal the cosmopolitan distribution of the mammal taxa in the Karoo and could be used to inform decision-making linked to mining activities in the area.

AB To understand how foraging decisions impact individual fitness of herbivores, nutritional ecologists must consider the complex in vivo dynamics of nutrient-nutrient interactions and nutrient-toxin interactions associated with foraging. Mathematical modeling has long been used to make foraging predictions (e.g. optimal foraging theory) but has largely been restricted to a single currency (e.g. energy) or using simple indices of nutrition (e.g. fecal nitrogen) without full consideration of physiologically based interactions among numerous co-ingested phytochemicals. Here, we describe a physiologically based model (PBM) that provides a mechanistic link between foraging decisions and demographic consequences. Including physiological mechanisms of absorption, digestion and metabolism of phytochemicals in PBMs allows us to estimate concentrations of ingested and interacting phytochemicals in the body. Estimated phytochemical concentrations more accurately link intake of phytochemicals to changes in individual fitness than measures of intake alone. Further, we illustrate how estimated physiological parameters can be integrated with the geometric framework of nutrition and into integral projection models and agent-based models to predict fitness and population responses of vertebrate herbivores to ingested phytochemicals. The PBMs will improve our ability to understand the foraging decisions of vertebrate herbivores and consequences of those decisions and may help identify key physiological mechanisms that underlie diet-based ecological adaptations.

TI Ploughing friction on wet and dry sand
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID GRANULAR MEDIA; STRESSES
AB The friction for sliding objects over partially water-saturated granular materials is investigated as a function of the water volume fraction. We find that ploughing friction is the main sliding mechanism: The slider leaves a deep trace in the sand after its passage. In line with previous research and everyday experience, we find that the friction force varies nonmonotonically with the water volume fraction. The addition of a small amount of water makes the friction force sharply drop, whereas too much added water causes the friction force to increase again. We present a ploughing model that quantitatively reproduces the nonmonotonic variation of the friction force as a function of water volume fraction without adjustable parameters. In this model, the yield stress of the water-sand mixture controls the depth to which the hemisphere sinks into the sand and the force that is required to plough through the water-sand mixture. We show that the model can also be used for other ploughing friction experiments, such as an ice skate that leaves a ploughing track on ice.

AB Long-term population data of marine invaders are rarely collected although it provides fundamental knowledge of the invasion dynamics that is important for evaluating the impacts, interactions and range expansion of the invader and for management purposes. During a 6-year monitoring period, we studied the dynamics and population demographic characteristics of the newly introduced mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii. The overall abundance of R. harrisii appeared to follow the boom and bust pattern with a rapid initial abundance increase and subsequent decline. The recruitment and growth of juveniles were correlated with the temperature during the larval period indicating that the increase in water temperature caused by climate change could have a positive effect on the recruitment and have potentially facilitated the establishment of R. harrisii in the northern Baltic Sea. The changes in the survival of reproductive females influence most the growth rate of the studied population. Hence, native predators feeding on benthic fauna such as fish could regulate the population growth of R. harrisii in the study area by reducing female survival. Although the population size seems to be stabilized at the monitoring locations, R. harrisii continues to expand its distribution range, and the rapid initial population increase is likely occurring at newly invaded sites.

ID GUT MICROFLORA; ABALONE; ALGINATE; PHYLOGENIES; ALIGNMENT; BACTERIA;

AB Haliotis discus hannai, a species of Pacific abalone, is a highly valuable food source throughout Northeast Asia. As H. discus hannai primarily feed on brown algae and largely extract their energy from algal polysaccharides, understanding the mechanisms by which they digest algal polysaccharides is essential for elucidating their energy metabolism. Gut microbes, as well as the host animal, are involved in the process of polysaccharide degradation. To identify algal polysaccharide-digestion mechanisms and their origin, we analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of abalone visceral extracts. Microbial communities were characterized using the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the metagenome and our results differed significantly from those of previous studies using traditional microbiological methods such as bacterial cultivation and cloning. A greater diversity of bacterial taxa was identified here than was previously identified using cultivation methods. Furthermore, the most abundant bacterial taxa also differed from previous studies, which is not common when comparing the results of bacterial culturing with those of molecular methodologies. Based on the metatranscriptome, overall functions were identified and additional analyses were performed on the coding sequences of algal polysaccharide-digestive enzymes, including alginate lyase. Results of the transcriptomic analyses suggest that alginate lyase in the visceral extracts of H. discus hannai was produced by the host itself, not by visceral bacteria. This is the first next-generation sequencing study performed on abalone to characterize the visceral microbiota and the source of the ability to digest algal polysaccharides by analyzing the metagenome and metatranscriptome together.

AB Knowledge of spatial patterns of biological diversity is fundamental for ecological and biogeographical analyses and for priority setting in nature conservation, particularly in West Africa where the existing high biodiversity is increasingly threatened by human activities. The maximum entropy approach was used to model the geographic distribution of 3,393 vascular plant species at a spatial resolution of 0.0833 degrees. Species richness decreases along temperature and precipitation gradients with high species numbers in the south and lower numbers towards the north of the transect. All centres of plant species diversity are confined to humid areas in concordance with the high positive correlation between species richness and rainfall which appears to be the most important delimiter for the distribution ranges of many species in the area. The effectiveness of the existing protected areas at regional and national levels is investigated based on the proportion of species covered. Considering the whole study area, 95% of all species are covered by protected areas according to their distribution ranges. However, the proportion of species covered is considerably lower for some countries such as Benin and Togo. Our results could provide guidance for essential land use management interventions to decision-makers and conservationists in the region.
   Resume La connaissance des schemas spatiaux de la diversite biologique est fondamentale pour les analyses ecologiques et biogeographiques et pour le choix de priorites en matiere de conservation de la nature, specialement en Afrique de l'Ouest oU la grande biodiversite actuelle est de plus en plus menacee par les activites humaines. L'approche par entropie maximale a servi pour modeliser la distribution geographique de 3393especes de plantes vasculaires a une resolution spatiale de 0,0833 degrees. La richesse en especes diminue le long des gradients de temperatures et de precipitations, avec un grand nombre d'especes au sud et un plus petit nombre au nord du transect. Tous les centres de diversite vegetale sont confines dans des zones humides, en accord avec la grande correlation positive entre la richesse en especes et les chutes de pluie qui semblent etre le plus important delimiteur pour les aires de repartition de nombreuses especes dans la region. Nous etudions l'efficacite des aires protegees existantes au niveau regional et national en nous basant sur la proportion d'especes couvertes. En considerant toute la zone etudiee, 95% de toutes les especes sont couvertes par des aires protegees selon leurs aires de repartition. Cependant, la proportion d'especes couvertes est considerablement plus faible pour des pays comme le Benin et le Togo. Nos resultats pourraient donner aux decideurs et aux conservationnistes de la region des orientations pour des interventions essentielles en matiere de gestion des sols.

AB Despite the significance of invertebrate species in the alien and invasive faunas of both sub-Antarctic and, increasingly, some Antarctic locations, little information exists on the numbers and identity of species being transported to the Antarctic region. Here we provide information on a decade (2006/2007-2016/2017) of detections in the surveillance program established at Scott Base in the Ross Sea region of continental Antarctica. The program found 233 individuals in 134 detection events, belonging to at least 14 Orders and 51 Families. Among these were alien, pest and synanthropic species recorded elsewhere on the globe or in the broader Antarctic region. These included sciarid flies known to have established in station sewage-treatment plants elsewhere on the continent. Flies, spiders and moths were most commonly detected, and typically in food (60% of interceptions), and then in clothing and equipment (11%), aircraft and cargo (11%) and packaging material (11%). Detected groups were similar to those found in the two other extensive surveillance efforts (King George Island and East Antarctica), highlighting the need to continue and improve surveillance across the region. For invertebrates, further control of the supply chain prior to embarkation of cargo and personnel may be the most effective management option to prevent further transport of non-indigenous species to the Antarctic.

AB Understanding patterns of marine connectivity in oceanic islands is a fundamental element for conservation and management of fished species. In the present study, the level of connectivity of the endemic lobster Panulirus pascuensis Reed, 1954 from remote islands in the southern Pacific Ocean was estimated, focusing on the Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMH), considered here as a source of recruits to Easter Island. The connectivity of adult lobster populations between Eastern Island (EI) and Salas y Gomez Island (SG), in the center of MMH, was studied by quantifying the reciprocal migration rates using variability of microsatellite loci and a biophysical individual-based model of larval transport based on the outputs of a regional high-resolution oceanic model. Considering a system composed only of adult populations located in both islands, the genetic analysis showed that 3% of the adults from EI came from SG; however, only 0.02% in the opposite direction. Neglecting the effect of other islands (e.g., Pitcairn Island located at 2000 km west of EI), the self-recruitment was estimated at 97% in EI and 99.8% in SG. The results of the Lagrangian analysis of the oceanic model simulations are consistent with the concept of asymmetric connectivity, although there is appreciable variation in recruitment among years. Both genetic and oceanographic approaches revealed large variance in connectivity from SG to EI. The asymmetric connectivity from SG to EI emphasizes the importance of the MMH Marine Park for lobster conservation in SG, and that it also supports recruitment of P. pascuensis to EI.

AB The goal of this study was to examine the responses of the zooplankton community to the establishment of an OWF, the causes of any observed effects, and their relation to environmental factors in the study area. This article describes the results of an investigation into the zooplankton community and the main environmental factors affecting that community based on data obtained from three cruises in May, August, and November of 2015 in the area of the Longyuan OWF in Rudong, China. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of zooplankton, including data obtained before the construction of the wind farm, to assess any postconstruction change in the zooplankton community. Data from the zooplankton community were analyzed using canonical correlation analysis, redundancy analysis, and multiple regression analysis. The analysis indicates that the presence of the wind turbine foundations reduced the quantity of the macrozooplankton significantly (the percentage of change was 96.87% in the autumn, and 26.70% in the spring), and reduced the biomass slightly in autumn (the percentage of change was -58.20%) or increased the biomass in the spring (the percentage of change was 75.77%). However, the quantity of the microzooplankton significantly increased (the percentage of change was 542.76% in the spring) or decreased slightly (the percentage of change was -86.25% in the autumn). The water also showed a postconstruction trend toward eutrophication in this study area. The data also showed that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, suspended matter concentration, and pH were the most important factors influencing the zooplankton community. The suspended-matter concentration had opposite effects on the macrozooplankton and microzooplankton, suggesting that the postconstruction zooplankton community might show a trend toward miniaturization.

AB Tropical dry forest (TDF) is important due to its biodiversity. In the Isthmus-Coastal region of the state of Oaxaca. in Southeast Mexico, there are many areas of TDF with varying categories of legal protection (1) Protected Natural Areas (PNA). (2) Voluntarily Designated Conservation Areas (VDCA) and (3) Areas of Common Use (ACU). In each of these, tree vegetation structure was analysed, recording plants with a DBH >= 2.5 cm and sampling 15 plots of 100 m(2). Observed richness was 90 species, belonging to 36 families and corresponding to 80 % (Jackknife) and 85 % (ICE) of expected richness. A cluster analysis identified two groups with 90 % dissimilitude: the first (G1) included all the sampled plots in the PNA, and the second (G2), grouped together those from the VDCA and the ACU. The Shannon, Simpson dominance and Jost true diversity indices for GI were H'= 2.43, D= 0.21 and D-q= 11 and for G2. H'= 2.76, D= 0.28 and D-q= 15 respectively, with no differences between groups (P < 0.05). The species that presented the highest relative importance value (RIV) in both groups, corresponded to secondary vegetation. Species density of G1 was 1 829 ind/ba and 2 370 ind/ha for G2. Mean height (6.8 m) and basal area (19.7 m(2)/ha) of G1 did not vary significantly (P < 0.05) when compared to G2 (7.9 m y 22.1 m(2)/ha). The VDCA and ACU presented similar composition and structure, differing from the PNA. Continual monitoring of the TDF is suggested.

   CONVERGENCE; PATTERNS
AB Question: Functional plant traits often express consistent changes along ecological gradients and, hence, are often used as indicators of environmental change (e.g. nutrient availability, temperature changes). Besides being driven by edaphic conditions, functional plant composition is filtered by herbivory, and traits responsive to nutrient availability often coincide with those related to palatability or resistance to browsing. We hypothesized that herbivory may distort the ways in which traits are expressed along environmental gradients.
   Location: Bialowieza National Park, Poland.
   Methods: We used a long-term controlled, exclosure experiment in the Bialowieza National Park to study tree functional trait expression and plant indicator values, with and without large ungulate browsing, along a natural soil fertility gradient.
   Results: Browsing largely reduced the functional diversity of regenerating trees, indicated by multivariate analysis and Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RQE), and altered how several traits change with increasing fertility. Browsing led to an increase in specific leaf area (SLA) on poorer sites. RQE showed a hump-backed trend along the fertility gradient, indicating the largest functional diversity at intermediate fertility. However, this pattern was not affected by browsing. Unlike the morphological tree traits, trends of light and N plant indicator values along the gradient were unaffected by browsing.
   Conclusions: These results highlight how the expression of plant traits resulting from one driver (soil fertility) can be modified by another driver (herbivory,) and stress the importance of taking herbivory into account when using plant traits as indicators of large-scale processes (e.g. climate change). Furthermore, the results suggest that plant indicator values may be more robust towards these effects, while compiled indices such as RQE could mask considerable functional turnover. Several traits (e.g. SLA) are strongly connected to nutrient cycling. The development, driven by browsing, towards higher SLA on poorer sites may thus cause a positive feedback effect on site fertility that drives an increase in nutrient availability. This may in turn have implications for ecosystem functionality. Hence, the large reduction in functional diversity revealed at the scale of this study may in the long term have implications on multiple ecosystem processes.

AB Habitat choice is an important decision that influences animals' fitness. Insect larvae are less mobile than the adults. Consequently, the contribution of the maternal choice of habitat to the survival and development of the offspring is considered to be crucial. According to the "preference-performance hypothesis", ovipositing females are expected to choose habitats that will maximize the performance of their offspring. We tested this hypothesis in wormlions (Diptera: Vermileonidae), which are small sand-dwelling insects that dig pit-traps in sandy patches and ambush small arthropods. Larvae prefer relatively deep and obstacle-free sand, and here we tested the habitat preference of the ovipositing female. In contrast to our expectation, ovipositing females showed no clear preference for either a deep sand or obstacle-free habitat, in contrast to the larval choice. This suboptimal female choice led to smaller pits being constructed later by the larvae, which may reduce prey capture success of the larvae. We offer several explanations for this apparently suboptimal female behavior, related either to maximizing maternal rather than offspring fitness, or to constraints on the female's behavior. Female's ovipositing habitat choice may have weaker negative consequences than expected for the offspring, as larvae can partially correct suboptimal maternal choice.

AB The number of non-indigenous aquatic species (NIS) has rapidly increased globally. The majority of published evidence on the effects of NIS on local communities is from single species studies in which the interactive effects of NIS are not considered. Here we present experimental evidence of separate and interactive effects of two widespread non-indigenous benthic predators, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the North American mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) on benthic invertebrate communities in a shallow coastal ecosystem of the Gulf of Riga, the Baltic Sea. The two species have recently colonized multiple sub-basins of the Baltic Sea and due to their rapid range expansion, increasing densities and local functional novelty, they are expected to have strong separate or interactive effects on native communities. Our laboratory experiment demonstrated that round goby and mud crab exerted a significant predation pressure on different benthic invertebrate species and the effects of the studied predators were largely independent. Predation was stronger at higher temperature compared with low temperature treatment. Among the studied invertebrate species gammarid amphipods were consumed the most. Interestingly, round goby did not prey on the mud crabs despite a large size difference of the studied predators.

AB Local adaptation, the differential success of genotypes in their native versus foreign environments, can influence ecological and evolutionary processes, yet its importance is difficult to estimate because it has not been widely studied, particularly in the context of interspecific interactions. Interactions between ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi and their host plants could serve as model system for investigations of local adaptation because they are widespread and affect plant responses to both biotic and abiotic selection pressures. Furthermore, because EM fungi cycle nutrients and mediate energy flow into food webs, their local adaptation may be critical in sustaining ecological function. Despite their ecological importance and an extensive literature on their relationships with plants, the vast majority of experiments on EM symbioses fail to report critical information needed to assess local adaptation: the geographic origin of the plant, fungal inocula, and soil substrate used in the experiment. These omissions limit the utility of such studies and restrict our understanding of EM ecology and evolution. Here, we illustrate the potential importance of local adaptation in EM relationships and call for consistent reporting of the geographic origin of plant, soil, and fungi as an important step towards a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of EM symbioses.

AB In animal surveys, detectability can vary widely across species. We hypothesized that detectability of animals should be a function of species traits such as mass, color, and mean herd size. We also hypothesized that models of detectability based on species traits can be used to predict detectability for new species not in the original data set, leading to substantial benefits for ecology and conservation. We tested these hypotheses with double-observer aerial surveys of 10 mammal species in northern Botswana. We combined all 10 species and modeled their detectability with species traits (mass, mean herd size, color) as predictors while controlling for observer effects, vegetation, and herd size. We found support for effects of mass and an interaction between herd size and mean herd size on detectability. This model accurately predicted the ratio of herds detected by two observers vs. one observer for 8 of 10 species. To test whether a model based on species traits could be applied to a new species, we serially deleted each species from the data set, fit a trait-based model to the remaining nine species, and used this model to predict detectability for the deleted species. The model was able to reproduce the species-trait model for seven species and accurately predicted the ratio of detections by one or two observers for a different set of seven species; the model was successful by both measures for five species. To our knowledge, this represents the first time that a mechanistic model for detectability of animals has been used to predict detectability for new species. Prediction failed for species with extreme values of traits, suggesting that predicting detectability is not possible near or beyond the boundaries of one's data set. The approach taken in this paper can potentially be used with a variety of taxa and may provide new opportunities to apply detectability corrections where they have not been possible before.

AB Spatial association between pine recruitment and shrubs is widely observed in dry environments and often associated with physical facilitation provided by the shrub, alleviating seedling drought stress. However, shrubs may also facilitate recruitment by sheltering seeds from granivores. In this study we investigated the influence of shrub-related microsites on post-dispersal pine seed survival in dry Mediterranean shrubland. We present a novel approach investigating the survival of single seeds in the context of long-distance wind dispersal. In four dry shrubland sites of central Israel, we placed seeds of Pinus halepensis in different microsites associated with Sarcopoterium spinosum shrubs: under canopy, at two margins and in between shrubs. We monitored the seed persistence monthly, replacing seeds removed by granivores. We also compared seed survival in burned vs. unburned areas. Logistic regression showed that seeds placed under shrubs had significantly higher survival rates than elsewhere. In unburned sites survival was higher than in burned sites and remained higher under shrub canopies. We show that these effects were substantial by considering the length of the season through which seeds need to persist. We conclude that shrubs constitute an important facilitator for Pinus halepensis colonization in dry shrubland through their positive effect on seed survival. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Savanna tree species vary in the magnitude of their response to grass competition, but the functional traits that explain this variation remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we grew seedlings of 10 savanna tree species with and without grasses in a controlled greenhouse experiment. We found strong interspecific differences in tree competitive response, which was positively related to photosynthesis rates, suggesting a trade-off between the ability to grow well under conditions of low and high grass biomass across tree species. We also found no competitive effect of tree seedlings on grass, suggesting strong tree-grass competitive asymmetry. Our results identify a potentially important trade-off that enhances our ability to predict how savanna tree communities might respond to variation in grass competition.

AB Habitat complexity plays a vital role in shaping ecological communities, but many coral reef ecosystems are shifting to alternative states with altered community compositions and reduced complexity. Sea urchins are common inhabitants of reefs, and their importance for controlling the distribution and abundance of algae in marine ecosystems is well understood. Less understood is the role of habitat complexity and species identity of foundational species in dictating the abundance of reef herbivores. We explored how the structural complexity and identity of 3 corals commonly observed on contemporary Caribbean reefs mediate the abundance, behavior, and demographic characteristics of an increasingly important herbivore, the sea urchin Echinometra viridis. Tethered urchins survived better on the more structurally complex coral Agaricia tenuifolia and hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis than on less complex branching Porites species. However, natural densities of urchins on these corals did not follow the same pattern, suggesting that coral identity, independent of complexity, also contributes to habitat associations. In habitat choice experiments, urchins preferred the structurally complex coral A. tenuifolia only when waterborne cues of predators were introduced. Despite minimal differences in the standing stock of algae associated with the different corals, urchins inhabiting Porites colonies had a marginally higher reproductive condition than those collected from the other corals, suggesting a fitness trade-off to inhabiting the riskier coral. Understanding the drivers of herbivore habitat associations is vital for predicting the persistence of coral-dominated reefs due to feedbacks between changing coral reef communities (both species identity and habitat complexity) and shifts to algal dominance.

AB Seabird excrements (guano) have been preserved in the arid climate of Northern Chile since at least the Pliocene. The deposits of marine organic material in coastal areas potentially open a window into the present and past composition of the coastal ocean and its food web. We use the stable isotope composition of nitrogen and carbon as well as element contents to compare the principal prey of the birds, the Peruvian anchovy, with the composition of modern guano. We also investigate the impact of diagenetic changes on the isotopic composition and elemental contents of the pure ornithogenic sediments, starting with modern stratified deposits and extending to fossil guano. Where possible, C-14 systematics is used for age information. The nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition of the marine prey (Peruvian anchovy) of the birds is complex as it shows strong systematic variations with latitude. The detailed study of a modern profile that represents a few years of guano deposition up to present reveals systematic changes in nitrogen and carbon isotopic composition towards heavier values that increase with age, i.e. depth. Only the uppermost, youngest layers of modern guano show compositional affinity to the prey of the birds. In the profile, the simultaneous loss of nitrogen and carbon occurs by degassing, and non-volatile elements like phosphorous and calcium are passively enriched in the residual guano. Fossil guano deposits are very low in nitrogen and low in carbon contents, and show very heavy nitrogen isotopic compositions. One result of the study is that the use of guano for tracing nitrogen and carbon isotopic and elemental composition in the marine food web of the birds is restricted to fresh material. Despite systematic changes during diagenesis, there is little promise to retrieve reliable values of marine nitrogen and carbon signatures from older guano. However, the changes in isotopic composition from primary marine nitrogen isotopic signatures towards very heavy values generate a compositionally unique material. These compositions trace the presence of guano in natural ecosystems and its use as fertilizer in present and past agriculture.

AB Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) are important components of forest ecosystems; they affect tree growth and influence nutrient cycling as caterpillars, provide food for higher trophic levels as caterpillars and adults, and are pollinators as adults. Here, we report on and compare the results of two long-term studies of the effects of logging on Lepidoptera in oak hickory forests. In one study, the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP), caterpillars were used as response taxa. Sampling via observation without removal focused on larvae found on leaves of two dominant tree species, Quercus alba and Q velutina, in alternative harvest regimes. In a second, the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment of Indiana (HEE), we examined the response of adults to alternative harvest levels by sampling with blacklighting. Caterpillar sampling in MOFEP and in an associated chronosequence revealed that clearcutting decreases numbers and diversity of Lepidoptera, year effects were as important in influencing caterpillar assemblages as the harvest per se, and that species richness of caterpillars continued to increase each year post-harvest. When using adult moths as response taxa, species composition was resilient to timber harvest under shelterwood management, recovering to the near original condition three years post treatment. Communities in patch cut or clear cut stands were slower to recover, and appeared to develop novel communities relative to their pre-harvest condition. A late spring frost decreased abundance and species richness of caterpillars, while a severe drought impacted adult lepidopterans, depressing species richness in patch cut stands to a greater degree than in control or shelterwood cut stands. Together, these results demonstrate that Lepidoptera communities in oak-history forests respond immediately to logging due to changes in host plant availability, but may also be impacted many years subsequent due to stochastic year effects and seral changes in forest structure and composition.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Local ecological conditions influence the impact of species interactions on evolution and community structure. We investigated whether pollinator-mediated interactions between coflowering plants vary with plant density, coflowering neighbor identity, and flowering season.
   METHODS: We conducted a field experiment in which flowering time and floral neighborhood were manipulated in a factorial design. Early- and late-flowering Clarkia unguiculata plants were placed into arrays with C. biloba neighbors, noncongeneric neighbors, additional conspecific plants, or no additional plants as a density control. We compared whole-plant pollen limitation of seed set, pollinator behavior, and pollen deposition among treatments.
   KEY RESULTS: Interactions mediated by shared pollinators depended on the identity of the neighbor and possibly changed through time, although flowering-season comparisons were compromised by low early-season plant survival. Interactions with conspecific neighbors were likely competitive late in the season. Interactions with C. biloba appeared to involve facilitation or neutral interactions. Interactions with noncongeners were more consistently competitive. The community composition of pollinators varied among treatment combinations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator-mediated interactions involved competition and likely facilitation, depending on coflowering neighbor. Experimental manipulation helped to reveal context-dependent variation in indirect biotic interactions.

AB Our study discusses how literature, in particular an autobiographical novel, can be approached as a valuable reservoir of social-ecological memory (SEM). Through our analysis of acclaimed Korean writer Park Wan-suh's autobiographical novel Who Ate Up All the Shinga?, we discuss how an individual (the author) manifests ecoliteracy, place attachment, and identity in relation to Korea's traditional village landscape that can serve as a suitable setting for understanding Korea's local social-ecological contexts. We find a rich account of knowledge and practices related to living and ecological components, resource and landscape management systems, social institutions, and worldviews. The author's descriptions of her native village landscape show the role of village resource and landscape management practices in enhancing local biodiversity and developing ecoliteracy in relation to indigenous ecosystem-like concepts. In addition, several social capitals are mentioned as key to sustaining the village community. The author's knowledge of local plants is the result of her childhood experiences in nature, and her place attachment is tightly linked with her worldview that is cultivated through intricate human-nature relationships within the Korean traditional village landscape. Furthermore, the novel contributes to comprehending resilience thinking by providing a narrative of social changes and interactions between humans and nature. Thus, SEM retained in literature can facilitate a meaningful understanding of social-ecological contexts in a given social-ecological system. Our study therefore suggests new functions of autobiographical memory in literary work for delivering SEM, and informs the study of SEM across the fields of humanities, social sciences, and natural resources management.

AB Ethiopia has established protected areas throughout the country and designated many areas of land in order to conserve the natural resources and biodiversity. Hence, identification of the diversity in these protected areas is essential for conservation and management purposes. The study was conducted with the objective to investigate and document the floristic composition and plant community types of Maze national park. A preferential sampling technique was used as a sampling design and a total of 65 plots with a size of 20 m x 20 m (400 m(2)) were laid out for the woody species; a sub-plot of 5 m x 5 m was used at the center of each quadrat to assess the herbaceous species. A total of 144 species of vascular plants belonging to 109 genera and representing 37 families with, 40%, 37%, 17%, and 6% herbs, trees, shrubs and climbers respectively were recorded and identified. The most diverse family was Fabaceae followed by Poaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Asteraceae. Combretum adenogonium, Rhus natalensis, Panicum maximum, are the most frequently occurring tree layer, shrub layer and herb layer plant species respectively. The output of TWINSPAN (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis) has shown a cluster of 6 plant community types. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) has shown that there was statistically significant difference among plant communities in species richness, altitude, diversity and evenness at 95% confidence interval with a P value < 0.05. Anthropogenic activities in Maze National Park were identified to exert high pressure on the vegetation and wildlife in the area resulting in the loss of biodiversity underpinned by troubled natural habitat. The most feasible recommendation to reverse the undesirable condition in the national park is to actively participate the local people in the conservation activities of the national park via ecotourism which is one form of sustainable tourism.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To determine population pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin in purple sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus) administered an intracoelomic injection of enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) or immersed in an enrofloxacin solution (5 mg/L) for 6 hours.
   ANIMALS
   28 sea stars of undetermined age and sex.
   PROCEDURES
   The study had 2 phases. Twelve sea stars received an intracoelomic injection of enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) or were immersed in an enrofloxacin solution (5 mg/L) for 6 hours during the injection and immersion phases, respectively. Two untreated sea stars were housed with the treated animals following enrofloxacin administration during both phases. Water vascular system fluid samples were collected from 4 sea stars and all controls at predetermined times during and after enrofloxacin administration. The enrofloxacin concentration in those samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. For each phase, noncompartmental analysis of naive averaged pooled samples was used to obtain initial parameter estimates; then, population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed that accounted for the sparse sampling technique used.
   RESULTS
   Injection phase data were best fit with a 2-compartment model; elimination half-life, peak concentration, area under the curve, and volume of distribution were 42.8 hours, 18.9 mu g/mL, 353.8 mu g.h/mL, and 0.25 L/kg, respectively. Immersion phase data were best fit with a 1-compartment model; elimination half-life, peak concentration, and area under the curve were 56 hours, 36.3 mu g.h/mL, and 0.39 mu g/mL, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Results suggested that the described enrofloxacin administration resulted in water vascular system fluid drug concentrations expected to exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration for many bacterial pathogens.

AB Border control is one of the major approaches used by countries to limit the number of organisms introduced as stowaways. However, it is not feasible to inspect all passengers, cargo and vehicles entering a country, and so efforts need to be prioritised. Here we use South Africa as a case study to assess, based on tourism and trade data and climate matching techniques, the number of stowaway species that might be introduced ('colonisation pressure') and the likelihood that once introduced, these organisms will establish ('likelihood of establishment'). These results were used to explore how the number of species that are likely to establish ('establishment debt') varies across donor regions and seasons. A simple theoretical model was then used to compare four strategies for prioritising border control inspections: no prioritisation; based on colonisation pressure; based on likelihood of establishment; and based on both colonisation pressure and likelihood of establishment. Establishment debt was greatest in southern hemisphere spring and autumn when South Africa is climatically similar to northern hemisphere countries with which there are strong, consistent trade and tourism links (i.e. colonisation pressure varied little seasonally, but likelihood of establishment did vary across the seasons). Prioritising inspections based on both colonisation pressure and the likelihood of establishment was clearly the most effective strategy, with this strategy detecting at least 6% more potential invaders than the other strategies. While there are many practical limitations to the implementation of such prioritised inspection strategies, the results highlight the importance of national and regional studies of establishment debt.

AB As multi-use conservation landscapes, biosphere reserves (BRs) exemplify the landscape mosaic approach to environmental decision-making. In this study, time-series remotely-sensed data (1993-2006-2012) were used to monitor vegetation transformation in the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve (K2C) of South Africa, updating previous land-cover research. We identified changes in spatial extent, rate and intensity of land-cover change and extrapolated observed trends to 2018. The increased rate of change in the recent observation period (2.3 vs. 5.7%) was driven by more intensive gains in impacted vegetation and settlement since 2006 (>210 km(2) and >120 km(2)), with resultant transformation of intact habitat undermining regional connectivity. By 2012, intact vegetation had suffered losses of 6.3% (>350 km(2)) since 2006 and >14% (>750 km(2)) since 1993. A further 9.5% loss of intact habitat may represent a critical threshold, establishing K2C above the 50% threshold of landscape transformation, whereafter a rapid decline in landscape resilience is likely. Given the BR's spatial zonation, such a loss across the full extent of K2C is unlikely, at least in the short-term (i.e., by 2018). Yet, based on past trends of transformation in the unprotected transition zone, anticipating such losses in the longer term, is not unfounded (i.e., 2024).

A 210-cm core extracted from the lake periphery yielded high diatom fossil concentrations for the upper 174 cm. Princessvlei appears to oscillate between two ecologically stable states, namely, a state characterised by clear water, oligotrophic, benthic communities and a turbid state dominated by eutrophic, planktonic species. The two stable ecological states are interpreted to be a function of the relative dominance of catchment precipitation or groundwater influx which augments the open water conditions. From 2600 to 1500 cal. BP (173-135 cm), the system is predominantly turbid with greater moisture availability before a relatively rapid development of oligotrophic and dilute conditions from 1300 to 610 cal. BP (135-30 cm). A brief period of deeper water depths and meso-eutrophic conditions is observed between 550 and 445 cal. BP (23-13 cm). Following a short-lived hiatus, poly-hypertrophic, alkaline species are abundant in the top 10 cm coinciding with European colonisation in the region from the 17th century.

AB The effect of transforming natural habitat to commercial land uses can be mitigated by implementing ecological networks (ENs) in production landscapes. However, EN ability to conserve biodiversity is potentially influenced by past and present disturbances, and spatial configuration of habitat patches. Here, we investigated how plant assemblages of a subtropical EN in a timber production landscape in South Africa respond to disturbance history (i.e. natural vs. recovering after removal of Pinus spp.), mowing in firebreaks (i.e. 30 m wide grassy strips intended to stop spread of fires in plantations), and three design parameters: corridor width, distance to protected area boundary, and context i.e. proportion eucalypt compartments within 500 m radius. Reference sites were in the adjacent iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a protected area (PA). Past disturbances and the current practice of mowing in firebreaks significantly influenced plant species composition, but not plant species richness. Plant dominance was greatest in mowed firebreaks, but similar between natural and recovering grassland. None of the design variables affected plant species richness, or composition. However, dominance was significantly and negatively correlated with corridor width, and positively correlated with context. Hence, sites are ordered in terms of their biodiversity value from greatest to lowest: natural areas > recovering areas > firebreaks. Based on these results, natural grassland in wide, well-connected corridors should have greatest conservation priority. We recommend that past disturbances, and current management practices should be taken into account and integrated into the design of future ENs. Such an approach is necessary for effective biodiversity conservation in production landscapes.

AB There is a dearth of knowledge on the effects of annual burning of fire-breaks on species composition, plant diversity and soil properties. Whittaker's plant diversity technique was used to gather data on species composition and diversity in four grassland communities on the Loskop Dam Nature Reserve (LDNR). The study demonstrated that fire-beaks did not have a negative effect on plant diversity and an increase was even noted in various diversity parameters in the grassland on abandoned cropland. Fire-breaks were changing the species composition, as three of the four communities illustrated a clear separation in species composition between fire-break and unburnt plots. There was not a strong association between specific species and the fire-break or unburnt plots, except for Themeda triandra and Tristachya leucothrix, known for their association with and without fire, respectively. The change in species composition was not negatively affecting range condition. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were slightly lower in the fire-break than unburnt soils, but the reduced concentrations were unlikely to cause severe soil degradation in fire-break zones. From a management perspective, fire-breaks appear to be a sustainable management tool as they are not adversely affecting plant diversity or range condition in the grassland association on LDNR.

AB Guano is an important source of marine-derived nutrients to seabird nesting areas. Seabirds usually present high levels of metals and other contaminants because the bioaccumulation processes and biotic depositions can increase the concentration of pollutants in the receiving environments. The objectives of this study were to investigate: the toxicity of seabird guano and the joint toxicity of guano, Cu and Pb by using the sea urchin embryo-larval bioassay. In a first experiment, aqueous extracts of guano were prepared at two loading rates (0.462 and 1.952 g L-1) and toxicity to sea-urchin embryos was tested. Toxicity was low and not dependent of the load of guano used (EC50 0.42 +/- 0.03 g L-1). Trace metal concentrations were also low either in guano or in aqueous extracts of guano and the toxicity of extracts were apparently related to dissolved organic matter. In a second experiment, the toxicity of Cu-Pb mixtures in artificial seawater and in extracts of guano (at two loadings: 0.015 and 0.073 g L-1), was tested. According to individual fittings, Cu added to extracts of guano showed less toxicity than when dissolved in artificial seawater. The response surfaces obtained for mixtures of Cu and Pb in artificial seawater, and in 0.015 g L-1 and 0.073 g L-1 of guano, were better described by Independent Action model adapted to describe antagonism, than by the other proposed models. This implied accepting that EC50 for Cu and Pb increased with the load of guano and with a greater interaction for Cu than for Pb. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the impacts of consumers on the abundance, growth rate, recovery and persistence of their resources across their distributional range can shed light on the role of trophic interactions in determining species range shifts. Here, we examined if consumptive effects of the intertidal grazer Scurria viridula positively influences the abundance and recovery from disturbances of the alga Mazzaella laminarioides at the edge of its geographic distributions in northern-central Chilean rocky shores. Through field experiments conducted at a site in the region where M. laminarioides overlaps with the polar range edge of S. viridula, we estimated the effects of grazing on different life stages of M. laminarioides. We also used long-term abundance surveys conducted across similar to 700 km of the shore to evaluate co-occurrence patterns of the study species across their range overlap. We found that S. viridula had positive net effects on M. laminarioides by increasing its cover and re-growth from perennial basal crusts. Probability of occurrence of M. laminarioides increased significantly with increasing density of S. viridula across the range overlap. The negative effect of S. viridula on the percentage cover of opportunistic green algae-shown to compete for space with corticated algae-suggests that competitive release may be part of the mechanism driving the positive effect of the limpet on the abundance and recovery from disturbance of M. laminarioides. We suggest that grazer populations contribute to enhance the abundance of M. laminarioides, facilitating its recolonization and persistence at its distributional range edge. Our study highlights that indirect facilitation can determine the recovery and persistence of a resource at the limit of its distribution, and may well contribute to the ecological mechanisms governing species distributions and range shifts.

AB The coral reefs of Tanga, Tanzania were recognized as a national conservation priority in the early 1970s, but the lack of a management response led to damage by dynamite, beach seines, and high numbers of fishers until themid 1990s. Subsequently, an Irish Aid funded IUCN Eastern Africa program operated from 1994 to mid 2007 to implement increasedmanagement aimed at reducing these impacts. Themain effects of this management were to establish collaborative management areas, reduce dynamite and seine net fishing, and establish small community fisheries closures beginning in 1996. The ecology of the coral reefs was studied just prior to the initiation of this management in 1996, during, 2004, and a few years after the project ended in 2010. The perceptions of resource users towards management options were evaluated in 2010. The ecological studies indicated that the biomass of fish rose continuously during this period from 260 to 770 kg/ ha but the small closures were no different from the non-closure areas. The benthic community studies indicate stability in the coral cover and community composition and an increase in coralline algae and topographic complexity over time. The lack of change in the coral community suggests resilience to various disturbances including fisheries management and the warm temperature anomaly of 1998. These results indicate that some aspects of the management program had been ecologically successful even after the donor program ended. Moreover, the increased compliance with seine net use and dynamite restrictions were the most likely factors causing this increase in fish biomass and not the closures. Resource users interviewed in 2010 were supportive of gear restrictions but there was considerable between-community disagreement over the value of specific restrictions. The social-ecological results suggest that increased compliance with gear restrictions is largely responsible for the improvements in reef ecology and is a high priority for future management programs.

AB To conserve indigenous natural ecosystem and help in the recovery of natural vegetation on Nakoudojima Island, which is a subtropical oceanic island in Ogasawara Islands in Japan, we clarified the mechanisms of the changes in soil chemical properties as affected by soil erosion and seabird activities on the island. Under grassland vegetation where influence of feral goat (exotic species) had been severe, the chemical properties of surface soils with a thickness of 5 cm were variable even in a small area of 0.375 km(2); pH(H2O) value range between 4.6 and 6.9, total C content range between 0.36 and 5.62%, total N content range between 0.03 and 0.45%, exchangeable acidity range between 0.5 and 50 mmol(c) kg(-1), and plant-available phosphate (Bray II P) range between 0.4 and 170 mg P2O5 100 g(-1). By clarifying soil profile characteristics under natural and disturbed vegetation and distribution patterns of these soils on the island, the changes in the soil chemical properties were reasonably assigned to the effect of soil erosion caused by feral goats for increased soil exchangeable acidity and decreased soil pH (mainly found in inland area) and to the effect of seabird activities for increased Bray II P and soil exchangeable acidity and decreased soil pH (mainly found in outer rim area with high altitude). It was also clarified that the high soil exchangeable acidity was significantly related to the low productivity of plant biomass for these plots (P<0.01). Soil erosion would have removed surface soils having weak acidity and exposed subsoils having strong acidity to the ground surface, resulting in inhibition of plant growth and delay of vegetation recovery. Based on the findings obtained in the present study, several options were proposed to stop soil erosion and to recover the vegetation, although careful preliminary examination would be necessary for applying them.

TI Application of Spatial and Closed Capture-Recapture Models on Known
   Population of the Western Derby Eland (Taurotragus derbianus derbianus)
   in Senegal

AB Camera trapping with capture-recapture analyses has provided estimates of the abundances of elusive species over the last two decades. Closed capture-recapture models (CR) based on the recognition of individuals and incorporating natural heterogeneity in capture probabilities are considered robust tools; however, closure assumption is often questionable and the use of an M-h jackknife estimator may fail in estimations of real abundance when the heterogeneity is high and data is sparse. A novel, spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) approach based on the location-specific capture histories of individuals overcomes the limitations of closed models. We applied both methods on a closed population of 16 critically endangered Western Derby elands in the fenced 1,060-ha Fathala reserve, Senegal. We analyzed the data from 30 cameras operating during a 66-day sampling period deployed in two densities in grid and line arrays. We captured and identified all 16 individuals in 962 trap-days. Abundances were estimated in the programs CAPTURE (models M-0, Mh and Mh Chao) and R, package secr (basic Null and Finite mixture models), and compared with the true population size. We specified 66 days as a threshold in which SECR provides an accurate estimate in all trapping designs within the 7-times divergent density from 0.004 to 0.028 camera trap/ha. Both SECR models showed uniform tendency to overestimate abundance when sampling lasted shorter with no major differences between their outputs. Unlike the closed models, SECR performed well in the line patterns, which indicates promising potential for linear sampling of properly defined habitats of non-territorial and identifiable herbivores in dense wooded savanna conditions. The CR models provided reliable estimates in the grid and we confirmed the advantage of Mh Chao estimator over Mh jackknife when data appeared sparse. We also demonstrated the pooling of trapping occasions with an increase in the capture probabilities, avoiding violation of results.

AB Perennial grasses are a dominant component of grasslands, and provide important ecosystem services. However, most knowledge of grasslands' functioning and production comes from plot-level studies, and drivers of individual-level production remain poorly explored. Extrapolation from existing experiments is hampered by the fact that these are mostly concentrated on even-aged cohorts, and/or on the early stages of a plant's life cycle. Here we explored how local density regulates individual production in mono-specific natural grassland, focusing on adult individuals of a perennial savanna grass (Stipagrostis uniplumis). We found individual production to increase with individuals' size, but to decrease with neighbour abundance. A metric of neighbour abundance that considered size was superior to a metric based solely on the number of individuals. This finding is particularly important for studying competitive effects in natural populations, where plants are normally not even-sized. The inferred competition kernel, i.e. the function describing how competitive strength varies with spatial distance from a target plant, was hump-shaped, indicating strongest intraspecific competition at intermediate distances (10-30 cm). The spatial signature of competitive effects changed with time since fire; peak effects moved successively away from the target plant. Our results suggest that inferred competition kernels of long-lived plant populations may have shapes that differ from exponential or sigmoidal decreases. More generally, results underline that competition among neighbouring plants is dynamic. Studies that address density-dependent and density-independent (fire-related) population dynamics of perennial grasses in their fire-prone environment may thus shed new light on the functioning and production of grasslands.

AB Background: The present work aimed to investigate the genetic structure of 11 edible herbs grown in the wild of eastern Crete that are becoming vulnerable due to habitat destruction and unregulated harvesting. Thirty three populations (268 individuals) of Reichardia picroides, Scolymus hispanicus, Scandix pecten-veneris, Leontodon tuberosus, Cichorium spinosum, Sonchus asper ssp. glaucescens, Urospermum picroides, Prasium majus, Hypochoeris radicata, Centaurea raphanina ssp. raphanina and Anagallis arvensis were collected and identified from nine regions with distinct microclimate (Lassithi prefecture), and their genetic composition was studied by means of RAPD markers.
   Results: A total of ten primers per population were used to detect genetic diversity and bootstrap analysis was conducted for clustering the samples. High levels of heterogeneity were revealed while the Analysis of Molecular Variance documented that variance was allocated mainly within populations and at a lesser extent among populations. Fst values among regions were moderate to high, suggesting partial population fragmentation. Bayesian structure analysis revealed fine genetic composition and substantial admixture between species present in different regions, although clustering was mainly geographically related.
   Conclusions: High altitude regions, with little residential and agricultural development (Kefala, Agrilos, Ziros and Tziritis), were the areas where high biodiversity was detected. On the other hand, coastal regions had lower biodiversity, probably due to degradation of their habitat.

AB This experimental microcosm study reports the influence of organic enrichments by mussel biodeposits on the metabolic activity and functional diversity of benthic prokaryotic communities. The different biodeposit enrichment regimes created, which mimicked the quantity of faeces and pseudo-faeces potentially deposited below mussel farms, show a clear stimulatory effect of this organic enrichment on prokaryotic metabolic activity. This effect was detected once a certain level of biodeposition was attained with a tipping point estimated between 3.25 and 10 g day(-1) m(-2). Prokaryotic communities recovered their initial metabolic activity by 11 days after the cessation of biodeposit additions. However, their functional diversity remained greater than prior to the disturbance suggesting that mussel biodeposit enrichment may disturb the functioning and perhaps the role of prokaryotic communities in benthic ecosystems. This manipulative approach provided new information on the influence of mussel biodeposition on benthic prokaryotic communities and dose-response relationships and may support the development of carrying capacity models for bivalve culture.

AB Caiman is one of the five extant genera of alligatorid crocodylians. While several quantitative and qualitative studies exist on morphological variation in the genus, little is known about ontogenetic effects. Here, we quantify ontogenetic variation in morphology for Caiman yacare and C. latirostris in a phylogenetic context. A linear regression analysis on twelve skull measurements of C. yacare and C. latirostris against a measure of size (the first axis of a PCA of all variables) showed high correlation coefficients (r(2)=0.89-0.99) and negative allometry. Eight allometric trajectories showed common slopes at different intercepts, reflecting a common ontogenetic pattern of morphological growth fixed early in ontogeny. The anterior width of the snout and the posterior width of the skull table are suitable to discriminate between the two species. The relationship between snout width and snout length is isometric in C. latirostris while it is negatively allometric in C. yacare. These results confirm that the snout shape is a distinctive feature between species established early in ontogeny. The narrowing and lengthening of the snout in C. yacare during ontogeny results in adult forms widely represented in other extant taxa within the genus. The broader and shorter snout in C. latirostris is probably an autapomorphic feature of this species within Caimaninae.

AB Human-induced gene movement via afforestation and restoration programs is a widespread phenomenon throughout the world. However, its effects on the genetic composition of native populations have received relatively little attention, particularly in forest trees. Here, we examine to what extent gene flow from allochthonous plantations of Pinus pinaster Aiton impacts offspring performance in a neighboring relict natural population and discuss the potential consequences for the long-term genetic composition of the latter. Specifically, we conducted a greenhouse experiment involving two contrasting watering treatments to test for differences in a set of functional traits and mortality rates between P. pinaster progenies from three different parental origins: (i) local native parents, (ii) exotic parents and (iii) intercrosses between local mothers and exotic fathers (intraspecific hybrids). Our results showed differences among crosses in cumulative mortality over time: seedlings of exotic parents exhibited the lowest mortality rates and seedlings of local origin the highest, while intraspecific hybrids exhibited an intermediate response. Linear regressions showed that seedlings with higher water-use efficiency (WUE, delta C-13) were more likely to survive under drought stress, consistent with previous findings suggesting that WUE has an important role under dry conditions in this species. However, differences in mortality among crosses were only partially explained by WUE. Other non-measured traits and factors such as inbreeding depression in the relict population are more likely to explain the lower performance of native progenies. Overall, our results indicated that intraspecific hybrids and exotic individuals are more likely to survive under stressful conditions than local native individuals, at least during the first year of development. Since summer drought is the most important demographic and selective filter affecting tree establishment in Mediterranean ecosystems, a potential early selective advantage of exotic and hybrid genotypes would enhance initial steps of introgression of non-native genes into the study relict population of P. pinaster.

AB The molecular identification of prey in faeces is an efficient non-invasive technique to study diet which requires both a satisfactory method of DNA extraction and the design of specific primers to selectively amplify prey's DNA. In this study we evaluated and compared the efficiency of two total DNA extraction methods and five primer pairs for the molecular identification of birds from scats, in particular from the giant noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus). A modified DNA stool Mini Kit of Qiagen was tested against a modified silica method with a guanidinium thiocianate (GuSCN) applied after freezing and pulverizing the samples. We also checked two published vertebrate- and bird-generalist primer pairs and three bird-specific primer pairs designed by us (two pairs targeting the cytochrome b and one the cytochrome oxidase subunit I genes) that amplified shorter DNA fragments. The results show that pulverizing the scat remains before extraction was a very important step, presumably facilitating access to the well preserved DNA located inside the rachis of the feathers. The combination of our bird-specific designed primers showed a higher amplification rate than the generalist primers and allowed successful bird identification from the feathers excreted by the giant noctule bat in all the scat samples analyzed, independent of the preservation method used (dried and frozen). These methodological improvements will allow not only the study of the avian diet composition of the enigmatic giant noctule, but the extension of this methodology to other bird predators such as raptors.

AB Acacia cyclops is a widespread invader in Mediterranean-climate regions. However, although its naturalization in the Mediterranean Basin dates back only a few years ago, and the invasion process has not been studied hitherto. We investigated seedlings recruitment strategy adopted by A. cyclops in a small island (Lampedusa, Italy) where its natural regeneration was strictly confined under mother plants canopy. Healthy plants (DCP), plants at incipient senescence (SCP) and dead plants (DP) were distinguished according to vitality and canopy status. Living plants were also characterized in relation to leaf C and N isotope composition. Regeneration pattern (seedlings and saplings abundance) was related to the microclimatic differences (soil temperature, air temperature and humidity, soil nutrients, light) observed between canopies and adjacent open areas, and among canopy types. Living canopies ensure milder conditions, reducing extreme values as well as fluctuations between night and day. However, beneath canopies (DP, SCP and DCP) seedlings may benefit from significantly higher soil nutrients content than in the outside, while light availability was much higher under DP. Saplings to seedlings ratio was found to be around 12 under DP, while under SCP it was slightly higher than 1, and just less than 0.5 under DCP. Moreover, saplings growth was significantly higher under SCP and DP, suggesting a prominent role of light in driving seedlings recruitment. Stable isotope analyses of C and N provided ecophysiological information in relation to changes in canopies structure. Thus, while seedling stage appears to be more nutrient-limited, subsequent sapling stage is much more light-limited. Although the species is not yet displaying an invasive spreading on the island, our study provides clear evidence that senescent canopies are better facilitators than healthy in preserving the invasive potential of A. cyclops. This finding suggests some best practices in order to gradually reduce the presence of the alien species within its pristine nuclei of introduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A mechanistic, dynamic model was developed to predict infection of loquat fruit by conidia of Fusicladium eriobotryae, the causal agent of loquat scab. The model simulates scab infection periods and their severity through the sub-processes of spore dispersal, infection, and latency (i.e., the state variables); change from one state to the following one depends on environmental conditions and on processes described by mathematical equations. Equations were developed using published data on F. eriobotryae mycelium growth, conidial germination, infection, and conidial dispersion pattern. The model was then validated by comparing model output with three independent data sets. The model accurately predicts the occurrence and severity of infection periods as well as the progress of loquat scab incidence on fruit (with concordance correlation coefficients >0.95). Model output agreed with expert assessment of the disease severity in seven loquat-growing seasons. Use of the model for scheduling fungicide applications in loquat orchards may help optimise scab management and reduce fungicide applications.

AB Predators have to deal with the problem of prey shifting during predator's ontogenesis. The ontogenetic shift in the prey capture of prey-specialized species should be associated with a change in their predatory traits. Here, we focused on the ant-eating Zodarion rubidum, a spider strictly specialized on ants. It uses potent venom to immobilize prey. We tested whether there is a change during the ontogenesis of the spider species in traits related to capture efficiency. We kept spiders from the juvenile to adult stage on a monotypic diet composed of one of four ant species, small and large ant species from two subfamilies. We tested the capture efficiency of all spiders at the beginning and at the end of the experiment after being reared on a certain ant species, and then we swapped the spiders and tested them with the other ant species. For each trial, we measured the number of attacks (bites) and the paralysis latency. Afterwards venom glands were extracted and analysed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 1D-SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. We found that spiders on all diets improved their capture efficiency during ontogenetic development. We hypothesize that the improvement was due to an increase in the amount of venom injected. Thus, we did not find an ontogenetic shift in the predatory traits. Nor was there a significant difference in the composition of low and high molecular weight venom compounds among diet groups, suggesting that the consumption of a prey has little effect on venom composition.

AB Previous research focusing on broad-scale or geographically invariant species-environment dependencies suggest that temperature-related variables explain more of the variation in reptile distributions than precipitation. However, species-environment relationships may exhibit considerable spatial variation contingent upon the geographic nuances that vary between locations. Broad-scale, geographically invariant analyses may mask this local variation and their findings may not generalize to different locations at local scales. We assess how reptile-climatic relationships change with varying spatial scale, location, and direction. Since the spatial distributions of diversity and endemism hotspots differ for other species groups, we also assess whether reptile species turnover and endemism hotspots are influenced differently by climatic predictors. Using New Zealand reptiles as an example, the variation in species turnover, endemism and turnover in climatic variables was measured using directional moving window analyses, rotated through 360 degrees. Correlations between the species turnover, endemism and climatic turnover results generated by each rotation of the moving window were analysed using multivariate generalized linear models applied at national, regional, and local scales. At national-scale, temperature turnover consistently exhibited the greatest influence on species turnover and endemism, but model predictive capacity was low (typically r(2) = 0.05, P < 0.001). At regional scales the relative influence of temperature and precipitation turnover varied between regions, although model predictive capacity was also generally low. Climatic turnover was considerably more predictive of species turnover and endemism at local scales (e. g., r(2) = 0.65, P < 0.001). While temperature turnover had the greatest effect in one locale (the northern North Island), there was substantial variation in the relative influence of temperature and precipitation predictors in the remaining four locales. Species turnover and endemism hotspots often occurred in different locations. Climatic predictors had a smaller influence on endemism. Our results caution against assuming that variability in temperature will always be most predictive of reptile biodiversity across different spatial scales, locations and directions. The influence of climatic turnover on the species turnover and endemism of other taxa may exhibit similar patterns of spatial variation. Such intricate variation might be discerned more readily if studies at broad scales are complemented by geographically variant, local-scale analyses.

AB Soil richness was examined across the Wisconsin ecological tension zone, which constitutes a transition between the central hardwood forest and prairie biomes to the south and the northern mixed hardwood and conifer forest biome to the north. There were greater numbers (normalized by county area) of soil orders, suborders, and great groups in counties within the transition zone than in those outside the zone. A zone of soils containing glossic horizons extends 75 km to the north of the Wisconsin transition zone separates Alfisols (dominantly Hapludalfs) and Mollisols in the south from Spodosols and Glossudalfs in the north; this zone may represent the mid-Holocene position of the tension zone. Soil endemism is a concept whereby soils are restricted to a limited geographic area based on a unique set of soil-forming factors. In this study, endemic soils were identified on the basis of having a centralized distribution, lacking competing soil series, and being unique to Wisconsin and adjoining states. Although the transition zone contains 13% of the state's area, it has 40% of the endemic soils. Endemic soils in Wisconsin occur in 7 orders, 14 suborders, 29 great groups, 83 subgroups, and 138 families: they include 159 soil series that cover 1.44 million ha (19% of state land area). The predominant soil properties related to soil endemism include (i) the presence of a glossic horizon (34% of endemic soils), (ii) aquic conditions or oxyaquic subgroups (28%), and (iii) bisequal profiles (20%). There are 102 vascular plant species endemic to Wisconsin, the distribution of which appears to be related more to the landform than to soil taxa. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maderia is a Portuguese Macaronesian island that is located in the Atlantic Ocean and frequently affected by natural hazards. Here, the concept of resilience is discussed as a dichotomous and place-based concept and as a way of achieving sustainability, sustainability being one of the main solutions for climate change. This paper will discuss the complexity of defining "resilience", the contradictions involved in its use and its positive and negative applications. In order to make resilience an operative concept, it is investigated within landscape research, in which landscape is considered to be the result of human and natural actions and their interaction. Here, landscape is considered as a holistic, place-based, bottomup concept that can be used as a unit of measure for community resilience. As a consequence of the kind of relationship that a community builds with the landscape in which it lives, we can encounter different kinds of lansdscapes: riskscapes, hazardscapes, resilientscapes, sustainable landscapes, etc. These landscapes are investigated in the context of the island of Madeira in order to identify the resilient actions of its community. To conclude, today, Madeira is a riskscape and often a hazardscape. The most recent incidents were the fires of 2013 and the flash flood of 2010, which was one of the worst events in the history of the archipelago. However, the first signs of resilience have been identified, which represent interesting examples of increasing awareness in both top-down and bottom-up ways. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Ornithogenic nutrients derived from waterbirds such as the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus, Lesson) have been linked to habitat change within nesting colonies. For the islands of Lake Erie, where increasing cormorant populations and subsequent habitat change have spurred management activity, estimates of the quantity and chemical characteristics of avian-derived contributions are lacking. To evaluate the quantity and chemical characteristics of omithogenic litterfall beneath a double-crested cormorant colony on a western Lake Erie island we investigated the mass of material and nutrient composition (PO43-, NO3- and NH4+) reaching the forest floor under three nest densities (Low: 1-96 nests ha(-1); Medium: 97-255 nests ha(-1) and High: >255 nests ha(-1)). As expected, litterfall (total mass) input differed among nest densities with the most substantial input (225.05 g/m(2) week(-1)) measured under High nest density conditions. Nutrient concentrations also showed increases with nest density to a point, where mean PO43- and NH4+ concentrations showed no differences between Medium and High nest density sites. As well, NO3- concentrations were highest under Medium density, with no differences in this nutrient observed between Low and High density. Collectively, litterfall nutrient composition was similar to those linked to habitat changes in other waterbird colonies. Similarities in the concentrations of several nutrients between Medium and High nest density categories suggest that management actions aimed at reducing allochthonous nutrient contributions should try to sustain nest density at or below 96 nests ha(-1).

AB Microcrustacean plankton was sampled in the Danube River just upstream and downstream of Budapest, a large city with considerable industrial and municipal discharges. I addressed the questions of whether (i) there is any longitudinal variation in the densities and community attributes of microcrustaceans, and (ii) how these relate to river flow and nutrient discharges. Microcrustacean densities and diversities varied significantly between upstream and downstream sites as well as between different hydrological phases. Densities recorded in high water upstream were comparable to those recorded downstream, densities in low water, however, were considerably higher downstream. High water was associated with increased densities and diversities. The number and relative abundance of tychoplanktonic species considerably increased in high water. All those findings suggest the importance of downstream transport from adjacent water bodies. Diversities did not experience a downstream decline, and the effects of waste water discharges cannot be detected irrespective of the flow regime. The results indicate that effects of waste waters are embedded within the river flow effect in such a way that the latter appears to mask the impact of nutrient loads. This study provides further evidence for the flow regime as a major driver of biodiversity in floodplain rivers.

AB Question In frequently disturbed habitats such as savannas, survival of seedlings and saplings depends on the species-specific ability to persist for a long time and to re-sprout following disturbances that are damaging to individuals. This physiological ability increases with increasing stem diameter, as re-sprouting requires sufficient nutrient reserves. Are survival and growth of seedlings and saplings of woody savanna species related to habitat conditions and land-cover type?
   Location Semi-arid savannas representing different site conditions and land-use practices in North Benin, West Africa.
   Methods For individuals of 18 common woody species <1-m tall, basal diameter and height were repeatedly measured in five censuses from 2008 to 2010 in the land-cover types non-arable sites, fallows and protected areas. We used multistate capturerecapture models to estimate survival and transition probabilities between diameter classes.
   Results We detected six groups of species with similar survival and transition probabilities. For one of these groups we found no correlation to land use, whereas the other groups comprise species with distinct preferences for different land-cover types. Most species developed better in the communal area compared to the protected area. For five species (one shrub and four trees), we detected an extremely low transition probability for the latter land-cover type.
   Conclusion For some species groups, differences in plant performance were explained by a human-caused opening of the canopy that is beneficial for germination of seeds and enhances survival of juveniles by reducing the competition for light, water and nutrients. Other species showed their best demographic performance in the communal area on non-arable sites with unfavourable environmental conditions and resulting small-scale heterogeneity (mosaic of bare ground and areas with low herbaceous cover), whereas five species are likely to decline in the protected area.

AB Petrolisthes elongatus (Milne-Edwards, 1837) was first introduced into southern Tasmania in the late 19th century putatively associated with live-oyster transfers from New Zealand. In the last century P. elongatus populations have expanded, inoculating rocky intertidal zones around Tasmania. We initially identified the scope of P. elongatus introduced range around Tasmania by visiting 57 sites to identify presence. Density of P. elongatus and populations of two native grapsid crab species was assessed at 12 sites around Tasmania to identify any biotic resistance. Abiotic factors including substrate availability and preference, and wave stress, were identified at each of the 57 sites. Our results indicate that P. elongatus has successfully invaded a large proportion of the southern and northern coasts of Tasmania, with a small number of sites on the east and none on the west coast supporting P. elongatus populations. Densities were found to be higher in southern Tasmania compared to the eastern and northern coastlines. Petrolisthes elongatus presence was found to be positively correlated with native grapsid crab presence, however, no statistically significant relationship was found between densities at scales of site or quadrat. Abiotic factors have been identified as the primary drivers of Petrolisthes distribution patterns.

AB 1. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are ubiquitous compounds in aquatic organisms that are usually considered sunscreens that protect them from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Given that virtually all animals lack the metabolic pathways to synthesise MAAs de novo, they must acquire them either from their diet or from microorganisms living in close association. In freshwater copepods, accumulation of MAAs is stimulated by exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible radiation.
   2. A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was performed to assess the contributions of dietary and microbial sources of MAAs in the freshwater copepod Boeckella antiqua. The treatments consisted of two different diets: an MAA-free diet, including only Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and an MAA-rich diet, including both C. reinhardtii and Peridinium inconspicuum, crossed with two antibiotic treatments, with and without chloramphenicol. Treatment with chloramphenicol was intended to inhibit the development of bacteria associated with the copepods.
   3. MAA concentration in B. antiqua was affected by the experimental conditions: (i) exposure to artificial PAR + UVR stimulated the accumulation of several MAAs (up to 62% increase in total MAA concentration with respect to the initial concentration); (ii) the presence of chloramphenicol in the culture media reduced the MAA concentration in copepods fed an MAA-free diet; (iii) in the absence of chloramphenicol, copepods fed the MAA-rich diet had significantly higher total MAA concentration than those fed the MAA-deficient diet; but (iv) dietary supplementation with an MAA-rich algae in the presence of chloramphenicol failed to significantly increase total MAA concentration.
   4. Analysis of profiles from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that the prokaryotic community associated with the copepods was affected by chloramphenicol. Dendograms constructed from digitalised DGGE images consistently grouped the antibiotics treatments separately from the initial samples and the treatments without antibiotics. Two band positions were exclusive to treatments without antibiotics.
   5. We conclude that when offered an MAA-rich diet, B. antiqua may accumulate a proportion of MAAs from diet. However, we suspect that in the absence of an MAA-rich dietary source (as in its natural habitat), virtually all MAAs present in B. antiqua are produced by copepod-associated prokaryotes.

AB We describe the first records of spirochetes in the gut of fourteen species of continental gastropods from a range of habitats and representing six families (Amnicolidae, Baicaliidae, Bithyniidae, Pyrgulidae, Lithoglyphidae and Benedictiidae). The bacteria were mainly found in the crystalline style sac, as has been reported in marine bivalves. The surveyed habitats include water bodies in North America and Eurasia, including deep water hydrothermal vent and gas hydrate zones in Lake Baikal. Spirochetes were present both in mature and young snails, but were not detected in embryos before hatching, indicating lateral transfer. The surveyed gastropods range in trophic strategy, including phyto-, detrito- and bacteriophagous grazers and filter feeders. Our results indicate that spirochetes are commensal in the surveyed gastropods with potential limited benefit and no detriment to the host animal. We suggest that the specialized internal habitat of the crystalline style sac in molluscs is likely to reveal unrecognized spirochete diversity that will shed new light on gastropod trophic ecology and spirochete diversity.

However, aerial surveys may still suffer from underestimation because of undetected animals and low precision as a result of inefficient sampling designs.
   Aims. We assess detection of two species of deer in prairie-parkland communities of western Canada and evaluate a suite of survey design features for improving the accuracy and precision of population estimates from aerial surveys.
   Methods. Modelling detection of deer was based on 100 sightability trials involving 54 radio-collared white-tailed and 46 mule deer. We used empirical survey data to simulate surveys under three alternative stratification approaches, schemes for grouping strata, and allocations of survey effort and compared the precision and accuracy of the resulting population estimates.
   Key results. We observed deer in 83 of the 100 trials, with detection decreasing with small group size, reduced deer activity, low snow cover, high forest cover and observer fatigue. Survey precision and accuracy were highest when stratification was based on natural breaks, calculated via Jenks optimisation, in the values of resource-selection function (RSF), although improvement was less pronounced for estimates of mule deer abundance. Optimal or equal allocation of sampling effort among strata outperformed proportional allocation of sampling effort. Use of RSF for stratification reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) in estimates of deer numbers from 38% to 23% for white-tailed deer and from 33% to 27% for mule deer compared with past approaches.
   Conclusions. Stratification based on RSF values improved precision of deer surveys the most; however, using even simple measures related to habitat selection can improve population estimates. Where deer are highly aggregated, reliably recording all variables needed to implement sightability models can prove problematic; however, survey detection adjustments are nevertheless important to account for the relatively small, but still significant, proportion of missed animals in open prairie-parkland environments.
   Implications. Field experiments to assess aerial survey design are impractical because of cost. We illustrate how simulated surveys using empirical data can be useful to evaluate alternative survey designs to improve population estimates in a region when high accuracy or precision are needed to address management questions or to calibrate more cost-effective approaches.

AB Ant-lions are pit-building larvae (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), which possess relatively large mandibles used for catching and consuming prey. Few studies involving terrestrial arthropod larva have investigated prey capture behavior and kinematics and no study has shown modulation of strike kinematics. We examined feeding kinematics of the ant-lion, Myrmeleon crudelis, using high-speed video to investigate whether larvae modulate strike behavior based on prey location relative to the mandible. Based on seven capture events from five M. crudelis, the strike took 17.60 +/- 2.92 msec and was characterized by near-simultaneous contact of both mandibles with the prey. Modulation of the angular velocity of the mandibles based on prey location was clearly demonstrated. M. crudelis larvae attempted to simultaneously contact prey with both mandibles by increasing mean angular velocity of the far mandible (65 +/- 21 rad sec(-1)) compared with the near mandible (35 +/- 14 rad sec(-1)). Furthermore, kinematic results showed a significant difference for mean angular velocity between the two mandibles (P<0.005). Given the lengthy strike duration compared with other fast-striking arthropods, these data suggest that there is a tradeoff between the ability to modulate strike behavior for accurate simultaneous mandible contact and the overall velocity of the strike. The ability to modulate prey capture behavior may increase dietary breadth and capture success rate in these predatory larvae by allowing responsive adjustment to small-scale variations in prey size, presentation, and escape response.

AB Present status of the endangered limpet Cymbula nigra (Gastropoda, Pate Wee) in Ceuta: how do substrate heterogeneity and area accessibility affect population structure? Cymbula nigra (Gastropoda, Patellidae) is a threatened giant patellid limpet found on the North African coast from Namibia to Algeria. The objective of this study was to estimate the total number of individuals present in Ceuta (Strait of Gibraltar) and to determine the effect of certain physical parameters on population structure and abundance. Between 2006 and 2010 we conducted an exhaustive census in the area. Results indicate that Ceuta could be home to 48,473 individuals. The most important populations were recorded on the North Bay, characterized by its Atlantic influence. While for other similar species, such as Patella ferruginea, human accessibility to the area plays an important role in determining the structure of populations, we found that substrate roughness (small scale topographic heterogeneity) is the main determining factor in this species. Populations located on medium to low topographic heterogeneity substrates showed higher percentages of medium and large size individuals. However, recruitment rates did not differ between substrata of different roughness. Finally, and through the analysis of the C. nigra populations located on some recently constructed jetties, we obtained interesting new data regarding individual growth rates, thus contributing to our knowledge of the population structure of the species.

AB Yellow sweetclover is an exotic herbaceous legume common in the Great Plains of the US. Although woody legumes have been shown to affect ecosystem processes through nitrogen (N) fixation (i.e., they can be considered "transformers" sensu Richardson et al. (2000)), the same has not been shown for short-lived herbaceous species. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the effects of yellow sweetclover on N mineralization and nitrification and (2) assess the effects of N fertilization on two plant communities, badlands sparse vegetation and western wheatgrass prairie. We used in situ (in wheatgrass prairie) and laboratory incubations (for both plant communities) to assess N dynamics at sites with high and low sweetclover cover in the two plant communities. We found that both N mineralization and nitrification were higher in the high sweetclover plots in the sparse plant community, but not in the wheatgrass prairie. To assess fertilization effects and determine if nutrients or water were limiting at our sites, we conducted a field experiment with five resource addition treatments, (1) N, (2) N + water, (3) water, (4) phosphorus, and (5) no addition. Water was limiting in the wheatgrass prairie but contrary to expectation, N was not. In contrast, N was limiting in the sparse community, where a fertilization effect was seen in exotic forbs, especially the toxic invader Halogeton glomeratus. Our results emphasize the contingent nature of plant invasion in which effects are largely dependent on attributes of the recipient vegetation.

AB We investigated the effects of human disturbance and attitudes on the density of the tree agama Acanthocercus atricollis atricollis in a densely populated rural settlement in South Africa. In this environment agamas live on trees that are harvested for firewood or maintained for fruit production. We conducted visual encounter surveys of A. a. atricollis and interviewed local households to establish whether human attitudes and actions could affect tree agama populations. Although local residents viewed tree agamas negatively (50% of interviewees claimed to have killed an agama) and acted to exclude them from their environment, tree agama density in villages was higher than that of adjacent communal rangelands and than a previously reported density estimate in a nearby protected area. We suggest three major factors that could explain why tree agamas are favoured in this peri-urban landscape in the face of human persecution: firstly, predators such as snakes and raptors are likely to occur at a much lower density in peri-urban areas; secondly, their primary prey (insects) may be more abundant or accessible in this landscape; thirdly, they may experience less competition for resources.

AB A suite of factors including prey availability and prey defenses influence prey selection by consumers and ultimately define an animal's feeding strategy (e.g., generalist or specialist). Here we examined the relationship between availability and selection of ants by the desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos Girard, 1852) to test the hypothesis that P. platyrhinos are specialist predators on harvester ants, and to investigate which factors influence the prey preference of lizards. Variation in ant availability and lizard diets was assessed using 83 plots established along a Great Basin shrub-steppe bajada in northwestern Utah, USA. Across the study site, 14 of 20 ant species were represented in the lizard diet. However, 70% of that diet consisted of just two species. In contrast to previous studies, P. platyrhinos did not show a disproportionate preference for harvester ants. Instead, larger ants of any species (including harvester ants) were preferentially selected over medium-sized and smaller ants. These findings suggest that desert horned lizards demonstrate an opportunistic feeding strategy in which lizards select ants based on their body size and abundance. More generally, these results emphasize the importance of assessing predator response across naturally varying gradients in prey availability to evaluate feeding specialization.

AB Natural hybrids among the specialized terrestrial oil-secreting orchids of South Africa are extremely rare even where multiple closely related species co-occur. We found putative hybrids between Pterygodium catholicum Sw. and P. acutifolium Lindl., two closely related oil-secreting orchids that lack morphological barriers to inter-breeding. The purpose of this study was to confirm the parentage of the putative hybrids using molecular data from one nuclear (ITS) and two plastid (matK-trnK and trnL/F introns) DNA regions. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences as well as nucleotide substitution patterns of the putative hybrids, putative parents, and their closest relatives were consistent with a hypothesis of hybridization. We suggest that the hybrids were the result of visits to both orchids by a single species of oil-collecting bee during a brief period of flowering overlap. These results suggest that the rarity of hybrids between these orchids is due to factors other than genetic incompatibility.

Dried leaves from both species were milled to prepare leaf extracts of 0, 5, 20, 40, 60 and 100 g/l concentrations. The leaf extracts of P. juliflora and Z. spina-christi were used to irrigate seedlings of each other. Zizyphus spina-christi leaf extract decreased the root parameters (total root length, root surface area, number of tips and root Volume) of P. juliflora and the decrease was concentration dependent. However, leaf extract of P. juliflora Stimulated the parameters of Z. spina-christi roots, The root length, root surface area and number of tips increased with increasing concentration, except at 100 g/l concentration. The study revealed that Z spina-christi leaf extract was inhibitory to the growth of another plant species, it was reported first time.

AB The Region of Bio-Bio is located on the southern edge of central Chile, considered a hotspot of biodiversity. Although the region is strongly disturbed by human activities, mainly agriculture, forestry, industrialization and urbanization, it has a low percentage of area covered by the National System of Protected Areas (SNASPE). Thus, to document the regional biodiversity is a critical task. The diversity of the family Poaceae (Gramineae) in the Region of Bio-Bio, Chile, was studied on the basis of data obtained from the databases of the herbaria of the University of Concepcion (CONC) and the National Museum of Natural History (SGO), as well as from the taxonomic literature. Maps showing the collecting intensity and species richness were made. To assess the completeness of the inventory a rarefaction curve was constructed and the estimated species richness was calculated by the non-parametric indices Chao2 and ICE. The grass flora of the Region of Bio-Bio, identified from 3,069 specimens, consists of 234 species and 11 infraspecific taxa, distributed in 76 genera and 8 subfamilies. A total of 66.2% of the species are native (155 species), including 11.5% (27 species) endemic from Chile and 54.7% (128 species) native from Chile but not endemic; 33.7% (79 species) are introduced. The subfamilies better represented in number of species are Pooideae (73.08%), Panicoideae (12.39%), Danthonioideae (5.98%) and Chloridoideae (4.70%). The values of estimated richness suggest that the inventory of Poaceae has been completed in 83-85%, which means that about 40 species could still be recognized in the Region of Bio-Bio.

AB Invasion of the exotic Acacia longifolia in Portugal has serious ecosystem level impacts. In this paper we test the hypothesis that the invasion of A. longifolia into seasonally water limited southern Portugal significantly affects the ecosystem water balance by decreasing the water available for native species. From October 2007 through July 2008 we monitored sap flow using Granier-type sensors in three groups of trees in a secondary dunes pine forest in southern Portugal: (1) overstory Pinus pinaster trees with an A. longifolia invaded understory, (2) P. pinaster trees without an A. longifolia understory and (3) the understory A. longifolia trees. Averaged over the entire study, stand water use on a ground area basis, E-T, was reduced by 26% in the invaded as compared to non-invaded P. pinaster trees. Furthermore, A. longifolia water use contributed 31% on average and up to 43% of total E-T in the invaded area. Total E-T was 6.5% greater in the invaded than non-invaded area. A detailed examination of daily sapwood-related sap flux density, Q(S), during a rain pulse, dry-down event in the fall of 2007 provided further evidence that differences in sap flux density between the non-invaded and invaded P. pinaster populations were directly affected by A. longifolia water use. Hence, the invasion of A. longifolia significantly impacts the water cycle in a pine forest in southern Portugal.

AB The spread of game ranching in southern Africa provides opportunities for the reestablishment of populations of endangered wild dogs extirpated by livestock ranchers. However, this potential has not been realized, partly because of negative rancher perceptions. Some ranchers believe that wild dogs impart costs by killing wildlife that could be utilized consumptively. Others complain that wild dogs make ungulates 'skittish' and cause local reductions in prey densities while denning. We compared the skittishness and density of prey species inside and outside the denning home ranges of nine wild dog packs in Zimbabwe. Wild dogs had no impact on prey skittishness, but prey species did occur at lower densities inside denning home ranges. In some scenarios, and particularly on fenced game ranches, wild dogs could cause prey population declines during denning. On small game ranches, the use of fences as a tool by wild dogs during hunting can increase the proportion of large prey species in their diet by up to 11 times, and thus increase the minimum area required to support that diet. In addition, game fencing is typically permeable to wild dogs but not their prey, preventing the recovery of prey populations through the natural influx of prey animals into the denning area following departure of the dogs. Wild dogs could thus impose significant financial costs to game ranchers hosting denning packs. Our findings emphasize the importance of promoting the formation of conservancies, where neighbouring landowners remove boundary fences to create larger contiguous wildlife areas.

AB Land to be remediated, such as those affected by heavy metals or organic pollutants, can be remediated using biological approaches. These include, quarries and strip mines, or land impacted by oil pollution or other organic pollutants. Phytoremediation is usually a key component of bioremediation. However, without restoring soil organic matter, the soil biodiversity takes decades to recover. The soil organisms are a key component of soil function, and support plant growth. In addition, the soil microbiology is essential both for bioremediation and supporting phytoremediation. Using inexpensive sources of quality organic matter, it should be possible to accelerate recovery of ecosystem health and biodiversity. One potential source of untapped organic matter is municipal solid waste as a composted amendment. The organic matter amendment promotes soil structure and the creation of adequate habitat and substrate for the soil decomposition food web. Long-term chronosequence studies indicate that soil food webs tend to make a transition after about 20 years to a stable community structure. This approach could be used to gain carbon credits by restoring degraded or polluted soils.

AB The project entitled "Study of montane ecosystems in the Malagasy region" (RCP 225/CNRS, directed by Renaud Paulian) aimed to elucidate the general features of these ecosystems and the origin of their constituent elements, and to test the validity of the High Mountain Domain proposed by Humbert in 1951. From 1970 to 1973, three expeditions (to the Andringitra, Anosy, Ankaratra, itremo, libity and Marojejy massifs) provided informations to characterize the ecology of these particular environments and to analyse systematically certain groups well-known for their biogeographic interest. The altitudinal succession of plant formations, defined by physiognomic and structural criteria, were detailed for each massif. The highest belt, characterized by an ericoid bush and related associations, does not correspond to the High Mountain formation of East Africa. Data on several faunal groups, including invertebrates (Hexapoda: Collembola and Dermaptera), indicate a disjunction between the northern montane massifs (Tsaratanana and marojejy) and the remainder in the Center and South; several floristic groups (Pandanaceae, Araliaceae and Asteraceae) are currently being analyzed in a similar manner. Madagascar's High Mountain Domain is an ecological reality, but it can not be defined floristically, as each massif represents a separate phyrogeographic entity of the island's Central Domain. Faunal groups with limited mobility broadly indicate a trophic and bioclimatic dependence (buffer effect of the intra-forest climate) with regard to vegetation belt, but can respond to local microclimates by a shift at the limits of their ranges.

AB There has been considerable debate about how best to define sustainable development. In this commentary, I argue that Amartya Sen's concept of 'development as freedom' is the appropriate theoretical framework for understanding sustainable development. Environmentalists should consider defining their goal as 'sustainable development as freedom,' the achievement of the greatest possible level of freedom without restricting the access of future generations to these same freedoms. The adoption of this framework has implications for the work of environmental NGOs, which are briefly discussed.

   2. Two species, Daphnia lumholtzi and Daphnia parvula, occurred and reproduced in turbid locations, but two other species, Daphnia mendotae and Daphnia pulicaria, occurred almost exclusively in relatively clear conditions.
   3. To test the hypothesis that interference with foraging excludes clear-water Daphnia species from turbid locations, we incubated adult D. mendotae at both a clear and a turbid site. In three successive experiments D. mendotae individuals incubated at the turbid site carried as many or more eggs than individuals incubated at the clear site.

AB Tropical deforestation can cause fundamental regional-scale shifts in vegetation structure and diversity. This is particularly true in Africa. Although national parks are being established to protect areas from deforestation and to conserve biodiversity, these parks are not immune to disturbances outside their boundaries. We used regional-scale atmospheric simulation experiments to investigate how deforestation in timber concessions might affect precipitation inside adjacent, undisturbed national parks in the equatorial African countries of Gabon and the Republic of Congo. The experiments revealed a complex response. Some parks showed rainfall reduced as much as 15%, while others showed slight increases. Rainfall inside parks was particularly sensitive to upwind deforestation along the path of airborne moisture traveling inland from the ocean. A variety of shortcomings in the current modeling procedures limit the ability to extrapolate from experiments such as ours to provide spatially explicit, long-term forecasts of climate. We describe what advances in modeling are needed to produce regional-scale predictions that are robust enough to be useful to managers and policy makers.

AB The pattern of cyst distribution in the absence of turbation and their hatching behaviour were studied in an outdoor artificial pool, where just differentiated adults of the anostracan Chirocephalus ruffoi (sex ratio 1: 3) lived until it dried up. The horizontal and vertical distributions of cysts in the pool bed were determined. The comparison between cyst bank estimate (MURA, 2004) and the actual number of cysts counted in the pool bed revealed an estimate error of 20.9%. Resting eggs occurred only in the upper 2.5 cm thick soil sections and decreased within this section as depth increased. Peripheral areas of the pool contained significantly larger numbers of cysts than the central area. Multiway analysis on the results recorded in hatching success (nested ANOVA) revealed that the differences were significantly affected by initial soil conditions, treatment and vertical distribution of cysts. Among these factors, vertical distribution (sections nested in cores) was the most influential. Hatching success was significantly inversely related to depth. Differences in the timing of hatching depending on the above considered factors were also noted. A nearly synchronous hatching pattern was observed only for cysts from initially dry sediment of the uppermost layers. In all successively deeper layers, hatching showed multiple peaks and was increasingly delayed and erratic (already mentioned). ANCOVA within each of the experimental conditions revealed significant differences in hatching frequencies (time as covariate) depending on sediment depth. Within any given layer, ANCOVA revealed a significant influence of initial sediment conditions and treatment on the timing of hatching.

AB In Japan, government and ecological scientists recommend that indigenous species should be used in planting to maintain biodiversity. Using forest topsoil is an efficient planting strategy for indigenous species. We wanted to find the best time of year for collecting forest topsoil. We regularly collected topsoil throughout 1 year from a deciduous forest in suburban Tokyo. The soil seed bank composition was estimated by recording seedling emergences. Additionally, the seed rain, influence of predation to dispersed seeds. and seedling emergence at the forest floor were also estimated. The soil seed bank composition did not change greatly during the year studied; however, the buried seeds were abundant comparatively in January and April. Therefore, it was suggested whenever possible to collect forest topsoil as planting material. Additionally, we suggested that the best time to collect topsoil was from November to February. This was also supported by the results of seed rain and seedling emergences at the forest floor added to the result of the seed bank. A method of measuring the value of soil seed bank as a planting material was evaluated. An evaluation based on seed density of pioneer tree species was suitable for even small amounts of topsoil.

AB Eco-floristic classification (Brawn-Blanquet system) is useful since in similar manner it can establish ecological units of different level (syntaxons) that have high indicative value. Syntaxons can be used as markers of terrestrial ecosystems of different range. Although this system was proposed by analogy with plant taxonomy it reflects vegetation continuum. The application of this approach is based on certain standards and supported by developed software. The elements of arbitrariness in Brawn-Blanquet method are constrained by rules of strict recommendations. The method is considered as necessary in studies of biodiversity in protected areas.

AB Egg (cyst) banks play a fundamental role in the survival strategy of the hydrobionts of temporary pools. Therefore a quantitative estimate, as accurate as possible, of their size is the starting point for all the possible considerations concerning the life history of the inhabiting populations. We describe here, in some details, a sampling procedure to evaluate the number of cysts laid by the anostracan Chirocephalus ruffoi Cottarelli & Mura, 1984, in an experimental pool and we show that this procedure results in a good estimate of the cyst bank consistency. A pool 150 cm in diameter was divided into five concentrical rings, 13 cm apart from each other, and a central core (with a 10 cm radius). The number of samples needed to obtain an accurate estimate was calculated by taking into account that, to perform uniform sampling, the total volume of the samples must be proportional to the volume of the pool bed in each ring. The number of cysts in each of the rings was then estimated by considering the mean of the experimental results of a previous study (61 core samples along six transects across the pool itself), multiplied by the number of samples ideally performed in each sector. Evaluating the cyst bank size by the above method resulted in an estimate with an error of only 4% compared to the real cyst bank size. We also show that the number of samples needed can significantly be reduced, with an error on the total number of cysts that can be controlled. This result, that follows from statistical considerations on the confidence interval for the mean, allows us to obtain a general sampling procedure that can be applied to statistically comparable pools.

AB Gases in the marine boundary layer in Fildes Peninsula, maritime Antarctica were sampled and analyzed for the first time. Sampling sites included areas covered by moss and lichen growth, penguin colonies and an area where scientific research stations are located. A total of 211 samples were analyzed for N2O concentrations, with an average of (321.33+/-3.07) nL/L. This is above the global average value of 314 nL/L. it is found that the N2O concentrations evidently increase during the summer months. Concentrations around the research stations are higher than at remote areas, indicating a potential source from human activities on the island, N2O concentrations at a large penguin colony on Barton Peninsula are the highest among the sampled areas. This may explain why N2O concentrations in Fildes Peninsula are higher than the global average. Our preliminary conclusions are that human activities and emissions from penguin dropping-amended soil and vegetation soil constitute the major sources of N2O in the maritime Antarctic atmosphere.

   mapping and monitoring
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE vegetation scheme; mapping; monitoring; land cover
AB Understanding of global ecological problems is at least partly dependent on clear assessments of vegetation change, and such assessment is always dependent on the use of a Vegetation classification scheme. Use of satellite remotely sensed data is the only practical means of carrying out any global-scale vegetation mapping exercise, but if the resulting maps are to be useful to most ecologists and conservationists, they must be closely tied to clearly defined features of vegetation on the ground. Furthermore, much of the mapping that does take place involves more local-scale description of field sites; for purposes of cost and practicality, such studies usually do not involve remote sensing using satellites. There is a need for a single scheme that integrates the smallest to the largest scale in a way that is meaningful to most environmental scientists.
   Existing schemes are unsatisfactory for this task; they are ambiguous, unnecessarily complex, and their categories do not correspond to common-sense definitions. In response to these problems, a simple structural-physiognomically based scheme with 23 fundamental categories is proposed here for mapping and monitoring on any scale, from local to global. The fundamental categories each subdivide into more specific structural categories for more detailed mapping, but all the categories can be used throughout the world and at any scale, allowing intercomparison between regions.
   The next stage in the process will be to obtain the views of as many people working in as many different fields as possible, to see whether the proposed scheme suits their needs and how it should be modified. With a few modifications, such a scheme could easily be appended to an existing land cover classification scheme, such as the FAO system, greatly increasing the usefulness and accessability of the results of the landcover classification.

AB The characteristics of the microbiota of a formulated abalone (Haliotis laevigata) diet were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and standard bacterial culture and taxonomic techniques. Microbes colonizing the diet (ABCHOW) were enumerated by SEM and partly identified after immersion of the diet in seawater for 0, 2, and 4 days with and without abalone. The fatty acid composition of the dirt was also analyzed, after similar treatments, for biomass estimates and bacterial biomarker identification. Bacterial numbers on unimmersed diet and diet immersed in sterile seawater for 2 and 4 days were negligible. Bacteria proliferated after 2 days immersion in seawater with abalone (1.2 x 10(5) cells/mm(2)) and without abalone (5.7 x 10(4) cells/mm(2)) (P < .05). Numbers continued to rise between 2 and 4 days for diet immersed without abalone (6.5 x 10(4) cells/mm(2)). However, a decrease in bacterial numbers was observed between 2 and 4 days immersion in seawater with abalone (7.7 x 10(4) cells/mm(2) after 4 days), and this was accompanied by an increase in ciliate numbers (from 0 to 10(2) ciliates/mm(2)). Ten distinct taxonomic groups of bacteria were identified from the diet after immersion; Cytophaga SPP was the most abundant group. Chemotaxonomic analysis, including fatty acid profiling, failed to provide microbial biomass estimates or bacterial biomarkers. The majority of the microbes were found to have the capacity to degrade a protein and a lipid sourer within the diet, but not two carbohydrate sources, including the binder. Bacteria were found to affect the physical form of the diet, but it is unlikely that they affected its macronutritional value to any great extent.

AB The leopard occurs widely in the world. Consequently it has great adaptability and a wide range of ecological characteristics. Some of these characteristics are valid throughout its range, but others are specific to a given region. This paper describes the ecology of the leopards of the arid southern Kalahari where extremes in environmental conditions often exist. In marking behaviour and reproduction the general species pattern is followed. However, cub mortality is high. The ranges used by leopards in the southern Kalahari are much larger than elsewhere. They probably reflect the prey-poor nature of the area. Feeding is opportunistic and southern Kalahari leopards are number maximisers when hunting. A flexible prey approach is used when hunting some prey. The leopard is independent of free water. Exploitation competition is probably slight, but these leopards do compete with lions and spotted hyaenas for food.

AB Interspecific spatial overlap profiles are constructed for several pairs of iguanid lizard species. The profiles depict the proportion of activity points within the territories and home ranges of target lizards that are shared with individuals of other lizard species. Results show that within populations some individuals may incur little or no spatial overlap from other lizard species, whereas others have high spatial overlap. These patterns of overlap may be sustained through entire seasons of lizard activity. Profile shapes included distributions that were unimodal and strongly skewed, bimodal, and uniform with roughly equivalent proportions of low, intermediate, and high overlaps. Spatial overlap profiles are idiosyncratic, neither characterizing a particular pair of lizard species, nor typifying a specific habitat type. The observations provide insight into the results of experimental studies that show weak or undetectable effects of competition at the population level, but may include asymmetric effects targeted at specific individuals. In addition, because spatial overlap profiles for a pair of species are variable, interactions cannot be characterized by the results of an experimental manipulation conducted in just one habitat.

AB Global patterns of regional (gamma) plant diversity are relatively well known, but whether these patterns hold for local communities, and the dependence on spatial grain, remain controversial. Using data on 170,272 georeferenced local plant assemblages, we created global maps of alpha diversity (local species richness) for vascular plants at three different spatial grains, for forests and non-forests. We show that alpha diversity is consistently high across grains in some regions (for example, Andean-Amazonian foothills), but regional 'scaling anomalies' (deviations from the positive correlation) exist elsewhere, particularly in Eurasian temperate forests with disproportionally higher fine-grained richness and many African tropical forests with disproportionally higher coarse-grained richness. The influence of different climatic, topographic and biogeographical variables on alpha diversity also varies across grains. Our multi-grain maps return a nuanced understanding of vascular plant biodiversity patterns that complements classic maps of biodiversity hotspots and will improve predictions of global change effects on biodiversity.
   Global patterns of regional plant diversity are relatively well known, but whether they hold for local communities is debated. This study created multi-grain global maps of alpha diversity for vascular plants to provide a nuanced understanding of plant diversity hotspots and improve predictions of global change effects on biodiversity.

AB Watershed resilience is the ability of a watershed to maintain its characteristic system state while concurrently resisting, adapting to, and reorganizing after hydrological (for example, drought, flooding) or biogeochemical (for example, excessive nutrient) disturbances. Vulnerable waters include non-floodplain wetlands and headwater streams, abundant watershed components representing the most distal extent of the freshwater aquatic network. Vulnerable waters are hydrologically dynamic and biogeochemically reactive aquatic systems, storing, processing, and releasing water and entrained (that is, dissolved and particulate) materials along expanding and contracting aquatic networks. The hydrological and biogeochemical functions emerging from these processes affect the magnitude, frequency, timing, duration, storage, and rate of change of material and energy fluxes among watershed components and to downstream waters, thereby maintaining watershed states and imparting watershed resilience. We present here a conceptual framework for understanding how vulnerable waters confer watershed resilience. We demonstrate how individual and cumulative vulnerable-water modifications (for example, reduced extent, altered connectivity) affect watershed-scale hydrological and biogeochemical disturbance response and recovery, which decreases watershed resilience and can trigger transitions across thresholds to alternative watershed states (for example, states conducive to increased flood frequency or nutrient concentrations). We subsequently describe how resilient watersheds require spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in hydrological and biogeochemical interactions between terrestrial systems and down-gradient waters, which necessitates attention to the conservation and restoration of vulnerable waters and their downstream connectivity gradients. To conclude, we provide actionable principles for resilient watersheds and articulate research needs to further watershed resilience science and vulnerable-water management.

AB The flora of China is well known for its high diversity and endemism. Identifying centers of endemism and designating conservation priorities are essential goals for biodiversity studies. However, there is no comprehensive study from a rigorous phylogenetic perspective to understand patterns of diversity and endemism and to guide biodiversity conservation in China. We conducted a spatial phylogenetic analysis of the Chinese angiosperm flora at the generic level to identify centers of neo- and paleo-endemism. Our results indicate that: (i) the majority of grid cells in China with significantly high phylogenetic endemism (PE) were located in the mountainous regions; (ii) four of the nine centers of endemism recognized, located in northern and western China, were recognized for the first time; (iii) arid and semiarid regions in Northwest China were commonly linked to significant PE, consistent with other spatial phylogenetic studies worldwide; and (iv) six high-priority conservation gaps were detected by overlaying the boundaries of China's nature reserves on all significant PE cells. Overall, we conclude that the mountains of southern and northern China contain both paleo-endemics (ancient relictual lineages) and neo-endemics (recently diverged lineages). The areas we highlight as conservation priorities are important for broad-scale planning, especially in the context of evolutionary history preservation.

AB Fagaceae includes typical masting species that exhibit highly synchronized and fluctuating acorn production. Fagaceae shows an interesting feature in that fertilization is delayed by several weeks to more than 1 year after pollination. Although delayed fertilization was recorded over a century ago, the evolutionary advantage of delayed fertilization is still poorly understood. Here, we present a new hypothesis that delayed fertilization facilitates temporal niche differentiation via non-overlapping flowering times among species. Comparing flowering and fruiting times in 228 species from five genera in Fagaceae, we first show that there is a close association between a wider spread of flowering times and the likelihood of a 2-year fruiting habit in which there is a long delay from pollination to fertilization. To study the coevolution of flowering time and delayed fertilization, we developed a mathematical model that incorporates the effects of competition for pollinators, seed predator satiation and unfavourable season for reproduction on fitness. The model shows that delayed fertilization facilitates the diversification of flowering time in a population, which is advantageous for animal-pollinated trees that compete over pollinators. Our new hypothesis about the coevolution of delayed fertilization and flowering time will provide new insight into the evolution of masting. This article is part of the theme issue 'The ecology and evolution of synchronized seed production in plants'.

AB Despite genuine attempts, the history of marine and coastal ecosystem management is littered with examples of poor environmental, social and financial outcomes. Marine ecosystems are largely populated by species with open populations, and feature ecological processes that are driven by multiple, interwoven, dynamic causes and effects. This complexity limits the acquisition of relevant knowledge of habitat characteristics, species utilisation and ecosystem dynamics. The consequence of this lack of knowledge is uncertainty about the link between action taken and outcome achieved. Such uncertainty risks misdirected human and financial investment, and sometimes may even lead to perverse outcomes. Technological advances offer new data acquisition opportunities, but the diversity and complexity of the biological and ecological information needed to reduce uncertainty means the increase in knowledge will be slow unless it is undertaken in a structured and focussed way. We introduce "Ecological Constraint Mapping" - an approach that takes a "supply chain" point of view and focusses on identifying the principal factors that constrain life-history outcomes (success/productivity/resilience/fitness) for marine and coastal species, and ultimately the quality and resilience of the ecosystems they are components of, and the life-history supporting processes and values ecosystems provide. By providing a framework for the efficient development of actionable knowledge, Ecological Constraint Mapping can facilitate a move from paradigm-based to knowledge-informed decision-making on ecological issues. It is suitable for developing optimal solutions to a wide range of conservation and management problems, providing an organised framework that aligns with current perspectives on the complex nature of marine and coastal systems.

AB We synthesize published botanical information for the flora of Africa to address multiple questions, including the following: How many species of vascular plants are there in Africa? How are the species distributed among different phylogenetic clades or taxonomic groups of vascular plants and different geographic regions across Africa? How complete are species lists derived from open-access online sources at various spatial scales? And at what spatial scales might species lists derived from open-access online sources be used to address macroecological and biogeographic questions for the flora of Africa? We used eight open-access online botanical databases and 188 regional, national, and local floras and checklists of vascular plants to generate species lists for sampling areas at various spatial scales examined in this study. Africa harbours at least 65,414 native species of vascular plants. Using the online botanical databases examined in this study to generate country-level or larger species lists, the completeness of the resulting species lists will be typically >90%. The completeness of species lists derived from geo-referenced occurrence records available online was 36.6, 53.1 and 72.1%, respectively, at the spatial scales of 100 km x 100 km, 200 km x 200 km, and 300 km x 300 km.

AB Desertification is one of the most alarming forms of land degradation that threatens the functioning of dryland ecosystems. Ecological restoration of ecosystem functioning in sandy land has become a worldwide urgent research issue. In this study, the effects of plant litter crust (plant litter from poplar leaves of the surrounding area and sand grains bonded together due to interaction of water erosion and wind erosion) on surface soil properties and the loamification process of sandy soil were assessed in a semi-arid sandy land ecosystem at the edge of Mu Us sandy land by the field experiment sampling and indoor analysis. Soil structure and nutrient content were measured at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) of bare sandy soils (as control), the soils beneath of the biological soil crust and the three stages of plant litter crusts (1-, 3- and 5-years old). We found that plant litter crust cover significantly improved soil structure and soil moisture through increasing soil macro-aggregates, clay and silt sized grains content, and total soil porosity, and decreasing soil temperature. Significant differences were observed in the content of total nitrogen and available soil phosphorous and potassium among the different types of crust and bare sandy soil. In the 0-5 cm soil depth, the available phosphorous of 3- and 5-years litter curst were 71% and 94% higher than that of bare sandy soil, respectively. These results suggest that plant litter crust functioned as a driving force to promote the loamification process through modifying sandy soil surface properties. This study proves the critical role played by the plant litter crust in the ecological restoration of semi-arid sandy land ecosystem. Besides, the hypothesis that plant litter crusts have great potential in combating desertification is correct and should be considered as an appropriate measure for ecological restoration in sandy areas.

TI Bistability in a tri-trophic food chain model: Basin stability
   perspective
SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID CHAOTIC ATTRACTORS; PREDATOR-PREY; SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS
AB The most important issue of concern in a food chain is the stability of species and their nature of persistence against system parameter changes. For understanding the stable dynamics and their response against parameter perturbation, the local stability analysis is an insufficient tool. A global stability analysis by the conventional techniques seems to supplement some of the shortcomings, however, it becomes more challenging for multistable ecosystems. Either of the techniques fails to provide a complete description of the complexity in dynamics that may evolve in the system, especially, when there is any transition between the stable states. A tri-trophic resource-consumer-predator food chain model has been revisited here that shows bistability and transition to monostability via a border collision that leads to a state of predator extinction. Although earlier studies have partially revealed the dynamics of such transitions, we would like to present additional and precise information by analyzing the system from the perspective of basin stability. By drawing different bifurcation diagrams against three important parameters, using different initial conditions, we identify the range of parameter values within which the stability of the states persists and changes to various complex dynamics. We emphasize the changes in the geometry of the basins of attraction and get a quantitative estimate of the nature of relative changes in the area of the basins (basin stability) during the transitions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of a down-up control, in addition to the conventional bottom-up and top-down control phenomena in the food chain. The application of basin stability in food networks will go a long way for accurate analysis of their dynamics. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

AB The international trade in exotic vertebrate pets provides key social and economic benefits but also drives associated ecological, ethical, and human health impacts. However, despite its clear importance, we currently lack a full understanding of the structure of the pet trade, hampering efforts to optimize its benefits while mitigating its negative effects. In the present article, we represent and review the structure of the pet trade as a network composed of different market actors (nodes) and trade flows (links). We identify key data gaps in this network that, if filled, would enable network analyses to pinpoint targets for management. As a case study of how data-informed networks can realize this goal, we quantified spatial and temporal patterns in pets imported to the United States. Our framework and case study illustrate how network approaches can help to inform and manage the effects of the growing demand for exotic pets.

AB Disturbed African tropical forests and woodlands have the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. Therefore, there is a need to understand how carbon stocks of disturbed and recovering tropical forests are determined by environmental conditions and human use. In this case study, we explore how gradients in environmental conditions and human use determine aboveground biomass (AGB) in 1958 national forest inventory (NFI) plots located in forests and woodlands in mainland Tanzania. Plots were divided into recovering forests (areas recovering from deforestation for <25years) and established forests (areas consistently defined as forests for 25 years). This division, as well as the detection of year of forest establishment, was obtained through the use of dense satellite time series of forest cover probability. In decreasing order of importance, AGB in recovering forests unexpectedly decreased with water availability, increased with surrounding tree cover and time since establishment, and decreased with elevation, distance to roads, and soil phosphorus content. AGB in established forests unexpectedly decreased with water availability, increased with surrounding tree cover, and soil nitrogen content, and decreased with elevation. AGB in recovering forests increased by 0.4 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1) during the first 20 years following establishment. Our results can serve as the basis of carbon sink estimates in African recovering tropical forests and woodlands, and aid in forest landscape restoration planning.

TI Ecological correlates of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii)
   density in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Understanding the ecological factors that drive animal density patterns in time and space is key to devising effective conservation strategies. In Tanzania, most chimpanzees (similar to 75%) live outside national parks where human activities threaten their habitat's integrity and connectivity. Mahale Mountains National Park (MMNP), therefore, is a critical area for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the region due to its location and protective status. Yet, despite its importance and long history of chimpanzee research (>50 years), a park-wide census of the species has never been conducted. The park is categorized as a savanna-woodland mosaic, interspersed with riparian forest, wooded grassland, and bamboo thicket. This heterogeneous landscape offers an excellent opportunity to assess the ecological characteristics associated with chimpanzee density, a topic still disputed, which could improve conservation plans that protect crucial chimpanzee habitat outside the park. We examined the influence of fine-scale vegetative characteristics and topographical features on chimpanzee nest density, modeling nest counts using hierarchical distance sampling. We counted 335 nests in forest and woodland habitats across 102 transects in 13 survey sites. Nests were disproportionately found more in or near evergreen forests, on steep slopes, and in feeding tree species. We calculated chimpanzee density in MMNP to be 0.23 ind/km(2), although density varied substantially among sites (0.09-3.43 ind/km(2)). Density was associated with factors related to the availability of food and nesting trees, with topographic heterogeneity and the total basal area of feeding tree species identified as significant positive predictors. Species-rich habitats and floristic diversity likely play a principal role in shaping chimpanzee density within a predominately open landscape with low food abundance. Our results provide valuable baseline data for future monitoring efforts in MMNP and enhance our understanding of this endangered species' density and distribution across Tanzania.

AB Plant-pollinator interactions significantly influence reproductive success (RS) and drive the evolution of pollination syndromes. In the context of RS, mainly the role of flower morphology is touched. The importance of nectar properties is less studied, despite its significance in pollination effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test selection on flower morphology and nectar chemistry in the generalistic orchid Neottia ovata. In 2019-2020, we measured three floral displays and six flower traits, pollinaria removal (PR), female reproductive success (FRS), and determined the soil properties. The sugars and amino acids (AAs) were analyzed using the HPLC method. Data were analyzed using multiple statistical methods (boxplots, ternary plot, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and PCA). Variation of flower structure and nectar chemistry and their weak correlation with RS confirms the generalistic character of N. ovata. In particular populations, different traits were under selection. PR was high and similar in all populations in both years, while FRS was lower and varied among populations. Nectar was dominated by glucose, fructose, and included 28 AAs (Ala and Glu have the highest content). Sugars and AAs influenced mainly FRS. Among soil parameters, carbon and carbon:nitrogen ratio seems to be the most important in shaping flower structure and nectar chemistry.

AB Toxin-producing cyanobacteria can be harmful to aquatic biota, although some grazers utilize them with often beneficial effects on their growth and reproduction. It is commonly assumed that gut microbiota facilitates host adaptation to the diet; however, the evidence for adaptation mechanisms is scarce. Here, we investigated the abundance of mlrA genes in the gut of the Baltic copepods Acartia bifilosa and Eurytemora affinis during cyanobacteria bloom season (August) and outside it (February). The mlrA genes are unique to microcystin and nodularin degraders, thus indicating the capacity to break down these toxins by the microbiota. The mlrA genes were expressed in the copepod gut year-round, being >10-fold higher in the summer than in the winter populations. Moreover, they were significantly more abundant in Eurytemora than Acartia. To understand the ecological implications of this variability, we conducted feeding experiments using summer- and winter-collected copepods to examine if/how the mlrA abundance in the microbiota affect: (1) uptake of toxic Nodularia spumigena, (2) uptake of a non-toxic algal food offered in mixtures with N. spumigena, and (3) concomitant growth potential in the copepods. The findings provide empirical evidence that the occurrence of mlrA genes in the copepod microbiome facilitates nutrient uptake and growth when feeding on phytoplankton mixtures containing nodularin-producing cyanobacteria; thus, providing an adaptation mechanism to the cyanobacteria blooms.

AB Aims Water and nitrogen availability are primary determinants of woody communities in dryland ecosystems and are strongly affected by global change. However, the mechanisms by which resource availability and plant demographic responses regulate woody-herb composition are unclear.
   Methods We investigated plant productivity, shrub demography, and resource availability in a 5-year field experiment involving three levels of precipitation (ambient, + 20% precipitation, + 40% precipitation) and two levels of nitrogen addition (0, 60 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) in a desert shrubland of northern China.
   Results Increased precipitation had similar positive effects on shrub and herbaceous productivity and, thus, did not alter the community composition. However, nitrogen enrichment dramatically increased herbaceous productivity but tended to decrease shrub productivity. Five years after the experimental manipulation, increased precipitation and nitrogen enrichment significantly altered shrub demography. Increased precipitation decreased the number and cover of small shrubs but increased those of large shrubs. Nitrogen enrichment largely decreased the number and cover of small shrubs, whereas large shrubs showed a higher resistance. Structural equation modeling revealed that nitrogen-enhanced herbaceous competition for water and light potentially reduced shrub growth, especially the growth of small shrubs.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that large shrubs can coexist with herbs, whereas small shrubs tend to be competitively excluded from the system under enhanced precipitation and nitrogen deposition. Nitrogen enrichment may lead to continued declines in shrub recruitment and growth, and a conversion to grassland. Our findings highlight the competitive and demographic mechanisms underlying the responses of woody communities to global change.

AB Grazing lands provide many goods and ecosystem services, such as forage, livestock, soil carbon (C) storage, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of grazing lands requires optimal management to simultaneously balance livestock productivity for sustaining human food and nutritional demands while reducing environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and soil degradation. In this paper, we revisit grazing management in grazing lands exposed to different grazing systems. In Section 2, we briefly review parameterization and multi-faceted goals for sustainability of grazing systems considering broader sustainability from economic to environmental aspects. We also discuss the inconsistencies between grazing researchers and ranchers' practices. In Section 3, we review the separate experimental data to examine the impacts of multipaddock rotational grazing on soil carbon, nutrient and GHGs. In Section 4, we present status and upcoming challenges in monitoring and upscaling of grazing ecosystem research and management. In Section 5, new concepts of multiple source monitoring networks are presented that enable the analysis of scale-dependent processes. Finally, we point out future directions for monitoring and assessment of managing soil C and GHG emissions from grazing lands. The results show that the inconsistences are essentially due to (1) effects of spatiotemporal scales on both economic and ecological outcomes, and (2) simplistic representations of multi-faceted grazing systems and sustainability. The development of multi-faceted monitoring systems needs to be further parametrized and standardized to make consistent for meaningful and comparable assessment of grazing management impacts on SOC and GHGs.

AB Long-term field studies help unveil mechanisms of grass soil seed bank (SSB) persistence and resilience. We wonder whether grazing is a disruptive force that changes grass SSB composition and size, while heavy rainfall is a positive bottom-up force that restores the grass SSB in grazed areas of the Monte desert, Argentina. We used core sampling to study the grass SSB in cattle-free (17 year) and grazed (10 year) grasslands. The SSB size in cattle-free sites usually responded in a continuous positive fashion to rainfall, and the proportion of palatable grasses in the SSB was similar among years. Most grass species formed a transient SSB, but the presence of a stand of perennial plants would prevent their local extinction. In contrast, the SSB size in the grazed habitats showed a threshold response to rainfall (i.e. it did not increase under low-moderate rainfall), the seeds of palatable grasses were always scarce, and the proportion of seeds of less palatable grasses increased under extreme rainy conditions. Seed production from grasses that grew tillers from axillary buds during a drought was zero, suggesting that the bank of plants could have a role in the replenishment of the grass SSB only in mesic years. Within the time span assessed here, continuous heavy grazing together with scarce as well as heavy rainfall were disruptive forces that reduced the number and proportion of seeds from palatable grasses in the SSB, which are also the species preferred by seed-eating animals.

AB Background: Low altitude Mopaneveld savanna in the northeastern parts of South Africa is generally well conserved. However, extensive copper mining, agricultural practices and urbanisation in the Phalaborwa region prompted research on the possible effects of land-use change on plant community diversity and function. Species diversity measures are usually considered adequate to assess disturbance effects to inform conservation efforts and management practices. However, diversity measures based on species level accounts often limit the outcomes of these studies as this approach fails to quantify how disturbances affect ecosystem functioning when community assembly, and not species diversity alone, is altered by land-use change.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to apply both species and functional diversity measures to a data set derived from various land-use types (i.e. areas exposed to strip mining activities, communal farming practices and conservation) in the Phalaborwa region to examine the effects of land-use change on the community ecology of the herbaceous layer.
   Results: Land-use change, particularly severe top-soil disturbances through strip mining activities, had a significant filtering effect on all measures of species diversity, though functional evenness was maintained across land-use types.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that, despite initial species loss, this particular savanna ecosystem is buffered against anthropogenic disturbances through functional stability. Indicator species analyses, as well as relationships between plant functional types and land-use change, revealed that forb species are largely responsible for ecosystem stability in areas exposed to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Landscape connectivity is a critical component of dynamic processes that link the structure and function of networks at the landscape scale. In the Anthropocene, connectivity across a landscape-scale network is influenced not only by biophysical land use features, but also by characteristics and patterns of the social landscape. This is particularly apparent in urban landscapes, which are highly dynamic in land use and often in social composition. Thus, landscape connectivity, especially in cities, must be thought of in a social-ecological framework. This is relevant when considering ecosystem services-the benefits that people derive from ecological processes and properties. As relevant actors move through a connected landscape-scale network, particular services may "flow" better across space and time. For this special issue on dynamic landscape connectivity, we discuss the concept of social-ecological networks using urban landscapes as a focal system to highlight the importance of social-ecological connectivity to understand dynamic urban landscapes, particularly in regards to the provision of urban ecosystem services.

AB Ecosystem services (ES), commonly defined as the benefits people get from ecosystems, are key components in improving human well-being. However, as land utilization transitions from forest and agricultural land to urban areas and industrial complexes, the continuous provision of ES is affected. To ensure sustainable development, conservation programs should be implemented that consider both the stakeholders' well-being while also maintaining ecosystem health and integrity. Consequently, to improve the strategic implementation of conservation programs, it is critical to understand stakeholders' preferences.
   Using an online survey, we elicited South Carolina residents' preference in prioritizing the target ecosystems and ecosystem services in the state. The results identified that the priority ecosystem service is water quality regulation. However, the residents' preference for water quality regulation does not discredit the importance of maintaining the continuous water supply provision. In terms of ecosystem preference, residents indicated that the forest ecosystem is the priority ecosystem to be conserved, particularly for younger residents, respondents with high income, and those in the midland and the upstate. This could be attributed to the forest's effect on the ecosystem services that these respondents receive, particularly towards water-related ecosystem services. Understanding the residents' preference provides information that could improve the state water plans and other potential policy implications to land use-land cover planning and landscape sustainability management.

AB Two of the world's most invasive ants, Linepithema humile and Lasius neglectus, are destined to overlap in range as they continue to spread throughout Europe. Although L. humile arrived first, and is therefore more numerically abundant, L. neglectus is the more behaviorally dominant of the two. We performed lab trials to determine whether L. humile could use numerical abundance to overcome the behavioral dominance of L. neglectus and whether the ants' behavioral patterns shifted when the species co-occurred. We found that L. neglectus was more aggressive when less abundant, whereas the opposite was true of L. humile. When L. neglectus was outnumbered, it employed aggressive behaviors, such as biting or chemical attacks, more frequently than L. humile; it also utilized a behavioral sequence that included mandible opening and biting. Our results for these species support the hypothesis that species modulate their behavior towards competitors, which facilitates the understanding of how multiple invasive ant species can co-occur in a given area. Moreover, our study shows that the co-occurrence of invasive species could result from the use of two strategies: (1) the Bourgeois strategy, in which aggressiveness changes based on numerical dominance and (2) the dear-enemy strategy, in which aggressiveness is reduced when competitors co-occur. Since these strategies may lead to territory partitioning, we suggest that the behavioral flexibility displayed by both species when they overlap may allow local co-occurrence and increase their likelihood of co-occurrence during their range expansion in Europe, which could have a negative cumulative impact on invaded areas.

AB Previous research has shown that African lions (Panthera leo) have the ability to discriminate between conspecific vocalisations, but little is known about how individual identity is conveyed in the spectral structure of roars. Using acoustic - accelerometer biologgers that allow vocalisations to be reliably associated with individual identity, we test for vocal individuality in the fundamental frequency (f0) of roars from 5 male lions, firstly by comparing simplef0 summary features and secondly by modelling the temporal pattern of thef0 contour. We then assess the application of this method for discriminating between individuals using passive acoustic monitoring. Results indicate thatf0 summary features only allow for vocal discrimination with 70.7% accuracy. By comparison, vocal discrimination can be achieved with an accuracy of 91.5% based on individual differences in the temporal pattern of thef0 sequence. We further demonstrate that passively recorded lion roars can be localised and differentiated with similar accuracy. The existence of individually uniquef0 contours in lion roars and their relatively lower attenuation indicates a likely mechanism enabling individual lions to identify conspecifics over long distances. These differences can be exploited by researchers to track individuals across the landscape and thereby supplement conventional lion monitoring approaches.

AB Simple Summary
   Wildlife farming is a practice where wild animals are legally bred for consumption in a manner similar to agricultural animals. This is a controversial conservation practice that also has implications for animal welfare and human livelihoods. However, most work on wildlife farming has focused solely on conservation or animal welfare rather than considering all of these ethical factors simultaneously. This paper uses interview data with academics to analyze (a) the harms and benefits of wildlife farms and (b) how wildlife farms are labeled detrimental (stigmatized) or acceptable. Results indicate that consideration of the harms and benefits of wildlife farms incorporate conservation, animal welfare, scale disparities between sustenance and commercial farms, consumer preferences, species differences, the dynamics of demand for wildlife products, and governance. Whether wildlife farms are stigmatized or accepted is influenced by different social constructions of the term "wildlife farm", if there is a stigma around use of a species, a form of production, or the perceived quality of a wildlife product, cultural differences, consumer preferences, geopolitical factors, and demand reduction efforts. This paper discusses how the ethics of wildlife farms are constructed and how shifts in context can alter the ethical repercussions of wildlife farms.
   Wildlife farming, the commercial breeding and legal sale of non-domesticated species, is an increasingly prevalent, persistently controversial, and understudied conservation practice. The adoption or rejection of wildlife farms is a complex process that incorporates numerous ethical considerations: conservation, livelihoods, animal welfare, and cultural practices. This paper uses qualitative interview data with key informants (academics) to analyze (a) the harms and benefits of wildlife farms and (b) the factors that influence whether wildlife farms are stigmatized or accepted. In evaluations of wildlife farming's harms and benefits, respondents incorporated multiple considerations: animal welfare, environmental impacts, scale disparities between sustenance and commercial farms, consumer preferences, species differences, the substitutability and accessibility of wildlife products, and governance. The results further indicated that the stigmatization or acceptance of wildlife farms is affected by the "wildlife farm" label, if there is a stigma around use of a species, a form of production, or the perceived quality of a wildlife product, cultural differences in wildlife use, wildlife consumer typology, geopolitical factors, and demand reduction efforts. This paper analyzes the complexities of wildlife farming such that stakeholders can understand the impacts of this practice on species, human communities, individual animals, and the legal and illegal wildlife trades.

AB According to ecological theory, two species cannot occupy the same niche. Using nitrogen isotope analyses (delta N-15) of amino acids, we tested the extent to which two sympatric deposit-feeding amphipods,Monoporeia affinisandPontoporeia femorata, partition their trophic resources. We found that trophic position (TP) and resynthesis index ( n-ary sumation V; a proxy for degradation status of ingested material prior to assimilation by the consumer) differ between species. The surface-feedingM. affinishad higher TP and intermediate n-ary sumation V, both pointing to a large contribution of metazoans in its diet.P. femorata, which feeds in the subsurface layers, had lower TP and a bimodal distribution of the n-ary sumation V values, supporting previous experimental evidence of a larger feeding niche. We also evaluated whether TP and n-ary sumation V values have consequences for amphipod fecundity and embryo viability and found that embryo viability inM. affiniswas negatively linked to TP. Our results indicate that the amino acid-delta N-15 data paired with information about reproductive status are useful for detecting differences in the trophic ecology of sympatric amphipods.

AB Trade and transport of goods is widely accepted as a primary pathway for the introduction and dispersal of invasive species. However, understanding commodity flows remains a challenge owing to its complex nature, unavailability of quality data, and lack of systematic modeling methods. A robust network-based approach is proposed to model seasonal flow of agricultural produce and examine its role in pest spread. It is applied to study the spread of Tuta absoluta, a devastating pest of tomato in Nepal. Further, the long-term establishment potential of the pest and its economic impact on the country are assessed. Our analysis indicates that regional trade plays an important role in the spread of T. absoluta. The economic impact of this invasion could range from USD 17-25 million. The proposed approach is generic and particularly suited for data-poor scenarios.

AB Variation in plant breeding systems has implications for pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits and the ecology of populations. Here we evaluate pollinator contribution to seed production, self-compatibility and pollen limitation in different floral colour forms ofDrosera cistiflora sensu lato(Droseraceae). These insectivorous perennial plants are endemic to fynbos and renosterveld vegetation in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and the species complex includes five floral colour forms (pink, purple, red, white and yellow), some of which are known to be pollinated by beetles. Controlled hand-pollination experiments were conducted in 15 populations ofD. cistiflora s.l.(two to four populations per floral colour form) to test whether the colour forms vary in their degree of self-compatibility and their ability to produce seeds through autonomous self-fertilization. Yellow-flowered forms were highly self-incompatible, while other floral colour forms exhibited partial self-compatibility. Seed set resulting from autonomous selfing was very low, and pollinator dependence indices were high in all populations. Since hand cross-pollination resulted in greater seed set than open pollination in 13 of the 15 populations, we inferred that seed production is generally pollen-limited. Drosera cistiflora s.l.typically exhibits high levels of pollinator dependence and pollen limitation. This is unusual amongDroseraspecies worldwide and suggests that pollinators are likely to mediate strong selection on attractive traits such as floral colour and size inD. cistiflora s.l. These results also suggest that the floral colour forms ofD. cistiflora s.l.which are rare and threatened are likely to be vulnerable to local extinction if mutualisms were to collapse indefinitely.

AB Species introductions threaten ecosystem function worldwide, and interactions among introduced species may amplify their impacts. Effects of multiple invasions are still poorly studied, and often, the mechanisms underlying potential interactions among invaders are unknown. Despite being a remote and well-conserved area, the southern portion of South America has been greatly impacted by invasions of both the American beaver (Castor canadensis) and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta fario). Here, we compared growth, condition, diet, and stable isotopes of sulfur delta S-34, nitrogen delta N-15, and carbon delta C-13 for stream-living Brown Trout from streams with (n = 6) and without (n = 6) beaver in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. We show that beaver may facilitate the success of trout by positively influencing fish growth. Beaver indirectly provide greater food subsidies (i.e., macroinvertebrate abundances) by modifying the local aquatic environment through active dam and lodge building suggesting a one-way positive interaction. Trout in beaver-influenced streams occupied a slightly higher trophic level with more depleted sulfur and carbon isotopic ratios suggesting that food web pathways rely on secondary production from autochthonous origin. Trout in beaver-influenced streams had a wider dietary breadth with diptera and amphipoda as the prey items providing most of the energy, whereas in streams without beaver, trichoptera were the main source of energy for trout. Ultimately, we find that these two species, which have never co-occurred naturally, bring about the same ecosystem function and the beneficial influences in their native ranges as in invaded systems.

AB In the process of developing new conservation policies, policymakers must have access to information which will inform their decisions. Evidence rarely considers the complexities of social-ecological systems. The Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) is an adaptable yet structured approach for understanding the processes that lead to changes in natural resources, using a systems-based approach that aims to treat ecological and social components equally. Few conservation planning and policy initiatives have implemented the SESF to assess the interlinked social and ecological consequences of conservation policies. We apply the SESF to explore the barriers to the potential implementation of a policy of consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya, a policy regarded as successful in several southern African countries. Using secondary data and expert review we developed a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya. We then analysed how different combinations of first and second-tier variables interacted to create focal action situations, and subsequently identified seven barriers to this policy. Our analysis revealed that game ranching would require large-scale investment in effective monitoring systems, new regulations, training, market development and research, considerations about equity, and devolved ownership of wildlife. The least barriers existed for game farming. The SESF appears to be a useful framework for this purpose. In particular, it can help to reveal potential social and ecological barriers which conservation policies might face in attempting to meet intended goals. The information required to implement the SESF are necessarily cross-disciplinary, which can make it challenging to synthesise.

AB We describe body growth functions of broad-snouted caimans (Caiman latirostris) for wild and reintroduced individuals. Snout-vent length (SVL, cm) and age of young individuals and adult females were recorded for two different groups: (Py) animals born in the Proyecto Yacare ranching program, from eggs collected in the wild; and (Wy) wild caimans Class I (< 25 an SVL) whose age was determined by Size Frequency Analysis, plus females reintroduced by the Proyecto Yacare and subsequently recaptured at reproductive age. To describe body growth, we adjusted five models through non-linear regression: Logistic, 4-Parameter Logistic (4-PL), Gompertz, 4-Parameter Gompertz (4-G), and von Bertalanffy. Each group was analyzed separately (Py and Wy), and we selected the most parsimonious model based on the Akaike criterion. We also analyzed the possible linear growth difference using ANCOVA. For Py, the Logistic model was best, whereas for Wy the most suitable was 4-PL, in which wild animals would arrive at the inflexion point 1.4 years later on average than in Py. Analyzing the stage at which their development was linear in shape, we detected that the wild animals had a similar growth rate to reintroduced individuals. As a result, although Py animals had experienced accelerated development whilst in captivity, it did not modify their subsequent growth in the wild. The likelihood of survival in this species increases with body size, thus it is important to emphasize that reintroduced animals are larger than wild animals of the same age and that previous farming conditions seem not to affect their growth in the wild. Therefore, we expect that reintroduced caimans will exhibit greater survivorship than natural animals of the same age. Consequently, an adjustment of the current ranching program should be considered, in the sense that population viability could be achieved by reintroducing a lower number of caimans each season.

AB Context Piospheres describe herbivore utilization gradients around watering points, as commonly found in grass-dominated ecosystems. Spatially explicit, dynamic models are ideal tools to study the ecological and economic problems associated with the resulting land degradation. However, there is a need for appropriate landscape input maps to these models that depict plausible initial vegetation patterns under a range of scenarios. Objectives Our goal was to develop a spatially-explicit piosphere landscape generator (PioLaG) for semi-arid savanna rangelands with a focus on realistic vegetation zones and spatial patterns of basic plant functional types around livestock watering points. Methods We applied a hybrid modelling approach combining aspects of both process- and pattern-based modelling. Exemplary parameterization of PioLaG was based on literature data and expert interviews in reference to Kalahari savannas. PioLaG outputs were compared with piosphere formations identified on aerial images. Results PioLaG allowed to create rangeland landscapes with piospheres that can be positioned within flexible arrangements of grazing units (camps). The livestock utilization gradients showed distinct vegetation patterns around watering points, which varied according to the pre-set initial rangeland condition, grazing regime and management type. The spatial characteristics and zoning of woody and herbaceous vegetation were comparable to real piosphere patterns. Conclusions PioLaG can provide important input data for spatial rangeland models that simulate site-specific savanna dynamics. The created landscapes can also be used as a direct decision support for land managers in attempts to maintain or restore landscape functionality and key ecosystem services such as forage production.

AB The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is globally known for its plant biodiversity, and its flora is commonly referred to as fynbos. At the same time, this area is under severe pressure from urbanization, agricultural expansion and the threat of invasive alien plants.Acacia,EucalyptusandPinusare the common invasive alien plants found across the biome and considerable time, effort and resources are put into the removal of invasive alien plants and the rehabilitation of native vegetation. Several studies have shown that invasion not only affects the composition of plant species, but also has a profound effect on the soil chemistry and microbial populations. Over the last few years, a number of studies have shown that the microbial populations of the CFR are unique to the area, and harbour many endemic species. The extent of the role they play in the invasion process is, however, still unclear. This review aims to provide an insight into the current knowledge on the different microbial populations from this system, and speculate what their role might be during invasion. More importantly, it places a spotlight on the lack of information about this process.

AB Pachygrapsus marmoratus is a common coastal crab occurring in rocky shores of the northeastern Atlantic. The species presents a planktonic larval phase, constituting an interesting subject for dispersal studies, given the larval release in intertidal areas, followed by the exportation to shelf waters where larval development takes place. Onshore migration to the adult habitats is thought to be performed by the megalopa stage.
   Observations obtained during a summer zooplankton survey showed P. marmoratus larvae gradually farther from the coast throughout larval development, with early larval stages found in surface layers and megalopae occurring closer to the coast. The vertical migration mechanisms for larval dispersal and the return to settlement habitats were tested through physical-ecological models where the vertical distributions changed through the larval development. Ecological data, such as the ontogenetic vertical distribution of each larval stage, larval duration, and time and sites of spawning, were integrated in an oceanic model. Simulations tested different vertical distributions and periods, covering the entire larval development from intertidal areas to shelf and back to shore. The distribution of the early stages in surface layers promoted cross- and alongshore transport. Differences in the initial advection determined the positions where the more advanced stages were found later in the development. The subsurface distribution of advanced stages facilitated the transport to the inner shelf, limiting the cross-shore upwelling transport and promoting higher return to the adult habitats. Different periods of larval release resulted in contrasting dispersal patterns that could influence larval survival and recruitment to adult populations.

AB In recent years, development of sustainable and ecological food production has gained worldwide interest. It seems clear that this phenomenon is causing changes in aquaculture-focused research, with the development of new integration systems. However, it is still necessary to understand different aspects involved in integrated systems, including co-culture systems such as shrimp and seaweed. This study evaluated the effect of green seaweeds as food source on white shrimp Penaeus vannamei intestinal bacterial communities. Shrimp were evaluated after a 4-week experimental trial under different diet treatments: fed with only pellet (P), only Ulva clathrata (UC), U. clathrata + pellet (UCP), only Ulva lactuca (UL), and U. lactuca + pellet (ULP). In terms of growth and survival, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were found between ULP and UCP treatments compared with the control (P). Analysis of the bacterial biota of shrimp intestine revealed significant differences on community composition in ULP, UL, and UC compared with the control (P) (P < 0.05). We found that Proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in all treatments, followed by Bacteroidetes for UC, UCP, and UL and Actinobacteria for P and ULP treatments. Shrimp fed only with seaweed U. lactuca (UL, ULP) had a significantly higher abundance of Rubritalea, Lysinibacillus, Acinetobacter, and Blastopirellula, and for U. clathrata treatments (UC, UCP), it was Litoreibacter. Relative abundance of Vibrio was higher in the control (P), showing a decrease in UC and UL treatments. Our findings provide a better understanding of integrated aquaculture systems, specifically those utilizing seaweed as natural feed source.

AB What factors determine biome richness: genetic or environmental? Sex, phylogeny, and tolerance indicated by other symbionts (e.g., endosymbionts) or simply is it related to local habitat, especially if the gut biome is considered? To answer these questions, we investigated the gut microbial profile of both sexes of three Unio crassus populations, species with unique system of mitochondrial DNA inheritance called doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI), living in different ecological conditions. High-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragment was performed, which resulted in a total of 1,051,647 reads, with 58,424 reads/65 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) per sample on average. We identified a core microbiome, with all individual mussels sharing 69 OTUs (representing 23% of the total number of OTUs). Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. There were no significant differences in gut microbiome compositions between the two sexes of this species; however, we observed different phyla in geographically isolated populations. A non-metric multidimensional scaling plot and dendrogram showed that the bacterial profile complies with the genetic structure of populations. Although we found differences in microbiomes between populations, their genetic structure suggests that the microbiome is weakly related to habitat, and more strongly to phylogeography (on both F and M mitotypes). We found no significant differences in beta diversity between the individuals of the bacterial communities measured using the Bray-Curtis index. Finally, we also examined whether OTUs were represented by symbiotic bacteria that enable cellulose digestion and by endosymbiotic bacteria that play important functions in the biology of their hosts and also affect microevolutionary processes and population phenomena. With regard to the endosymbionts, however, there was no relation to sex of the studied individuals, which suggests that there are no straightforward relations between DUI and microbiome.

AB Termite mounds create nutrient hotspots that serve as key resource areas for savanna vegetation and mammalian herbivores. However, despite the key ecological roles performed by termite mounds, few studies have investigated their influence on invertebrate communities, and none have examined such effects across environmental gradients. We hypothesised that termite mounds would support greater numbers of invertebrates than the surrounding savanna matrix and that assemblages would differ in composition due to the enhanced nutritional quality of vegetation on mounds. We also predicted that the differences between on-mound and off-mound invertebrate diversity would be more pronounced in areas where the difference in nutritional value between mounds and the savanna matrix vegetation was most prominent. We tested these hypotheses in Kruger National Park, South Africa, by sampling ground- and grass-dwelling invertebrate herbivores, omnivores and detritivores on and at various distances away from termite mounds at three savanna sites of varying vegetation quality across a rainfall gradient. All invertebrate groups sampled responded to termite mounds, but mound influence varied across trophic groups (Orthoptera showed the clearest patterns), diversity measures (changes in abundance rather than species richness) and with mean annual rainfall (strongest effects at the highest rainfall site). Orthoptera were more abundant on mounds, particularly at the wettest site, and there was a positive relationship between mound size and Orthoptera species richness. Ant assemblage composition on mounds differed from that off mounds and beetle abundance was greater on mounds, possibly as a result of concentrated mammalian herbivore activity and faecal deposition on mounds. Our results suggest that termite mounds are not only important nutrient and foraging hotspots for vertebrates, but that they also introduce heterogeneity in invertebrate communities, especially in nutrient-poor savannas.

AB The challenge of mapping savanna vegetation has limited our understanding of the factors that shape these ecosystems at large scales. We tested seven methods for mapping savanna woody cover (trees and shrubs; WC) across 12 protected areas (PAs) in eastern Africa using Landsat 8 imagery. Because we wanted a method viable for mapping across the often-limited Landsat historical archive, we limited ourselves to three images: one each from the wet, dry, and transition (halfway between wet and dry) seasons. Models were trained and tested using 1,330 WC reference points and the variance explained by cross validation (VEcv) accuracy metric. Of the methods we tested, RF significantly (p < 0.001) outperformed the others with the best models in nine PAs scoring over 75% (range of 34.5%-91.1%). RF models trained using data from all the PAs and tested in the individual PAs significantly (p < 0.001) outperformed their single-PA-derived counterparts (67.7 +/- 23.3% versus 30.5 +/- 27.4%). We also found that while the transition image appears to be critical to mapping WC and the wet season image should be avoided, no single season or seasonal combination significantly outperformed all the others, allowing some flexibility in image selection. Our findings show that with proper sampling of landscape heterogeneity, even with limited imagery, accurate maps of savanna WC are possible and could catalyze discoveries in this crucial biome.

AB Invasive species can introduce parasites to, and/or acquire new parasites from, novel regions, thereby greatly influencing community interactions, including symbiotic relationships involving parasites. Host-switching of native and non-native parasites could enhance or dilute parasite transmission and spread among hosts. We investigated the effect of host invasion on trematode parasitism in 2 Newfoundland (Canada) bays: one invaded by European green crabs Carcinus maenas and the other not yet invaded. To determine the influence of C. maenas on host- parasite relationships, we assessed trematode prevalence in 3 native hosts: 2 Littarina spp. snails and Atlantic rock crabs Cancer irroratus (first- and second-intermediate hosts for microphallid trematodes, respectively). We found no difference in trematode prevalence between the bays among the 4 host species. However, cyst abundance was significantly higher in C. maenas versus C. irroratus in the bay where the crab distributions overlap, while it was lower in C. irroratus in the invaded versus uninvaded bay, suggesting a dilution of infection in the native host. Sequencing data of microphallid trematodes detected 4 genetically divergent lineages: a cosmopolitan lineage found in all host species; 2 lineages dominant in C. irroratus, suggesting a native origin for the trematodes that now use C. maenas as an additional host; and 1 lineage represented just in C. maenas in Europe. This is the first study to demonstrate the magnitude of trematode infection in crab hosts in Newfoundland, including the commercially valuable native C. irroratus. Our results demonstrate the influence that species introductions can have on parasite life cycles in native systems under recent host invasion.

AB When a species moves into a new area, direct contests with functionally similar residents may determine whether they can establish themselves. In recent years, the web-building cellar spider, Pholcus manueli, has largely displaced its larger well-established congener, Pholcus phalangioides, in SW Ohio. The relationship between these two species is interesting both because they are congeners and because both are invasive; the resident, P. phalangioides, had robust populations in the area for more than 100 years. We hypothesized that this example of over-invasion was related to interactions over web sites or webs. We first staged interspecific contests between adult females over empty web sites and existing webs in the laboratory. The smaller P. manueli never won but many encounters ended as ties with little active engagement between the spiders. We then staged contests with juvenile spiders that were close in size. We introduced well-fed or food-limited P. manueli into webs of P. phalangioides. In these matches, the relative size difference, a proxy for resource holding potential, determined the outcome. However, fights involving well-fed P. manueli were shorter and more aggressive than contests with hungry individuals. Additionally, well-fed invaders were more likely to take over webs whilst hungry P. manueli were less likely to engage in contests, thus allowing coexistence. We posited that newly introduced individuals, immersed in a population of P. phalangioides, persisted on the sidelines of the resident's webs, and engaged in interspecific aggression only when the dynamics of the interaction were in their favor.

AB The role of individual plant species, including those that are rare or invasive, in the structure of plant-pollinator networks will depend on how connected the plants are to pollinator species and when they flower. Plant species visited by a high diversity of pollinators that visit few other species during a particular time period are thought to provide high value to the insect community. Here, we examined the role of plant species in a plant-pollinator network across the entire flowering season and across dune and adjacent woodland habitats in Wisconsin, USA. We found strong turnover of plants, pollinators, and their interactions in time and space. Both native and exotic species play important structural roles in plant-pollinator networks. Simulations reveal that the loss of the early-flowering rare plant, Cirsium pitcheri, would result in a disproportionate loss of pollinator species. Furthermore, the critical role that this species plays in the network is not replaced by its exotic relative, Centaurea stoebe. Our research demonstrates that consideration of temporal and spatial variability in networks allows for critical plant species to be identified within a plant-pollinator network that might otherwise be overlooked.

AB Understanding the patterns and drivers of the spread of exotic species is necessary for limiting their distributions and minimizing their impacts on biodiversity. Species that are spread unintentionally versus intentionally present distinct management challenges that must be addressed with unique solutions. We assessed the spread and impact of exotic gecko species in the greater Caribbean region-a taxa and region predicted to be conducive to a high rate of unintentionally spread exotic species. From the literature, we compiled a database of exotic gecko introductions to the greater Caribbean region, recording the year of introduction, introduction pathway, establishment success, habitat use, and ecological impacts. Exotic gecko species introductions have increased exponentially over time and geckos from multiple biogeographic realms are now present in the greater Caribbean region. Species from distant realms were largely introduced intentionally to Florida via the pet trade, whereas Caribbean endemics were mostly introduced to other Caribbean islands through unintentional or unknown pathways. Regardless of the introduction pathway, most introductions resulted in established populations, usually in anthropogenic habitat. Furthermore, the exotics, Hemidactylus mabouia and H. frenatus, appear to be on the 'winning' end of most species interactions, including those with other exotics. Overall, our results show exotic geckos are spreading both unintentionally and intentionally with a strong potential to displace native gecko species and impact ecosystems as generalist predators. As eradication success is usually low, future conservation efforts should focus on elucidating ecological impacts and preventing new introductions through pathway-specific trade policy, financial incentives, and education.

AB Bumblebees are important pollinating insects for a wide variety of crops and wild flowering plants, but many species are experiencing declines throughout the world due to multiple factors including nutritional stress. Bee nutrition may initially appear simple, with all species feeding exclusively on pollen and nectar. However, these flower resources come from a taxonomically diverse range of plants that are varied in their biochemistry and therefore in the nutritional value of their nectar and pollen. In addition, bumblebee nutritional requirements differ between castes and life-stages, and there are also a wide variety of differences between bumblebee species in their life-history traits, including methods of larval feeding and the flower taxa they prefer to forage on. As with all organisms, suboptimum nutrition (nutritional stress) can have significant effects on growth, development and survival, but our understanding of nutritional biology in bumblebees comes predominantly from just two species that are not representative of bumblebees in general, or of the species that are of greatest conservation concern. For the conservation of declining bumblebees and the sustainable management of healthy commercial colonies, understanding the nutritional biology of a greater diversity of species should therefore be a priority.

AB Paper presents a systematic global review of Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Ailanthus altissima, Robinia pseudoacacia invasions focusing on the Scopus and Web of Science databases. We examined the data on papers, study areas, habitat studied, topic discussed. We hypothesized that these species were studied evenly throughout their invaded ranges and, as such, indexed by international databases. We asked whether four selected species are presented evenly in publications related to their invaded ranges, and whether both selected databases cover well a content of these papers. We found 48 papers for A. negundo, 14 - for F. pennsylvanica, 83 - for A. altissima, 96 - for R. pseudoacacia. A high percentage of the studies were conducted in Central Europe and USA (for A. altissima), while Eastern Europe, Russia, Western United States were poorly represented. Most studies were conducted in forests, and focused on impacts or distribution of aliens in invaded range, and their control and management. We encountered habitat types invaded by trees, factors influencing tree invasions, consequences of invaders' impact on ecosystems, counteracting measures. We concluded that the use only Web of Science and Scopus is not sufficient to obtain the complete data about the invasion biology.

AB Recruitment of the limpet Patella ulyssiponensis was investigated in relation to the presence of living crustose coralline algae (CCA) in rocky-shore habitats. Juvenile limpets (<= 10 mm maximum shell length) were counted in CCA-present and CCA-absent habitats, on three shores in SW Portugal during summer 2007 and winter 2009. Furthermore, the settling response of laboratory-reared larvae of P. ulyssiponensis to CCA-covered substratum, and bare-rock, was examined. Across the intertidal zone, we found a clear association between the distribution and abundance of juveniles and the presence of CCA. Although the presence of CCA was not an absolute requisite for juvenile occurrence, null juvenile densities were mostly recorded in CCA-absent areas. The highest juvenile densities (maximum of 64 individuals in 15 x 15 cm) were consistently found in CCA-dominated habitats, namely steep wave-exposed areas at low-shore and rock-pools. The hypothesis of CCA-enhanced settlement was not supported, as settlement intensities of laboratory-reared larvae were similar between chips of rock encrusted by CCA and chips of bare-rock. From the overall number of settlers onto CCA-encrusted rock chips, 51% were found in tiny pits lacking CCA. This was the first study of the settlement patterns of larvae of the genus Patella using naturally occurring rocky substrata. These results are preliminary and should be confirmed with choice-experiments and improved monitoring of the position of settlers. We suggest that CCA plays a role in the recruitment of P. ulyssiponensis, potentially promoting survivorship of early benthic stages, but possibly not enhancing settlement.

AB Vegetation near bird and seal rookeries typically has high delta N-15 signatures and these high values are linked to the enriched delta N-15 values of rookery soils. However, Antarctic cryptogams are mostly dependent on atmospheric ammonia (NH3) and volatized NH3 from rookeries is severely depleted in delta N-15-NH3. So there is an apparent discrepancy between the isotopically depleted source (NH3) and delta N-15-enriched vegetation. In this article, we aim to resolve this discrepancy to better understand the mechanisms and processes involved in isotopic changes during nitrogen transfer between Antarctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Under laboratory conditions, we quantified whether volatized NH3 affects the isotopic signature of cryptogams. NH3 volatilizing from penguin guano and elephant seal dung was depleted (44-49 parts per thousand) in delta N-15 when captured on acidified filters, compared to the source itself. Cryptogams exposed to the volatized NH3 were enriched (18.8-23.9 parts per thousand) in delta N-15. The moss Andreaea regularis gained more nitrogen (0.9%) than the lichen Usnea antarctica (0.4%) from volatilized NH3, indicating a potential difference in atmospheric NH3 acquisition that is consistent with existing field differences in nitrogen concentrations and delta N-15 between mosses and lichens in general. This study clarifies the delta N-15 enrichment of cryptogams resulting from one of the most important nitrogen pathways for Antarctic vegetation.

AB Feeding restriction is a strategy in shrimp farming management that may promote compensatory growth after feeding is re-established. This study aims to evaluate the effects of two feeding restriction regimens on the compensatory growth and digestive enzymes activity of Litopenaeus vannamei reared in biofloc system. Juvenile shrimp (0.46 +/- 0.18 g) were stocked (320 individuals/m(3)) in 310 L tanks. The experiment comprised two phases: (a) Feeding Restriction (30 days) when shrimp were submitted to three feeding regimes, Control (fed daily), R1F1 (repetitively fasted one day and fed one day) and R2F1 (repetitively fasted 2 days and fed 1 day); and (b) Refeeding (28 days) when shrimp were fed daily. In the restriction phase, shrimp growth and digestive enzyme activities were reduced in R2F1 and R1F1. However, during the refeeding phase, enzyme activities and feed conversion improve significantly in R2F1 and R1F1. Control group attained higher final weight, but its final biomass was similar to R1F1. Litopenaeus vannamei exhibited partial compensatory growth, probably due to improved feed conversion efficiency driven by increased enzyme activity. It is possible to reduce feeding by 50% (R1F1) in biofloc systems for 28 days, without compromising the biomass produced at the end of a 30-day refeeding period.

AB Drivers of species productivity and ecosystem function are of great ecological significance. In fire-prone ecosystems, dispersion patterns of important pollinator species are driven by the various fire events over space and time. However, different species have varying responses to fire intensity and frequency. Here, we assess how time since last fire influences abundance, composition, and dispersion patterns of flowering plants and anthophiles in a highly fire-prone landscape. We classified study area into age since last fire, which were <1 yr (short-term burned), 2-3 yr (medium-term burned), and 9-10 yr (long-term burned). We collected insect anthophiles using yellow, blue, and white pan traps at sites established in each post-fire class. We also estimated flower abundance at each study site. Overall, anthophile abundance was highest in medium-term burned, while lowest in short-term burned sites. Also, flower abundance was highest at medium-term burned and lowest in long-term burned sites. Species composition of flowering plants and anthophiles, especially bees and flies, differed significantly across post-fire class. Overall, flower abundance had a significant positive effect on bee abundance. Of all the taxa, bees were the only group that showed dispersion patterns reflecting those of flower abundance. Other factors, especially requirements for other resources such as logs, drive the distribution of other anthophile taxa, especially flies. We conclude that fire drives the distribution patterns of bees through its direct effect on flower abundance and composition in a fire-prone landscape. While high frequency of short-term fire may reduce flower abundance, flower-rich areas with moderate time since fire may increase diversity of anthophiles in this fire-prone landscape.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover (MOD44B) is an annual product that depicts the fractional coverage of trees on the earth's terrestrial surface at 250m resolution. It has to be noted that the training data of this product is limited to trees above 5 m in height. However, this product has been widely applied in savanna ecosystems where many woody plant species seldom reach 5 m tall. Though the short woody plants in savanna ecosystems could have been reflected in this product due to similar spectral implication as that of tall trees, its applicability has never been rigorously tested. Given so, this study aims to fill this void. It was tested in Texas savanna, which is featured by a wide precipitation gradient and an accompanying woody plant cover gradation. Firstly, we assessed the ability of the MODIS tree cover product in reflecting woody plant cover at pixel level. A per-pixel comparison was conducted between the tree cover values and reference measurement of woody plant cover based on 1-m resolution digital orthophotos. Secondly, we assessed the ability of this tree cover product in reflecting savanna landscape pattern, particularly the potential woody cover pattern over the precipitation gradient in Texas savanna. The MODIS tree cover product based potential woody cover pattern was assessed against the reference pattern of the study area. Thirdly, we assessed the year-to-year consistency of this annual product, under the assumption that tree cover changes very little within one-year period. Reduced major axis regression was conducted between the corresponding tree cover pixels of all successive years from 2000 to 2016. Research results suggest that the MODIS tree cover product has great potential in reflecting woody plant cover at pixel level by empirical calibration. Moreover, this tree cover product demonstrates the ability of revealing the increasing trend of potential woody cover with mean annual precipitation (MAP) across Texas savanna. Furthermore, the lack of temporal consistency is revealed for this annual product. It is worth noting that the potential woody cover pattern endowed by the precipitation gradient in Texas savanna is in a three-segment shape.

AB Illegal wildlife trade is a lucrative business, which is driving many species towards extinction. Pangolins (Manis spp.) and arapaimas (Arapaima spp.) are two CITES listed genera coveted in the leather fashion industry for their unique skin pattern. The US has contributed to the decline of pangolin species and was historically a large market for pangolin leather products. While the US trade in pangolin products has declined since 2000, we suspect that pangolin leather may now be substituted by arapaima products. Arapaima leather trade has increased significantly since the year 2011. We found a strong positive correlation between the US states trading in both arapaima and pangolin leather products. The US states that were most involved in this trade had a lower population density and were comparatively wealthier than others. Leather items of both arapaima and pangolin were found for sale on eBay, with 75% of incidents in breach of eBay policy, and potentially illegal. Pangolin leather products were also falsely advertised as arapaima products. We conclude that arapaima leather is increasingly used to satisfy the persisting demand for exotic leather, and further research is urgently needed to determine the effect of the trade on wild arapaima populations.

AB 1. Plant-animal mutualisms are key processes that influence community structure, dynamics, and function. They reflect several neutral and niche-based mechanisms related to plant-animal interactions. 2. However, the strength with which these processes influence community structure depends on functional traits that influence the interactions between mutualistic partners. In mutualisms involving plants and ants, nectar is the most common reward, and traits such as quantity and quality can affect ant species' responses by influencing their recruitment rates and aggressiveness. 3. In this study, nectar traits that mediate ant-plant defensive mutualisms were manipulated to test whether resource quantity and quality affect the structure of ant-plant interaction networks. A downscaling approach was used to investigate the interaction network between ant species and individual plants of the extrafloral nectary-bearing terrestrial orchid Epidendrum secundum. 4. We found a short-term reorganization of the ant assemblage that caused the interaction networks to become more specialised and modular in response to a more rewarding nectar gradient. Furthermore, the ant species tended to narrow their foraging range by limiting their associations to one or a few individual plants. 5. This study shows that ant species' responses to variable resource traits play an important role in the structure of the ant-plant interaction network. We suggest that more rewarding nectar enhanced aggressiveness and a massive recruitment of some ant species, leading to lower niche overlap and thus a less connected and more specialised network.

AB Trap-building antlion larvae detect their prey according to the substrate vibrations produced during movement of the prey on the sand surface. Although most studies are devoted to surface vibrational waves, in the present study, we determine the role of vibrations travelling through deeper sand layers. A behavioural experiment confirms that vibrational stimuli from prey insects on the surface of the sand stimulate the antlions buried in deeper sand layers to move towards the surface. Sand depth and particle size both have a strong effect on signal transmission. The damping coefficient (alpha(10)) varies from 0.49 dB to 3.30 dB cm(-1) and depends on frequency (in the range from 100 to 300 Hz), particle size (from finest to coarse sand) and distance from the source of the vibrations. The deeper the sand, the narrower the frequency range of the signal becomes. Sand is a filter for higher frequencies. The smaller the sand particles, the more intense the filtering becomes. Fine sand with a mean sand particle size of 360 mu m is a more efficient filter than coarse sand; consequently, high frequencies (> 2.5 kHz) are eliminated at a depth of 3 cm. Mean frequency depends on both depth and particle size. However, low frequency signals still propagate at a certain distance, which is biologically important in prey detection. Although the most efficient signal propagation appears to occur in coarse sand, it contains overly large particles that are inconvenient for relatively small antlion larvae. Predators seek a compromise between fine and coarse sand choosing medium sand.

AB Increased trade and travel have resulted in an increasing rate of introduction of biological organisms to new regions. Urban environments, such as cities, are hubs for human activities facilitating the introduction of alien species. Additionally, cities are susceptible to invading organisms as a result of the highly altered and transformed nature of these environments. Despite best efforts at prevention, new incursions of alien species will occur; therefore, prioritising incursion response efforts is essential. This study explores these ideas to identify priorities for strategic prevention planning in a South African city, Durban (eThek-wini), by combining data from alien species watch lists, environmental criteria, and the pathways which facilitate the introduction of alien species in the city. Three species (with known adverse impacts elsewhere in the world) were identified as highly likely to be introduced and established in Durban (Alternanthera philaveroides, Lithobates catesbeianus and Salennpsis invicta). These species are most likely to enter at either the Durban Harbour; pet and aquarium stores; or plant nurseries and garden centres - therefore active surveillance should target these sites as well as adjacent major river systems and infrastructure. We suggest that the integrated approach (species, pathways, and sites) demonstrated in this study will help prioritise resources to detect the most likely and damaging future incursions of alien species.

AB Agroecological landscapes, which promote critical features such as agrobiodiversity, represent valuable global commons. These landscapes are products of ways of life, local knowledge, and rural practices. Recent studies agree on the need to better understand such rooted social-ecological systems by more deeply exploring their human-environment relationships. To address this, we investigated agroecological landscapes in two communities, one in the Andean highlands of northwest Argentina, the other in the Dolomites in northern Italy. This research applies discourse-ethnographic methods to explore how the communities build institutions to protect their culture, how they manage change, and how the environment is perceived and used. Based on the results, we identified several dimensions of farmers' intangible values, their understanding of well-being, and how they contribute to the genesis of landscapes (maize terraces, alpine pastures). This work shows that many interviewees did not perceive nature merely as a resource or service for humans, as suggested by the widely held discourse of agricultural industrialization, and that alternative relationships to nature are possible and do exist in practice. Further, this work raises relevant issues for how to imagine the transition to agricultural systems that do not define well-being only from the perspective of materiality and of humans.

AB In areas of the Cerrado biome (Brazilian savanna) with well-defined rainy and dry seasons, changes in climate and landscape affect the abundance and seasonality of insects. Larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon brasiliensis (Navas) (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) are predators that build traps in dry sandy soil to capture prey. Here we determined the effect of rain on trap building by M. brasiliensis larvae in a riparian forest in the Cerrado biome. Differences in population size and developmental stage were found between the rainy and dry seasons. In the laboratory, the effect of rain-soaked soil on trap building was evaluated. Fewer antlion larvae were found in the rainy season. Moreover, a greater abundance of larvae in the final stage of development (third instar) was found in the dry season, whereas more first instars were found in the rainy season. The latter revealed that wet soil affects the trap building of the larvae, as smaller traps were built in the treatment with soaked soil (simulated rain), whereas the larvae in the control treatment (no rain) continued building traps with no change in size. The findings indicate that seasonality in the Cerrado biome exerts a short-term influence on M. brasiliensis larvae (larvae build fewer traps) as well as a long-term influence (association with life cycle).

AB Sea urchins produce high-energy, membrane-bound fecal pellets that contain residual nutrients and large quantities of microbiota. These egesta are readily consumed by the shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. Egesta of the sea urchin, Lytechinus variegatus, were evaluated as a feed supplement or total replacement for a commercial shrimp diet. Shrimp were stocked at 0.49 g +/- 0.06 g initial body weight and housed individually in 2.8-L tanks in a commercial recirculating zebrafish system. Shrimp were assigned to one of six diets: commercial shrimp feed, reference sea urchin feed, collected dried sea urchin egesta, collected wet sea urchin egesta, half ration of shrimp feed and half collected wet sea urchin egesta, and egesta naturally produced by two sea urchins in polyculture. Equivalent dry matter amounts of each diet were proffered to shrimp in each treatment twice daily, except for those that had complete access to natural egesta excreted by sea urchins in polyculture. Sea urchins were proffered a reference sea urchin feed at 2% body weight daily. After 27 days, shrimp proffered collected dried or wet egesta did not differ significantly in percent weight gain and showed the lowest weight gain. The percent weight gain of shrimp fed the commercial shrimp diet did not differ significantly from that of the shrimp fed half commercial shrimp diet and half egesta. The highest weight gain was recorded for those shrimp that consumed the untouched egesta produced by sea urchins in polyculture. These data suggest that consumed egesta have noteworthy nutritional value and therefore would be beneficial to the culture of extractive species in an integrated multitrophic aquaculture system.

AB Indigenous forests represent South Africa's smallest biome, yet they are critical spaces for aligning sustainable development goals with carbon mitigation activities and conservation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the productivity and biodiversity of coastal lowland forests in the Dwesa Cwebe nature reserve in the Eastern Cape Province and characterize how estimates differed among alternative allometric equations. Using a complete tree census across six plots in the reserve, a total of 1489 trees were inventoried in 2011 and again in 2016. Aboveground tree carbon averaged 99.8 Mg C ha(-1) (range 77.2-126.9 Mg C ha(-1)) using locally derived equations and 214.6 Mg C ha(-1) using generalized equations. Tree aboveground net primary productivity averaged 1041.8 g C m(-2) y(-1). Forty-eight tree species were identified, including many species important to the livelihoods of local communities for medicinal, ceremonial, and other provisioning services. Overall, this study shows that current conservation activities are concomitant with high tree productivity and high levels of C stocks and biodiversity, including species of local and regional significance. Sustaining forest productivity and biodiversity in the future will be critical for maintaining ecosystem services and enhancing stewardship of forest resources in the region.

AB Habitat degradation is a major concern in transformed landscapes, as it reduces complexity by removing species, interactions, and ultimately biodiversity. Degradation is also of concern for ecological networks (ENs) composed of an interconnected system of conservation corridors among South Africa's commercial forestry compartments. These corridors are predominantly grasslands, and used as rangeland, so managed to optimize grazing conditions. Yet, how this management approach influences biodiversity remains unknown. Here, we studied how butterfly assemblages respond to local differences in rangeland quality (low, high and reference sites), and how this effect compared to that of local environmental variables (e.g. rockiness and bare ground), meso environmental gradients (e.g. topographic position and aspect), and landscape composition (i.e. proportion of different land cover types in the surrounding matrix). We calculated species richness and composition, Shannon's diversity index (H'), and the Butterfly Conservation Index (BCIn) representing the proportion of sensitive and range-restricted butterfly species per site. Rangeland quality was considered less important for butterflies than other environmental variables, but it was also significantly confounded with other environmental variables. At the landscape scale, proportion of grassland in the landscape matrix influenced butterfly assemblage composition, while proportion of thicket had a significant positive effect on BCIn. Moreover, the effect of elevation on assemblage composition emphasizes the value of maintaining environmental gradients within these conservation corridors. At the meso spatial scale, butterfly species richness and diversity (H') declined with increased dominance by a single plant species, which usually occurs late in a normal fire cycle. This suggests a reliance by butterflies on recurring natural disturbances for long-term persistence. We recommend moderate patch burning and grazing, as well as occasional hot burns to reduce thicket in Afromontane grassland. This approach would improve local scale vegetation patterns, and increase heterogeneity across the landscape for conserving these butterflies into the future.

TI C-4 savanna grasses fail to maintain assimilation in drying soil under

AB C-4 photosynthesis evolved when grasses migrated out of contracting forests under a declining atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2](a)) and drying climate around 30 million years ago. C-4 grasses are hypothesised to benefit from improved plant-water relations in open habitats such as savannas, giving advantages over C-3 plants under low [CO2](a). But experimental evidence in a low CO2 environment is limited, and comparisons with C-3 trees are needed to understand savanna vegetation patterns. To test whether stomatal conductance (g(S)) and CO2 assimilation (A) are maintained in drier soil for C-4 grasses than C-3 trees, particularly under low [CO2](a), we investigated photosynthesis and plant-water relations of three C-3 tree and three C-4 grass species grown at 800, 400 or 200 ppm [CO2](a) over moderate wetting-drying cycles. C-4 grasses had a lower soil-to-leaf water potential gradient than C-3 trees, especially at 200 ppm [CO2](a), indicating reduced leaf water demand relative to supply. Yet the dependence of g(S) and A on predawn leaf water potential (a measure of soil water availability) was greater for the C-4 grasses than trees, particularly under low [CO2](a). Our findings establish that g(S) and A are not maintained in drier soil for C-4 grasses compared with C-3 trees, suggesting that this mechanism was not prevailing in the expansion of C-4-dominated grasslands under low [CO2](a). This inherent susceptibility to sudden decreases in soil water availability justifies why C-4 grasses have not evolved a resistant xylem allowing operation under drought, but instead shut down below a water potential threshold and rapidly recover. We point to this capacity to respond to transient water availability as a key overlooked driver of C-4 grass success under low [CO2](a). A is available for this article.

AB Permafrost is one of the key components of terrestrial ecosystem in cold regions. In the context of climate change, few studies have investigated resilience of social ecological system (SER) from the perspective of permafrost that restricts the hydrothermal condition of alpine grassland ecosystem. In this paper, based on the structural dynamics, we developed the numerical model for the SER in the permafrost regions of the source of Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics and sensitivity of the SER, and estimated the effect of permafrost change on the SER. The results indicate that: 1) the SER has an increasing trend, especially after 1997, which is the joint effect of precipitation, temperature, NPP and ecological conservation projects; 2) the SER shows the spatial feature of high in southeast and low in northwest, which is consistent with the variation trends of high southeast and low northwest for the precipitation, temperature and NPP, and low southeast and high northwest for the altitude; 3) the high sensitive regions of SER to the permafrost change have gradually transited from the island distribution to zonal and planar distribution since 1980, moreover, the sensitive degree has gradually reduced; relatively, the sensitivity has high value in the north and south, and low value in the south and east; 4) the thickness of permafrost active layer shows a highly negative correlation with the SER. The contribution rate of permafrost change to the SER is -4.3%, that is, once the thickness of permafrost active layer increases 1 unit, the SER would decrease 0.04 units.

AB The determinants of patterns of plant species composition on small mountains are poorly known, especially in Central Africa. We aimed here to identify variation in tree species composition throughout the Ngovayang Massif (southern Cameroon) and determine the relative contributions of environmental factors and spatial autocorrelation in shaping tree species composition. Vegetation surveys were conducted in fifteen 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) permanent plots established along a transect from lowland (200 m) to submontane forests (900 m) in which all trees with a diameter (dbh) >= 10 cm were inventoried. Data were investigated using ordination methods (Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis). At the local scale, the most important variable in determining tree species composition patterns was slope exposure, followed by distance from the ocean and altitude. Together, these environmental variables explained 28% of floristic variation among plots, and the spatial structure almost disappeared when the effects of these variables were removed. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that spatial variables (geographic coordinates of the plots) or geographic distance between plots explained only 1% of the total initial variance. Residual spatial variation not explained by the environmental variables probably reflects the history of vegetation and the effects of other climatic variables that were not included in this study. Floristic variation in the Ngovayang Massif is due to strong environmental heterogeneity. The sensitivity of floristic composition to environmental variables such as slope orientation and altitude suggests that tree species composition may shift with expected climate changes, such as changes in the movement of air masses, increase in mean annual temperatures or increasing severity of the dry season. Our study highlights the need for systematic on-the-ground measurements of climate variables in tropical montane areas in order to better understand the current climate regime and serve as a basis for modelling future changes.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the key landscape structures of migratory bird habitats that affect abundance of migratory birds to promote resilient coastal green infrastructure planning on the Yellow Sea coast. We classified coastal areas into four watersheds of South Korea and conducted multivariate regression analysis between migratory bird populations and landscape structures including total class area (CA), patch area distribution (MN), patch density (PD), and edge density (ED). At the national level, sandbank MN, sandbank CA, water ED, and grasslands were derived as key landscape structures affecting the abundance of migratory birds. At the watershed level, key landscape structures were determined as follows: Urban area_MN for the Han River watershed, rice paddy MN for the Asan watershed, rice paddy CA for Saemangeum, and grassland MN for the Youngsan River watershed. Considering the multifunctionality, redundancy, and connectivity of the resilience strategy, we provide specific coastal infrastructure planning recommendations at the national and watershed scales.

AB Clathrina aurea is a calcareous sponge with a wide distribution along the Eastern South American coast. Despite this wide distribution, larvae have never been observed in this species. In the present work, we investigated the population differentiation and dispersal capacity of this native species along the Southwestern Atlantic (South-Southeastern Brazil) using genetic data (microsatellites) and morphological comparison. Clathrina aurea presented high genetic diversity with a high number of alleles and high heterozygosity compared to other sponge species. On the other hand, our results showed inbreeding and significant population structure, although with some evidence of long-distance dispersal. The structuring pattern observed could be a result of the influence of the local marine landscape/environment and ocean currents in a stepping-stone model. The external morphology was conservative; however, spicule measurements were significantly different within and among localities, evidencing its high variability in the class Calcarea. This is the first population genetics study of a native calcareous sponge using microsatellites.

AB The Pantanal system is considered the largest wetland in the neotropics, harbouring lakes, wetlands and several permanent rivers or temporary channels. We evaluate changes in zooplankton taxa occurrence and density during low-water, flooding, high-water and draining conditions in the Paraguay River, which is the most important river of the Pantanal wetland, with the expectation that zooplankton were constrained by hydrological factors. The present study is one of the few addressing zooplankton in a floodplain river over four periods of the flood pulse in different years. We sampled 12 sites in the Upper Paraguay River along 75 Ian, and found 262 taxa with a dominance of rotifers, followed by cladocerans and testaceans. The variation in species composition is clearly related to the Paraguay River water level, supporting strongly the flood-pulse concept. The flood pulse influenced zooplankton groups in the river distinctively, increasing the zooplankton richness and abundance at high water. We have documented a small part of the existing dynamics of the lotic aquatic system throughout the flood pulse. The inventory of the potamoplankton indicates that numerous taxa are current travellers brought either from the upstream or from adjacent aquatic ecosystems in the lateral dimension of the floodplain.

AB The concept of an ecological threshold has spurred important advances in understanding the nonlinear responses of ecosystems to various disturbances. Yet integrated evaluations of an ecosystem's structural threshold and functional threshold are rare, and we know little about linkages between observed nonlinear changes in ecosystem structure along disturbance gradients and the associated changes in system feedbacks. We applied a two-step approach to perform integrated evaluations of structural and functional thresholds in a Mongolian shrub land. First, by using 6 years of data from plant communities along a gradient of grazing intensity, we identified the structural threshold in the changes in shrub cover along the gradient. We then identified the functional threshold at which wind erosion rates were accelerated due to sufficient decline in shrub cover. We found that shrub cover changed abruptly along the grazing gradient, indicating the presence of a structural threshold. Shrub cover decreased gradually along the grazing gradient to the threshold of 6.9%; thereafter it decreased rapidly. This level of shrub cover was close to that of the functional threshold (5.3%), namely the point at which the rate of wind erosion was accelerated. Our key finding is the coupling of structural and functional thresholds, suggesting that the modification of feedbacks between wind erosion and shrub cover might be associated with the nonlinear response of ecosystem structure to grazing. To bridge the gap between management applications and ecological threshold theory, it is essential to understand the potential feedback mechanisms that would contribute to nonlinear changes in ecosystem structure.

AB Productivity of herbivores depends on their success in attaining protein and fat stores above survival and reproductive thresholds. Populations in semi-arid regions depend on mobility to access resources that are spatiotemporally heterogeneous. The potentially isolated wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), gemsbok (Oryx gazelle) and springbok (Antidorcus marsupialis) populations in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) depend on high-quality grasslands, a limited and important vegetation type. We used microhistological analyses of dung samples from these ungulates to estimate their seasonal diet composition. Results showed that forage quality and availability drive wet season diet composition. Protein-rich short grasses on pans were important for all ungulates in the wet season. Wildebeest, gemsbok and springbok diets overlapped in the wet season. The favoured grasses were depleted during the dry season and the ungulates shifted their diet likely as an adaptive mechanism to maintain intake rates. Wildebeest fed on lower-quality grasses while springbok and gemsbok fed on dicotyledons when more preferred forage was scarce. Our findings demonstrate the importance of access to heterogeneity of vegetation types that provide high-quality resources in the wet season (saline pan grassland habitats) and dry season reserves of forage (woodland habitats).

AB The esophagus of the eucrustaceans is known as a short tube that connects the mouth with the stomach but has generally received little attention by the carcinologists, especially during the larval stages. By this reason, the present study is focused on the morphology and ultrastructure of the esophagus in the brachyuran Maja brachydactyla during the larval development and adult stage. The esophagus shows internally four longitudinal folds. The simple columnar epithelium is covered by a thick cuticle. The epithelial cells of the adults are intensively interdigitated and show abundant apical mitochondria and bundles of filamentous structures. The cuticle surface has microspines and mutually exclusive pores. Three muscle layers surrounded by the connective tissue are reported: circular muscles forming a broad continuous band, longitudinal muscle bundles adjacent to the circular muscles, and dilator muscles crossing the connective tissue vertically toward the epithelium. The connective tissue has rosette glands. The esophagus of the larvae have epithelial cells with big vesicles but poorly developed interdigitations and filamentous structures, the cuticle is formed by a procuticle without differentiated exocuticle and endocuticle, the connective layer is thin and the rosette glands are absent. The observed features can be explained by his role in the swallowing of the food.

AB The concept of resilience has in recent years been one of the more commonly used urban development concepts. In the social sciences, the term is understood as a dynamic process that reflects a relatively good adaptation, irrespective of the hazards or traumatic experiences. It is linked with the concepts of risk, vulnerability and positive adaptation. The concept of resilience as used in the social sciences has been adapted by other disciplines, including research on the city, where the term is ambiguously and sometimes inconsistently defined. The aim of this study is to explain the term resilience, its reference to the city and to clear up ambiguities of the terminology related to the two lines of research on resilience in relation to the city as presented by the relevant literature: city resilience and the resilient city. Analyses show that both these terms, despite their widespread application, are at present imprecisely defined in the relevant literature and generally speaking used interchangeably, which makes their precise application difficult. In addition, the assumption that city resilience can be treated as a process that leads to a desired state of the resilient city, has not been confirmed. The correctness of the application of the second of these concepts (the resilient city) raises doubts, because it will probably never be possible to develop a city not vulnerable or fully resistant to various types of development perturbations.

AB Azteca brevis Forel, a dolichoderine ant species, builds along the branches of its host plant galleries that bear numerous holes slightly wider than a worker's head. We noted that the workers hide, mandibles open, beneath different holes, waiting for arthropod prey to walk by or alight. They seize the extremities of these arthropods and pull backwards, immobilizing the prey, which is then spreadeagled and later carved up or pulled into a gallery before being carved up. The total duration of the capture ranges from a few minutes to several hours. This ambush group hunting permits the capture of insects of a wide range of sizes, with the largest being 48.71 times heavier than the workers, something that we compared with other cases of group hunting by ants and trap use by other arthropods. A convergence with myrmicine ants of the genus Allomerus is shown. Thus, this study also shows that the genus Azteca presents the largest panel of group hunting strategies by ants and that there is polyethism related to polymorphism, as hunting workers are larger than their nestmates. We concluded that these gallery-shaped traps correspond to the notion of 'extended phenotype'.

AB Much of the international commons literature reveals a decreased functioning of local traditional institutions that regulate natural resource harvesting. In South Africa, it is believed that the creation of new democratic structures at the end of Apartheid has contributed significantly to the deterioration in traditional resource regulation and this in turn has led to the extensive resource degradation seen in parts of the country. Many of these assertions, though, remain anecdotal in nature. Given the high reliance by rural households on natural resources, and the serious negative implications that over-use has on livelihood security, understanding how well or poorly such commons are regulated is key to ensuring the sustainability of such resource-dependent populations. The aim of this study was therefore to examine systems of resource governance, focusing specifically on firewood, and to determine the roles of traditional and democratically elected community leaders in six rural villages spanning two chieftaincies in Bushbuckridge, South Africa. In each study village, five local leaders were interviewed and five community focus groups were conducted. Results indicate that most parties still regard the Chief as the ultimate authority for regulating firewood harvesting. However, overall firewood management appears weak, at best, across the region. Although some authors attribute this to community confusion over the roles of local leaders in a new democracy, we provide evidence that other socio-political factors, including political expediency, may be driving the increasingly relaxed implementation of these firewood management systems. With resource dependence remaining a vital contributor to livelihood security across the developing world and with many rural communities facing increasing strain under local resource depletion, these findings shed new light on the complex social dynamics underlying the widely reported weakening of traditional institutions in South Africa. In so doing, it offers insights into local firewood governance that can be used to combat these challenges and thereby reduce regional social and ecological vulnerability being experienced in communal landscapes across the region.

AB Habitat loss, land-use transformation, climate change, and biological invasions all elevate the importance of plasticity in food selection for the continued persistence of dietary specialists. Horned lizards (Phrynosoma spp.) are myrmecophagic specialists and the abundance of ant prey make their populations vulnerable to habitat loss, as well as invasive ants and associated pest control programs. We studied ant use by Phrynosoma cornutum (Texas Horned Lizards) on an insular urban reserve in central Oklahoma that was bereft of harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.), presumed to be their chief prey. The five most commonly available ant genera based on bait station captures were Monomorium (69%), Forelius (11%), Pheidole (10%), Crematogaster (7%), and Tapinoma (2%). Based on the examination of 124 scat samples from adult and juvenile P. cornutum, Crematogaster (81%), Pheidole (12%), Formica (6%), and Monomorium (1%) were used as prey. Consumption of prey in several ant genera by P. cornutum disproportionately to their availability was related to ant mass and presumed nutritional value. Among juveniles, gape size did not influence Pheidole use but may influence Formica use. We suggest that P. cornutum are adaptive ant specialists whose populations might be maintained in habitat fragments without harvester ants as long as abundant medium-and large-sized native ant communities are present. Therefore, urban reserves, when effectively managed for native fauna, can conserve declining native species by serving as habitat havens in an otherwise unsuitable landscape.

AB Elevated pCO(2) threatens coral reefs through impaired calcification. However, the extent to which elevated pCO(2) affects the distribution of the pelagic larvae of scleractinian corals, and how this may be interpreted in the context of ocean acidification (OA), remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that elevated pCO(2) affects one aspect of the behavior (i.e., motility) of brooded larvae from Pocillopora damicornis in Okinawa (Japan), and used UV-transparent tubes that were 68-cm long (45 mm ID) to incubate larvae on a shallow fringing reef. Replicate tubes were filled with seawater at similar to 400 mu atm or similar to 1 ,000 mu atm pCO(2), stocked with 50 larvae each, and incubated vertically for 12 h with their midpoints at 0.3-m (shallow) or 3.3-m (deep) depth over a reef at 4-m depth. Larval behavior was assayed through their position in the tubes, which was scored in situ every 4 h beginning at 08:00 h. Lipid content was measured at the end of the experiment as a potential driver of behavior through its effects on larval buoyancy. Larval position in the tubes varied between depths and time of day at similar to 400 mu atm pCO(2) and similar to 1,000 mu atm pCO(2). At similar to 400 mu atm, larvae moved toward the top (0.1-m) of shallow tubes throughout the day, but in the deep tubes they aggregated at the bottom of the tubes from 08:00 to 20:00 h. In contrast, larvae incubated at similar to 1,000 mu atm pCO(2) aggregated at the bottom of shallow tubes at 08:00 and 20:00 h, however in the deep tubes they were found in the bottom throughout the day. As lipid content of the larvae declined 23-25% at similar to 1,000 vs. similar to 400 mu atm pCO(2), loss of lipid may be a cause of modified larval behavior at high pCO(2). If the pCO(2)-mediated changes in behavior and lipid content during this short experiment occur during longer exposures to high pCO(2), our results suggest OA could alter the dispersal capacity of brooded coral larvae.

AB The generation of plant diversity involves complex interactions between geography, environment and organismal traits. Many macroevolutionary processes and emergent patterns have been identified in different plant groups through the study of spatial data, but rarely in the context of a large radiation of tropical herbaceous angiosperms. A powerful system for testing interrelated biogeographical hypotheses is provided by the terrestrial bromeliads, a Neotropical group of extensive ecological diversity and importance. In this investigation, distributional data for 564 species of terrestrial bromeliads were used to estimate variation in the position and width of species-level hydrological habitat occupancy and test six core hypotheses linking geography, environment and organismal traits. Taxonomic groups and functional types differed in hydrological habitat occupancy, modulated by convergent and divergent trait evolution, and with contrasting interactions with precipitation abundance and seasonality. Plant traits in the Bromeliaceae are intimately associated with bioclimatic differentiation, which is in turn strongly associated with variation in geographical range size and species richness. These results emphasize the ecological relevance of structural-functional innovation in a major plant radiation.

   NDM/VNDM approach
SO PLOS ONE

AB Aim
   A database based on distributional records of Eurasian Zephyrus hairstreaks (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Theclini) was compiled to analyse their areas of endemism (AoEs), species richness and distribution patterns, to explore their locations of past glacial refugia and dispersal routes.
   Methods
   Over 2000 Zephyrus hairstreaks occurrences are analysed using the NDM/VNDM algorithm, for the recognition of AoEs. Species richness was calculated by using the option 'Number of different classes' to count the different classes of a variable presented in each 3.0 degrees x 3.0 degrees grid cell, and GIS software was used to visualize distribution patterns of endemic species.
   Results
   Centres of species richness of Zephyrus hairstreaks are situated in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (EQTP), Hengduan Mountain Region (HDMR) and the Qinling Mountain Region (QLMR). Latitudinal gradients in species richness show normal distribution with the peak between 25 degrees N and 35 degrees N in the temperate zone, gradually decreasing towards the poles. Moreover, most parts of central and southern China, especially the area of QLMR-EQTP-HDMR, were identified as AoEs that may have played a significant role as refugia during Quaternary global cooling. There are four major distributional patterns of Zephyrus hairstreaks in Eurasia: Sino-Japanese, Sino-Himalayan, high-mountain and a combined distribution covering all three patterns.
   Conclusions
   Zephyrus hairstreaks probably originated at least 23-24 Myr ago in E. Asia between 25 degrees N to 35 degrees N in the temperate zone. Cenozoic orogenies caused rapid speciation of this tribe and extrusion of the Indochina block resulted in vicariance between the Sino-Japanese and the Sino-Himalayan patterns. The four distribution patterns provided two possible dispersal directions: Sino-Japanese dispersal and Sino-Himalayan dispersal.

AB As the primary land use in the Karoo, extensive small-stock farming contributes significantly towards the agricultural economy of the region. However, the sustainability of this practice has been questioned for many years. This led to the establishment of a long-term stocking-density trial in 1988 at the Carnarvon Research Station. The trial was designed on a three-camp rotational grazing system under four stocking densities (8, 7, 5.5 and 4 ha SSU-1). Following continuous treatment over 28 years, the results from a once-off assessment in February 2016 portrayed no significant differences between treatments with regard to plant height, cover, species diversity, ecological and grazing index scores. Animal production varied among treatments where the mean production per hectare was found to be the highest under the high stocking-density treatment. Due to the absence of historical data, the results from this study are not conclusive with regards to changes in the vegetation dynamics over time and therefore does not lend itself to making conclusions concerning stocking densities. It can, however, be concluded that the vegetation of the Western Upper Karoo is remarkably resilient to the perceived higher stocking densities set at the time, on condition that an appropriate grazing management strategy is applied.

AB We demonstrated a possible future wherein coral reefs shift to an algae-dominated state that retains low coral cover and a functional biomass of herbivorous fishes that sustains a reef fish fishery. We evaluate the effect of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) and increased coastal nutrients under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate scenarios for years 2000-2100, which are implemented as coral bleaching events. Coral mortality from bleaching events drove a lagged increase in herbivorous fish populations via a shift from coral-dominated to algae-dominated habitats. Biomass and catch of piscivorous fish declined significantly, with the fishery shifting to the harvest of herbivorous fish. No-take MPAs for 20% of reef areas represented a threshold that had a positive effect on herbivorous fishes but no influence on the steep declines of corals and piscivorous fishes. Contemporary no-take MPAs protect less than 1% of coral reef areas around the Hawaiian Islands; substantial management action would be required to approach the 20% area threshold.

This species was first introduced over 200 years ago to the east coast of North America, and once established has maintained a relatively consistent spread rate against the dominant current. We used a stage-structured, integro- difference equation model that couples a demographic matrix for population growth and dispersal kernels for spread of individuals within a season. The kernel describing larval dispersal, the main dispersive stage, was mechanistically modeled to include both drift and settlement rate components. It was parameterized using a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the Gulf of St Lawrence, which enabled us to incorporate larval behavior, namely vertical swimming. Dispersal heterogeneity was modeled at two temporal scales: within the larval period (months) and over the adult lifespan (years). The kernel models variation within the larval period. To model the variation among years, we allowed the kernel parameters to vary by year. Results indicated that when dispersal parameters vary with time, knowledge of the time-averaged dispersal process is insufficient for determining the upstream spread rate of the population. Rather upstream spread is possible over a number of years when incorporating the yearly variation, even when there are only a few "good years" featured by some upstream dispersal among many "bad years" featured by only downstream dispersal. Accounting for annual variations in dispersal in population models is important to enhance understanding of spatial dynamics and population spread rates. Our developed model also provides a good platform to link the modeling of larval behavior and demography to large-scale hydrodynamic models.

AB Recent evidence suggests that morphological divergence of the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) occurred in Greater Antilles under conditions of prolonged isolation and hybridization with the Cuban crocodile (C. rhombifer). We investigated morphological diversity in C. acutus in the coastal zone of the Yucatan Peninsula, where isolation and hybridization have also been reported. We compared the relationships among various morphological traits between insular and coastal populations. Our results suggest morphological diversity in the region, which is possibly related to population isolation and mechanical constraints imposed by differences in diet. A broad-snouted morphotype appears typical of island populations. Hybridization could also cause morphological variation, but its importance in this case remains to be confirmed. Sexual dimorphism of the American crocodile in the region appears to be less pronounced than for other crocodilians. We also provide population-specific size estimation models for two populations (Banco Chinchorro and Cozumel) to improve future monitoring.

AB Tree diversity in West Africa is threatened by intensified land uses and salinization, and farmers' role in conservation of tree species is unclear. We hypothesized that farmers contribute to conservation of tree diversity through protection of trees in their agroforestry landscapes and compared the diversity and structure of the tree vegetation across landscape classes. Inventories were carried out in three villages in the Groundnut Basin in Senegal, assessing tree diversity, density and crown cover. Tree diversity as assessed by species accumulation curves was high in forests, but cultivated landscapes had comparable or almost comparable diversity, especially in the cases where the forest was planted or was affected by charcoal production. However, the occurrence of exotic species was higher in cultivated parts of the landscape, and although many species were in common, ordination plots indicated that forests and cultivated landscapes to some degree had different species composition. Salinity had a strong influence on vegetation, not only in the tans (salt marshes) but also across the other landscape classes. In conclusion, agroforestry landscapes in the three villages harbor considerable tree diversity, but insufficient to fully conserve the tree species. We argue that informing and including farmers in tree management in the region will contribute to overall conservation of tree genetic resources.

AB Several studies have identified the tendency for species to share interacting partners as a key property to the functioning and stability of ecological networks. However, assessing this pattern has proved challenging in several regards, such as finding proper metrics to assess node overlap (sharing), and using robust null modeling to disentangle significance from randomness. Here, we bring attention to an additional, largely neglected challenge in assessing species' tendency to share interacting partners. In particular, we discuss and illustrate with two different case studies how identifying the set of permitted interactions for a given species (i.e. interactions that are not impeded, e.g. by lack of functional trait compatibility) is paramount to understand the ecological and co-evolutionary processes at the basis of node overlap and segregation patterns.

AB The causes of the worldwide problem of encroachment of woody plants into grassy vegetation are elusive. The effects of soil nutrients on competition between herbaceous and woody plants in various landscapes are particularly poorly understood. A long-term experiment of 60 plots in a South African savanna, comprising annual applications of ammonium sulphate (146 +/- 1166 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and superphosphate (233 +/- 466 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) over three decades, and subsequent passive protection over another three decades, during which indigenous trees encroached on different plots to extremely variable degrees, provided an opportunity to investigate relationships between soil properties and woody encroachment. All topsoils were analysed for pH, acidity, EC, water-dispersible clay, Na, Mg, K, Ca, P, S, C, N, NH4, NO3, B, Mn, Cu and Zn. Applications of ammonium sulphate (AS), but not superphosphate (SP), greatly constrained tree abundance relative to control plots. Differences between control plots and plots that had received maximal AS application were particularly marked (16.3 +/- 5.7 versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 trees per plot). Soil properties most affected by AS applications included pH (H2O) (control to maximal AS application: 6.4 +/- 0.1 to 5.1 +/- 0.2), pH (KCl) (5.5 +/- 0.2 to 4.0 +/- 0.1), acidity (0.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.3 cmol kg(-1)), acid saturation (8 +/- 2 to 40 +/- 5%), Mg (386 +/- 25 to 143 +/- 15 mg kg(-1)), Ca (1022 +/- 180 to 322 +/- 14 mg kg(-1)), Mn (314 +/- 11 to 118 +/- 9 mg kg(-1)), Cu (3.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (6.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 mg kg(-1)). Magnesium, B, Mn and Cu were identified using principal component analysis, boundary line analysis and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests as the nutrients most likely to be affecting tree abundance. The ratio Mn/Cu was most related to tree abundance across the experiment, supporting the hypothesis that competition between herbaceous and woody plants depends on the availability of anabolic relative to catabolic nutrients. These findings, based on more than six decades of experimentation, may have global significance for the theoretical understanding of changes in vegetation structure and thus the practical control of invasive woody plants.

SO KOEDOE

ID LARGE CARNIVORES; ECOLOGY; HYAENAS; ROADS
AB The brown hyaena (Parahyaena brunnea) is endemic to southern Africa. The largest population of this near-threatened species occurs in Botswana, but limited data were available to assess distribution and density. Our objectives were to use a stratified approach to collate available data and to collect more data to assess brown hyaena distribution and density across land uses in Botswana. We conducted surveys using track counts, camera traps and questionnaires and collated our results and available data to estimate the brown hyaena population based on the stratification of Botswana for large carnivores. Brown hyaenas occur over 533 050 km(2) (92%) of Botswana. Our density estimates ranged from 0 brown hyaenas/100 km(2) in strata of northern Botswana to 2.94 (2.16-3.71) brown hyaenas/100 km(2) in the southern stratum of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. We made assumptions regarding densities in strata that lacked data, using the best references available. We estimated the brown hyaena population in Botswana as 4642 (3133-5993) animals, with 6.8% of the population in the Northern Conservation Zone, 73.1% in the Southern Conservation Zone, 2.0% in the smaller conservation zones and 18.1% in the agricultural zones. The similar densities of brown hyaenas in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve and the Ghanzi farms highlight the potential of agricultural areas in Botswana to conserve this species. The conservation of brown hyaenas in the agricultural landscape of Botswana is critical for the long-term conservation of the species; these areas provide important links between populations in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
   Conservation implications: Botswana contains the core of the brown hyaena population in southern Africa, and conflict mitigation on agricultural land is crucial to maintaining connectivity among the range countries.

AB Suspended solids (SS) resulting from sediment resuspension (SR) can impact ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on freshwater organisms and their interactions. This study was conducted to determine whether the SS can affect the interaction between filter-feeding fish (Aristichthys nobilis) and zooplankton using a mesocosm experiment with sediments from Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China. SR using pump was divided into three intensities: strong, weak and no SR representing different concentrations of SS. Zooplankton abundance was significantly higher in the no-fish treatments than in the fish treatments under all three SR conditions. SR intensity had significantly negative effect on zooplankton abundance. There were interactions between fish and SR intensity on abundances of copepod, rotifer, total zooplankton and dominant zooplankton species except cladoceran abundance. The results indicate that SS had a lesser effect on zooplankton predation by filter-feeding fish, which suggests that zooplankton communities in shallow lakes can be affected by the filter-feeding fish even under high level of SS condition.

AB Epigeal termites alter ecosystem-level processes through foraging and mound building. These effects are proportional to density. Whilst much is known about the factors influencing mound density in natural settings, how termites respond to livestock grazing has been overlooked. We compared the characteristics and density of Trinervitermes trinervoides (Isoptera: Termitidae) mounds in the Karoo (South Africa) within an exclosure and continuously-grazed plot from a > 75-year grazing experiment. Specifically, we asked whether long-term livestock grazing impacted (1) termite mound density, volume, basal area and size, (2) mound occupancy and age, (3) vegetation characteristics and (4) soil properties. Long-term grazing increased mound density two-fold. This was coupled with a decrease in mean mound size, an increase in the size of the largest mounds and range of mound sizes, and an increase in the proportion and numbers of young, active mounds. However, these changes did not alter landscape-scale mound basal area or volume. Vegetation was unaffected by long-term grazing but it did cause soil phosphorus, magnesium and calcium depletion. We suggest that livestock grazing provides additional forage resources for termites through litter breakup and dung production, leading to greater mound recruitment and thus densities, whilst allowing mounds to achieve greater maximum size.

AB Plant invasions are threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes that have far reaching ecological and economic impacts. Understanding the mechanisms of invasion essentially helps in developing effective management strategies. Rubber bush (Calotropis procera) is an introduced milkweed that invades Australian beef production rangelands. Its establishment is often associated with disturbances caused by pastoral management practices. We examined whether or not rubber bush (1) outcompetes native grasses, (2) can invade intact rangeland, and (3) if disturbance facilitates rubber bush establishment and spread in grassy rangelands. We measured the competitive response of different densities of Mitchell grass (Astrebla pectinata) individuals and the competitive effects of associate rubber bush seedlings in an additive common garden experiment. Replicated field exclosure experiments, under grass-dominated and tropical savanna woodland conditions examined the effect of increasing levels of disturbance on rubber bush seedling emergence. The dominant native Mitchell grass was a stronger competitor than rubber bush when grown together under greenhouse conditions, whereby root and shoot biomass yields were more restricted in rubber bush compared with Mitchell grass. This finding was corroborated in the field exclosure experiments at both sites, where seedling emergence increased 5-fold in seeded and highly disturbed plots where superficial soils were turned over by treatments simulating heavy grazing and trampling by cattle or machinery. Emergence of rubber bush seedlings in seeded plots that were undisturbed, clipped and grazed was minimal and rubber bush seedlings did not survive the seedling stage in these plots. These results demonstrate that disturbance to the superficial soil stratum affects the ability of rubber bush seeds to successfully establish in a microsite, and high levels of soil disturbance substantially increase establishment. Thus, rubber bush is a poor competitor of Mitchell grass and does not invade intact grassland. Consequently, rubber bush invasion is disturbance-dependent in the vast Australian rangelands. The spread of this weed may be arrested by management practices that minimise disturbances to grass cover.

AB Alternate attractors have been shown to exist in a variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems, e.g. temperate forests, savannas, shallow lakes, wetlands, coral reefs, kelp forests. The shift from one attractor to another, also referred to as a regime shift, is thought to occur when a system passes some critical threshold such that the trajectory of the system changes direction. Alternate attractors in population dynamics can also exist, leading to alternate stable states in the population abundance of a species. This study explored alternate attractors in the population dynamics of the Indo-Pacific sea urchin Diadema savignyi and the potential underlying mechanisms that promote its bi-stability. In Moorea, French Polynesia, the local abundance of D. savignyi, a functionally important herbivore in lagoon habitats, occurs in two states: (i) solitary individuals that occupy crevices in low densities and (ii) aggregations of tens to hundreds of individuals. These different states are temporally stable and are not explained by spatial differences in recruitment rates of juveniles. A field experiment revealed that the per capita mortality rate of adult D. savignyi was substantially lower at sites where urchins occurred in aggregations compared with sites at which they were solitary individuals. An additional experiment showed that per capita mortality decreased with increasing aggregation size. Individuals in high-density aggregations, however, had significantly smaller test diameters than solitary individuals, indicating that individuals in aggregations may be food limited. Collectively, the evidence suggests that the two different local abundance states of D. savignyi result from negative feedback loops where high local density can be maintained by aggregative behavior that greatly reduces per capita risk of predation when the local number of adult sea urchins is sufficiently large; sites with few sea urchins remain at low density because individuals are more susceptible to predation when crevices are occupied but there are not enough individuals to form large aggregations. Thus, there may be alternate attractors in the population dynamics of D. savignyi that can produce either persistently low or high local population densities.

AB Termites have a large influence on ecosystem functioning. Understanding what drives termite activity patterns improves understanding of nutrient cycling, productivity, and heterogeneity in savannas. We present a mechanistic framework that relates the interactive effects of rainfall, grassland structure, large herbivore presence, and soil factors to termite activity. To test this framework, we used grass litterbags to monitor termite activity at ten sites across Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We assessed the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on termite activity at two scales: the large (landscape) scale, variation in bait removal among 300 m(2) plots that were distributed across the park and at the small (within-plot) scale (1-300 m(2)). Half of our sites were located inside large herbivore exclosures to test for the effect of mammalian herbivore presence. At the landscape scale, termite grass removal declined towards higher rainfall and in the presence of mammalian herbivores. Removal did not depend on soil factors. At the small scale, removal declined with increasing grass height, particularly in the 1 m surrounding the bait bag. Resource quality did not affect bait removal. We suggest that competition for forage drives the negative effect of mammalian herbivores on termites, whereas lower bait removal in taller swards may be due to direct negative effects from rainfall, fire and/or competition with free-living microbes. Ultimately, we suggest that the impact of termites on nutrient cycling is most pronounced when abiotic (rainfall) and biotic conditions (mammalian herbivory) limit grass removal by fire and decomposition by free-living microbes.

AB Livestock herding is a widespread practice in the mountains of Nepal, and grazing in the forest and pastures within protected areas is a main source of cattle fodder. Given the implications of grazing on biodiversity conservation and the need for sustainable management of pastures in the Manaslu Conservation Area of Nepal, we assessed grazing intensity along an elevational gradient following the Budhi Gandaki valley. The data set consisted of grazing intensities recorded every 250 m along a transect from 1400 to 5200 m above sea level and farmer interviews, after an initial satellite data analysis. Grazing and herd size were found to increase with increasing elevation, reflecting local livelihood dependency on cattle herding. Species richness was then analyzed along a grazing disturbance gradient at 7 goths (summer cattle shed) in heavily grazed areas. Disturbance was found to be moderate at intermediate distances, where species richness was found to be higher; the results agree with the generally accepted intermediate-disturbance hypothesis. The plant species not affected, even at the locations with highest grazing, were unpalatable species. These results can be useful in decision making related to management of forests and pastures in the Manaslu Conservation Area as well as in Himalayan forests and grasslands in general.

AB This study is aimed at collection of all available phytosociological data on vegetation of Sinai Peninsula, a region that is still poorly explored. An overview of the plant communities of Sinai is compiled based on additional field work and inventories. The database for Sinai vegetation will serve as a nucleus for the National Vegetation Databank of Egypt-'VegEgypt'. Aspects like species richness, species turnover, conservation categories, and endemism were given special attention. The database was set up and analysed using the Turboveg and Juice programs. A matrix of 816 relev,s and 496 species belonging to 69 families and 281 genera formed the basis for further analysis. Asteraceae, Poaceae and Fabaceae were the most represented families. The lists contain 52 threatened, 16 endemic and 20 sub-endemic species. The percentage of endemic species is highest in insular floras, peninsulas and mountain chains. The vegetation analysis resulted in 21 associations. The plant associations on sand habitats have the lowest species richness and species turnover because of water scarcity. On the other hand, plant communities or associations inhabiting rocky habitats have the highest species richness and species turnover.

AB The Sargassum beds in Gamak Bay, Korea, have deteriorated over recent decades. We conducted numerical experiments to assess the applicability of artificial reefs and longlines for seaweed forest restoration in terms of propagule dispersal. We applied hydrodynamic (Environment Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC)), wave (Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)), and particle tracking models for tidal currents, wave-induced currents, and the dispersal of the propagules, respectively. The major factors for propagule dispersal such as forcing, settling velocity w (s) , and release height were included, and the results of the models were analyzed using dispersal kernel, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests, and survival rate based on bed elevation. The dispersal distance kernel was fitted to Gaussian and polynomial functions and showed higher wave impacts, whereby the mean dispersal distance was simulated 6.3 m under pure tide and increased by 14 times under the combined tide and wave condition. Propagules were found to hit the bottom intensively during a low-to-flood phase, while wave forcing enhanced vertical dispersal and hindered the intensive sinking. A two-dimensional dispersal location kernel showed that dispersal distance increased with high release heights and its direction faced the shoreline due to shallow water depth and strong wave-induced currents. ANOVA tests regarding the mean distance indicated that w (s) , forcing, release heights, and the combined effect of forcing and w (s) contributed 49.5, 20.5, 5.4, and 22.9 %, respectively, yielding a total of 72 % from w (s) . Adjusting the release height to extend dispersal distances led to A, C, and B locational effects, in order from lowest to highest, while survival rates were 67, 70, and 83 % for A, B, and C, respectively. From the results, we concluded that C is the most suitable locational type for restoration.

AB Vegetation dieback can alter plant population dynamics and community structure, however, its impact on litter decomposition has been poorly understood. The litterbag method was employed to examine effects of reed dieback on litter decomposition of native Phragmites australis in the Spartina alterniflora-invaded Chinese salt marshes. Compared with healthy Phragmites, the initial C and N contents in leaf, sheath and stem of dieback Phragmites were significantly higher (for all P < 0.001, except N content in stem P>0.05) and their initial C:N ratios were significantly lower (P<0.05). Moreover, the aerial stem litter of dieback Phragmites decomposed significantly faster than that of healthy Phragmites (F-1,F-46 = 5.784; P < 0.05). During the 310-day decomposition, the C:N ratio in dieback Phragmites was significantly lower than that in healthy Phragmites (F-1,F-273 = 28.510, P < 0.001) and the remaining N concentrations of the two types of Phragmites were significantly different from each other (F-1,F-270 = 16.316,P < 0.001). Only the N content in leaf tissue of dieback Phragmites decreased continuously, while it changed up and down in other tissues. Our results suggest the significance of integrating vegetation dieback into the ecosystem processes and the vegetation and land-surface models, as well as the management strategies on protecting the susceptible ecosystems.

AB Allometric scaling law predicts that herbivores respond differently to the availability of resources, mediated by body size. However, studies of allometric responses have often focused on animals with a relatively large difference in body size. Here, using a correlative field study, habitat use by two herbivorous species, the Bean Goose (Anser fabalis) and the Greater White-fronted Goose (A. albifrons), with a relatively small difference in body size was investigated during the wintering period. Both a generalized linear mixed model and a mixed logistic regression model showed that both species selected lower lying areas that were recently exposed, and, as expected, the smaller Greater White-fronted Goose showed a stronger selection of foraging habitat than the larger Bean Goose. Sward height also influenced habitat selection by both species, and the smaller species selected shorter swards than the larger species. In terms of forage quality, both models failed to detect a significant effect of nitrogen content on goose habitat selection. A logistic regression model showed that structural heterogeneity of the sward negatively correlated with the patch selection of the smaller species, but for the larger species such a correlation was not found. In agreement with our hypotheses, our results provide some preliminary indication that coexistence of the two goose species studied here might be mediated by an allometric response even if the difference in body size is relatively small.

AB Variation in body size, behavior, feeding habits and habitat use patterns in medium-and large-sized mammals influence the adequacy of sampling methods to register presence and abundance. Moreover, even if methods are similarly adequate, different methodologies result in distinct cost-efficiency relationships (i.e. some may have reduced costs, be less time-consuming and/or require less-skilled technicians). Focusing on three different sampling methods commonly used to monitor medium and large mammals in seasonal tropical forests, we compared the species richness detected by each method and quantified their cost-efficiencies: (1) camera traps; (2) line transects for direct observations of animals; and (3) line transects seeking tracks/footprints. We simultaneously monitored medium and large mammals along five trails between July and August 2009 and January and February 2010, in the Serra do Japi Biological Reserve, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Data from two distinct seasons demonstrated that significantly higher species richness was achieved by using signs of presence and direct observations detected in transects. Camera traps recorded the fewest species, but represented the lowest cost per species. Direct observations and searches for tracks/footprints required a greater number of field technicians (with more skill and experience) to record the focal species and therefore have a higher cost, but allowed twice as many species to be recorded compared to camera traps. The choice of sampling methodology depends on the study objective, mammal species targeted and/or amount of resources available. We advocate use of camera traps for long-term studies and in conjunction with the other two methods to improve identification accuracy, allow individual identification and permit more accurate abundance estimates.

AB The vast majority of research on alternative food networks (AFNs), such as farmer's markets (FMs) and farm shares, examines the social and economic aspects of these networks with relatively little consideration of the ecology of AFNs despite frequent claims of environmental sustainability and beneficence. This is especially true at scales beyond that of the farm or field and in modes of production that fall outside the bounds of the organic/conventional paradigm. This article seeks to address these lacunae and construct a framework for exploring the ecology of AFN landscapes through the review and synthesis of scholarship in landscape ecology and related fields. This framework is then applied to a case study of the Greenmarket FMs in New York City, USA, to highlight the challenges of assessing the ecology of AFNs and the opportunities this research offers for improving the sustainability of AFNs.

AB Woody vegetation assessments were conducted in the burned and unburned paddocks of Tiisa Kalahari Ranch in western Botswana to determine the influence of opportunistic burning on woody species density, cover and structure in semiarid rangelands. Burning was conducted by farm management twice in one paddock in October 2005 and 2006, and once in another paddock in October 2011 to control bush encroachment. Sampling was conducted in May 2012 using 50 by 2 m transects (16 at the 2011 burn site and 18 at the 2005/2006 burn site) as paired comparisons in both burned and unburned paddocks. Tree height was 0.27 m (28%) and 0.23 m (21%) lower (P < 0.05) in burned paddocks at the 2011 and 2005/2006 burn sites, respectively. There was an increase in the proportion of saplings and a decrease in tall woody plants in burned areas at all sites (P < 0.001). At the 2011 burn site, height and cover of Catophractes alexandri were 63% (P = 0.041) and 67% (P = 0.035) lower in burned paddocks, respectively. Density of Acacia mellifera was 53% (P = 0.031) lower, with more multi-stemmed (>20 stems) plants in burned paddocks (P = 0.02). Grewia flava density was 59% higher in burned paddocks (P = 0.038). At the 2005/2006 burn site both height and density of Acacia hebeclada were significantly higher in burned paddocks (65%, P = 0.045 and 56%, P = 0.037, respectively). Tarchonanthus camphoratus was only present at this site, where its height, density and cover were significantly lower in burned paddocks (P < 0.05). Overall, tree height was shorter in burned than unburned paddocks, with C. alexandri contributing the most to the height reduction. Follow up browsing by goats on the coppice growth after burning may prevent C. alexandri, a dominant encroaching species from recruiting and spreading.

AB South Africa has a rapidly developing abalone aquaculture industry based largely on the cultivation of Haliotis midae. The prophylactic use of probiotic microorganisms has been shown to enhance the health, growth and nutritional status of a variety of cultured aquaculture species. Furthermore, research has shown that H. midae fed a high protein artificial diet supplemented with the proteolytic marine bacterium Vibrio midae SY9 have enhanced digestive protease activity levels, protein digestion and absorption, and growth. The predominant V. midae SY9 extracellular alkaline protease, VmproA, has been previously shown to be present in the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of H. midae fed a diet supplemented with V. midae SY9. Therefore, VmproA may be responsible for the probiotic properties of the bacterium in farmed abalone. In this study, the role of VmproA on abalone growth was investigated using the mutant strain V. midae SY9Mut2, which is unable to produce VmproA. Over the course of a 180 day laboratory-based growth trial the growth rate of small ( 28 mm) abalone improved by 6.5 and 14.5% following dietary supplementation with V. midae SY9 and V. midae SY9Mut2, respectively, in comparison to abalone fed a basal diet. In situ protease activity within the H. midae digestive tract was significantly increased in animals fed the V. midae SY9 supplemented diet compared to abalone fed either the basal feed or the V. midae SY9Mut2 supplemented diet. Thus, VmproA does not appear to be the factor responsible for increased growth of probiotic-supplemented abalone.
   Statement of relevance: The manuscript addresses the mechanism of how probiotics function in a farmed abalone species. This is important since probiotic supplementation of feed is proving successful in increasing the growth of these molluscs, and yet very little is known regarding the underlying relationship between the host animal and the probiont.

AB Fire is a key ecosystem driver in savannahs and it can have large impacts on species distribution and density. A re-examination of fire management in Kruger National Park is currently under review with the objective to maintain natural ecosystem dynamics and favour tourists' ability to observe animals. We used data on location, intensity and frequency of fires and census data on three species considered as rare and of conservation concern in the park, tsessebe, roan and sable antelope to estimate the relationship between fire occurrence and species occurrence and density. We also investigated the impacts of different environmental predictors on antelope populations. The model predictors that most affected the density and presence of antelopes were mean fire return period, the type of geological substrate and the presence of water-points. We then used our models to evaluate different fire management scenarios and make recommendations for an optimal fire management strategy for the conservation of these rare antelopes. We also tested our scenarios under different precipitation conditions, in order to investigate the likely response of species to climate change. Roan antelope is the most sensitive species to climatic variations, while sable seems to be the most resilient. The approach described here can also be used to improve the conservation of locally rare species in other regions and habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying the genes underlying rapid evolutionary changes, describing their function and ascertaining the environmental pressures that determine fitness are the central elements needed for understanding of evolutionary processes and phenotypic changes that improve the fitness of populations. It has been hypothesized that rapid adaptive changes in new environments may contribute to the rapid spread and success of invasive plants and animals. As yet, studies of adaptation during invasion are scarce, as is knowledge of the genes underlying adaptation, especially in multiple replicated invasions. Here, we quantified how genotype frequencies change during invasions, resulting in rapid evolution of naturalized populations. We used six fully replicated common garden experiments in Brazil where Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) was introduced at the same time, in the same numbers, from the same seed sources, and has formed naturalized populations expanding outward from the plantations. We used a combination of nonparametric, population genetics and multivariate statistics to detect changes in genotype frequencies along each of the six naturalization gradients and their association with climate as well as shifts in allele frequencies compared to the source populations. Results show 25 genes with significant shifts in genotype frequencies. Six genes had shifts in more than one population. Climate explained 25% of the variation in the groups of genes under selection across all locations, but specific genes under strong selection during invasions did not show climate-related convergence. In conclusion, we detected rapid evolutionary changes during invasive range expansions, but the particular gene-level patterns of evolution may be population specific.

AB The complexity of the natural processes lead to many nonlinear interacting factors that influence the distribution and survival of marine pelagic species, particularly in their larval phase. The management of these ecosystems requires techniques that unveil those interactions by studying the system globally, including all relevant variables and combining both community and environmental data in a single step. Specifically, we apply an unsupervised neural network, the Self-Organising Map (SOM), to a combined dataset of environmental and decapod larvae community data from the Balearic sea, obtained in two years with contrasting environmental scenarios, as an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) technique that provides a global and more detailed view of both the environmental processes and their influence on the distribution of such planktonic community.
   We examine the parental influence on the initial larval distribution by aggregating data by adult habitat, which also increments the signal to noise ratio (mean data patterns over noise due to outliers or measurement errors), and consider the distribution of larvae by development stage (as a proxy of age and hence of potential dispersion). The joined study of parental effect, drifting or concentration events determined by dynamical processes in the whole water column, and lifespan, draws the possible paths followed by larvae, and highlights the more influencing variables in their distribution. Investigation of the different aspects of dynamic height (absolute values, gradients or edges and correlations) clarified the effect of the oceanographic processes on decapods' larvae.

AB Bischofia javanica is a non-native tree species in Japan's Ogasawara Islands, where it threatens native tree species due to its rapid propagation and growth. An effective method is needed to limit the expansion of B. javanica populations and to conserve the natural forest ecosystem of the islands. For this purpose, we examined the effectiveness of a new application technique for the herbicide glyphosate on B. javanica. In this method, glyphosate solution is directly injected into holes drilled in the stem, and each hole is then plugged with a cork stopper to prevent loss of the solution, namely the drill-and-plug method. We also developed an allometric regression model linking stem diameter with total aboveground biomass (AGB) to estimate the necessary herbicide dosage. Our results suggest that between 0.1 and 0.5 g kg(-1) (active ingredient per unit AGB) is required to control most B. javanica trees. Verification of the drill-and-plug method using the minimum dosage (0.1 g kg(-1)) showed that most of the herbicide-treated trees were killed. These results suggest that the drill-and-plug method can help control the B. javanica invasion of the Ogasawara Islands.

AB Three decades after its population collapse, the sea urchin Diadema antillarum has yet to return to pre-mortality densities in most Caribbean localities. Circumstantial evidence suggests high post-settlement mortality due to predation as a potential mechanism to explain the lack of, or the slow recovery of this sea urchin. In this study we experimentally reduced the densities of two reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Halichoeres bivittatus, at one site for one year and measured the effect of their removal in the abundances and size structures of D. antillarum in relation to that of a comparable control site. We hypothesized a significant increase in urchin abundance and a reduction in mean test diameter at the experimental site with respect to the control site after the reduction in fish abundance. Overall, the density of D. antillarum did not vary significantly between control and experimental sites for the different census periods. Fish removal had a significant effect on the size structure of D. antillarum and in the mean density of the medium size classes. Results suggest that removal of these two labrids can significantly increase the relative abundance of medium-sized sea urchins and modify its population structure. Efforts to recover D. antillarum populations would be strengthened if densities of T. bifasciatum and H. bivittatus remain low.

AB Context. The pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) is an endangered species in Argentina. Scarce information exists about one of the four last populations that survive in Corrientes province, where direct counts estimated a population of <500 individuals.
   Aims. To evaluate the status of the pampas deer population in Corrientes by applying a standardised methodology and to develop methodological recommendations for future deer monitoring.
   Methods. We conducted six population censuses between 2007 and 2010, using line transects placed on roads throughout 1200 km(2) of grasslands in the Aguapey region, Corrientes, Argentina. From a moving vehicle, we counted every pampas deer group observed along transects. We used Distance 6.0 and its multiple-covariate distance sampling engine to estimate deer density, while exploring the potential effect of roads, habitat type, hour, season, observer experience and survey effort on deer occurrence and density estimation.
   Key results. The occurrence of pampas deer was irrespective of transect location (minor or major road) but a greater number of animals was detected over transects in minor roads and in areas covered by grasslands with young pine plantations. We estimated a density of 1.17 individuals km(-2) (s.e.=0.52), and habitat type was the most important covariate for density estimation. We estimated a total population of 1495 deer (95% CI=951-2351, CV=23.27%) for the Aguapey region in Argentina.
   Conclusions. Corrientes hosts one of the largest populations of pampas deer in Argentina, with similar to 1000 individuals. The fact that we estimated a larger population than did previous studies could be explained either by actual population growth during the past 10 years, or by the use of more exhaustive and sophisticated sampling design and data analysis.
   Implications. Population surveys using covariate distance sampling on ground line transects can provide more realistic population estimates than do other simpler methods. Our population estimates and methods can be used as a baseline for future monitoring of this population, as long as factors such as sampling effort, type of roads for locating transects, and habitat type are considered in future analysis.

AB Spatial variation is a ubiquitous feature of natural ecosystems, especially in arid regions, and is often present at various scales in these regions. To determine the scale dependence of the heterogeneity of soil chemical properties and the dominant scales (factors) for soil heterogeneity in arid regions, the spatial variability of soil resources was investigated in the Gurbantunggut Desert of Central Asia at the scales of 10(-3), 10(-2), 10(-1), 10(0), 10(1), 10(2), 10(3) and 10(4) m (from individual plant to population or community to ecosystem). Soil chemical properties including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus were considered in the investigation. At a scale of 10(-1) m, which represented the scale of individual plant, significant enrichment of soil resources occurred under shrub canopy and "fertile islands" formed in the desert ecosystem. Soil EC exhibited the largest heterogeneity at this scale, indicating that individual plants exerted a great influence on soil salinity/alkalinity. Soil nutrients exhibited the greatest heterogeneity at a scale of 10(2) m, which represented the scale of sand dune/interdune lowlands (between communities). The main important factors contributing to soil spatial heterogeneity in the Gurbantunggut Desert were individual plants and different topographic characteristics, namely, the appearance of vegetation, especially shrubs or small trees, and existing sand dunes. Soil salinity/alkalinity and soil nutrient status behaved differently in spatial heterogeneity, with an inverse distribution between them at the individual scale.

AB This paper represents the first attempt to study the microfungal flora contained in the digestive system of the most widespread aquatic invasive invertebrate in the world: Procambarus clarkii (Cambaridae, Decapoda). Understanding its bioinvasion, in terms of ecological risk and environmental impact, requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers consequences on all levels, from macroscopic to microscopic. In this study, we investigated both the population dynamics and the dietary habits of the red swamp crayfish captured within a natural biotope in Northern Italy. The diet was mainly based on plant detritus. The analysis of microfungal flora in the crayfish stomach revealed a fairly constant composition, unrelated to season and diet. Since most of the fungi were associated with detritus and some species were particularly frequent, we formulate the hypothesis that the fungi may be selected to decompose plant material in the digestive tract, thus providing a source of energy to the crayfish. Procambarus clarkii is also shown to be a potential vector of plant diseases as some of the 45 isolated fungal taxa are potentially phytopathogenic.

AB To gain additional knowledge and better understand forest soil management on a small scale, geostatistical analytical tools were employed to examine the spatial distribution in dry aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) and other selected soil properties and to assess the possible relationships between MWD and other soil properties. Selected properties of forest soils collected along a 300-m transact in the Nimbia Forest Reserve of Nigeria exhibited moderate to high variability in distribution with sodium ion displaying the greatest variability [coefficient of variation (CV, 91.2%)] and principal component analysis revealed the exchange complex cluster as influencing total variation of field soil properties. The autocorrelation function showed significant spatial correlation from 1 lag in soil organic carbon up to 17 lags (51 m) in soil moisture content (.). The spherical and Gaussian semivariogram models described the spatial structure of most soil properties; however, for clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil organic carbon (SOC), an exponential model analyzed their spatial dependence.

AB Although it is widely recognized that introduced plant species produce organic matter of different quality surprisingly little is known about how this influence the community structure of decomposers. Here, we investigated the effects of a commercial non-native tree species, lodgepole pine, on the community structure of wood-decaying basidiomycetes and the decomposition of deadwood in northern Sweden. We allowed an assemblage of wood-decaying fungi that occur naturally on pine to interact on fresh wooddiscs of lodgepole pine and Scots pine, using microcosms. At the end of the experiment we measured the wood mass loss and calculated the area of the different species' domains as indicated by interaction zone lines between competing species. Fungal assemblage structure developed in a markedly different way on lodgepole pine compared to Scots pine. In addition to there being fewer species in the final fungal assemblage on lodgepole pine, fungal functional composition was different. White-rot fungi were more competitive and dominated on lodgepole pine, while brown-rot fungi dominated on Scots pine. We also found that the decay rate of lodgepole pine wood was slightly lower, although the underlying reason remains unclear. However, there was a significant positive relationship between the abundance of white-rot fungi and the wood mass loss of lodgepole pine, while no relationship was found between fungal functional group and the decay rate of Scots pine. We also found no relationship between species richness and wood decay rates. Our study reveals that a non-native tree species used in commercial forestry can alter the structure and functional composition of a saprotrophic wood-decaying fungal assemblage. Future studies are required to clarify the mechanisms behind the observed patterns and whether they apply to natural systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are being implemented for various conservation and fishery management objectives. Well-designed ecological monitoring programs should accompany the implementation of NTMRs to assess their performance against stated objectives. However, monitoring programs often have limited funding and limited access to experienced (expert) underwater visual census (UVC) observers. Consequently, use of non-expert, volunteer observers to collect marine ecological data has increased. The need to assess the quality and utility of non-expert data has been acknowledged. Few studies have directly compared expert and non-expert assessments, and these are generally one-point-in-time comparisons. Here we assess the magnitude of NTMR:Non-reserve density ratios for target and non-target reef fish collected in five separate years over a decade (2000-2009) by expert and non-expert observers in the Palm Islands, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Despite variations in methods and resultant differences in absolute fish density estimates, NTMR:Non-reserve density ratio estimates made by experts and non-experts usually differed by 10% or less. Furthermore, estimates of the statistical significance of reserve effects made by experts and non-experts had at least 80% agreement over the decade. The findings support the notion that UVC data collected by trained non-expert observers can provide reliable information on the magnitude of NTMR effects.

AB Polygyny is common in social insects despite inevitable decreases in nestmate relatedness and reductions to the inclusive fitness returns for cooperating non-reproductive individuals. We studied the prevalence and mode of polygyny in the African acacia-ant Crematogaster mimosae. These ants compete intensively with neighboring colonies of conspecifics and with three sympatric ant species for resources associated with the whistling-thorn acacias in which they all obligately nest. We used the genotypes of alate males at ten microsatellite loci to reconstruct queen genotypes and found that C. mimosae colonies are frequently secondarily polygynous, in that they include multiple closely related (and sometimes full-sib) queens, and (more rarely) unrelated queens. We also found that individual queens in both monogynous and polygynous colonies had mated with multiple males, making C. mimosae an interesting example of simultaneous polygyny and polyandry. The presence of polygyny in C. mimosae and the intense competition for nest-sites between C. mimosae and its conspecifics support the association between nest-site limitation and polygyny. Polygyny may allow for increased worker populations and a competitive advantage, as inter-colony conflicts are typically won by the colony with the larger number of workers.

AB We conducted a high-spatial resolution, monthly sampling survey from July 07 to September 08 at a coastal site in Cudillero, Central Cantabrian Coast, to describe the seasonality and cross shore trends in abundance of meroplanktonic larvae. larval seasonality was driven by the most common meroplanktonic taxa during the stratification period, the barnacle Verruca stroemia and the veligers of the bivalve Hiatella sp. and littorinids. Across the shelf, distributions differed between species and stages. At least for V. stroemia cyprids, the abundance trends correlate negatively with Ekman transport, suggesting advection to the flow below the thermocline. These relationships were only significant when integrated over periods of several weeks, suggesting that transport effects accumulate during the larval duration. For other abundant taxa, the lack of fit to wind induced currents and the high larval concentrations in very coastal waters may reflect retention mediated by active swimming behaviour throughout the water column.

TI Effects of the number of people on efficient capture and sample

AB Certain carnivore research projects and approaches depend on successful capture of individuals of interest. The number of people present at a capture site may determine success of a capture. In this study 36 lion capture cases in the Kruger National Park were used to evaluate whether the number of people present at a capture site influenced lion response rates and whether the number of people at a sampling site influenced the time it took to process the collected samples. The analyses suggest that when nine or fewer people were present, lions appeared faster at a call-up locality compared with when there were more than nine people. The number of people, however, did not influence the time it took to process the lions. It is proposed that efficient lion capturing should spatially separate capture and processing sites and minimise the number of people at a capture site.

AB Maintaining a sustainable egg bank through rapid maturation and the production of large clutches is an important strategy for large branchiopods surviving in ephemeral habitats, and such egg banks can only be replenished by the recruitment of hatched eggs as a function of fitness (F). The ability to reach a threshold F represents a key adaptation to selection pressures. We investigated daily changes in the population density/size and hatching numbers of fairy shrimp. Branchinella kugenumaensis, and estimated their F values in an ephemeral pool, Siangtian Pond, in northern Taiwan during 2005, and four cohorts were observed. The number of hatchings per cohort ranged from 1.97 x 10(7) to 5.54 x 10(7), representing a hatching density between 1.42 and 2.83 nauplius.L-1, and the number of newly produced eggs per cohort ranged from 2.47 x 10(7) to 1.19 x 10(8), representing a high level of recruitment, ranging from 10,631 to 37,425 eggs.m(-2) in the sediment, which yielded a mean fitness of 2.05 produced eggs per hatching (CI = 1.82 similar to 2.35). The threshold F for replenishing the hatched portion of the egg bank was derived theoretically and ranges from 1.39 to 2.36, varying with the probability of reproduction failure and the rate of egg mortality. Because only a small fraction of the egg bank hatches during each inundation episode, the observed F may not be sufficient for replenishing the remaining egg bank. Therefore, additional strategies for long-term persistence are required, which may be achieved by exhibiting occasional indeterminate growth in addition to the regular determinate growth pattern of this species.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the population size of common leopard (Panthera pardus) in Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve in Selangor, Malaysia. Long term survival of leopard population in this area is threatened due to small size of the forest, isolation and presence of various disturbances in the habitat. However, no estimates are available on the number of leopard in the study area. We used unsupervised classification of pugmarks that allows clustering of the data sets based on their inherent similarities. Study was conducted during February to November 2008. Linear measurements of front and hind tracks and strides (n = 124) were classified using hierarchical cluster and discriminant analysis which indicated that at least four individuals of leopard were present in the study area of 1,411 ha. Despite the small size of the forest, the area is still rich in both fauna and flora. The leopard being the predator, has an important role in maintaining the health of the ecosystem. Therefore, the population size of the leopard could be used as indicator of sustainable conservation and management of the species in the area.

ID DISEASES
AB The roles of the international standard-setting bodies that are mandated to facilitate safe trade, such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organization, are well documented, as are the roles of the international organisations responsible for global health issues: the OIE, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However, developments in international trade, such as accelerating globalisation and the frequent emergence and re-emergence of diseases affecting both humans and animals, have brought new challenges and the need to reconsider the future roles of such organisations. New participants and new demands have also emerged to challenge these mandates, leading to potential areas of conflict. The need for countries to establish themselves as new trade partners, or to strengthen their positions while still maintaining safe trade, poses a challenge to standard-setting organisations, which must meet these demands while still remaining sensitive to the needs of developing countries. In this paper, the author describes and discusses some of these challenges and suggests how international organisations could evolve to confront such issues.

AB Most of the known food webs are based on organic compounds provided by photoautotrophic organisms. The terrestrial ecosystem of Malpelo Island (Colombia) seems to be an exception, however, since it supports several trophic guilds without hosting an adequate amount of primary producers. It has been suggested that this apparent paradox might be explained by external inputs provided by seabirds, namely Nazca Boobies (Sula granti), forming a huge colony on Malpelo. This hypothesis has never been tested. Here, we present a first approach to quantify the significance of Nazca Booby inputs into the Malpelo ecosystem via excrement, second eggs/chicks (which are prone to die), and carcasses, respectively, during the major breeding season. The total input was calculated to amount to 171.6 t per breeding season, with excrements accounting for almost 99% (170 t) of this input. Second eggs/chicks contributed approximately 1.1 t (0.64%) and carcasses around 0.1 t (0.06%). These finding support the idea of the Nazca Booby facilitating a food chain that pairs the pelagic primary producers of the open ocean with the terrestrial consumers of an island. Species most strongly profiting from this process include three endemic lizard species (Anolis agassizi, Diploglossus millepunctatus, Phyllodactylus transversalis) and the land crab (Johngarthia malpilensis).

AB Little is known of the interactive effects of. re and grazing on cryptogam species and assemblages. These effects were observed for bryophyte and lichen species in Tasmanian tussock grassland and hummock sedgeland several months after experimental burning and fencing. A factorial design was used on 40 randomly located and treated pairs of 1m x 1m quadrats in each of the vegetation types. In total, 24 cryptogam taxa were found, with grassland having a greater taxon richness, as well as higher total cryptogam cover and a different species composition, to the hummock sedgeland. There was greater cryptogam cover in the burned quadrats than the unburned quadrats in the grassland. However, only bryophytes had different species composition between burned and unburned quadrats. There was a small but signicant difference in richness in hummock sedgeland, with burned being richer than unburned. Three species were more abundant in the burned than in the unburned treatments in the grassland, whereas no species responded to treatment in the sedgeland and no species responded to grazing. The fact that no species or assemblage of species was significantly reduced in cover by the burns testifies to a high degree of cryptogam resilience to this disturbance. The total lack of negative grazing effects suggests cryptogams are not a major source of sustenance for the local vertebrate herbivores. These conclusions differ from those made elsewhere in the world.

AB Benthic marine invertebrates may form metapopulations connected via propagule dispersal. Conservation efforts often target potential source coastlines to indirectly benefit areas depending on allochthonous offspring production. Besides population density, adult size structure, sex ratio, brooding frequency and the proportion of breeding individuals may significantly influence the reproductive output of benthic populations, but these effects have seldom been tested. We used rocky shore crabs to assess the spatial variability of such parameters at relevant scales for conservation purposes and to test their consistency over 2 consecutive years; we then used the data to address whether bottom-up processes or biological interactions might explain the patterns observed. We decomposed egg production rates into their components for the 2 most abundant brachyuran species inhabiting the intertidal rocky habitat. Adult density and brooding frequency varied consistently among shores for both species and largely explained the overall spatial trends of egg production. Temporally consistent patterns also included among-shore differences in the size of ovigerous females of the grapsid Pachygrapsus transversus and between-bay differences in the fecundity of the spider crab Epialtus brasiliensis. Sex ratio was remarkably constant in both. We found no positive or negative correlations between adult density and brooding frequency to support either the existence of a component Allee effect (lack of mate encounters) or an effect of intra-specific competition. Likewise, shore-specific potential growth in P. transversus does not negatively correlate with frequency of ovigerous individuals, as would be expected under a critical balance between these 2 processes. The patterns observed suggest that bottom-up drivers may best explain spatial trends in the reproductive output of these species.

AB The population dynamics of the palatable, perennial grasses Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C.E.Hubb. (desert Mitchell grass), Chrysopogon fallax S.T.Blake (golden beard grass) and Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. (black speargrass), were studied in an extensive grazing study conducted in a eucalypt woodland within the Aristida-Bothriochloa pasture community in central Queensland between 1994 and 2000. Treatments were three grazing pressures based on light, medium and heavy utilisation of forage available at the end of summer and two timber treatments (trees intact and trees killed). Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was generally favourable for plant growth with no severe drought periods. Grazing pressure had a greater overall impact on plant dynamics than timber treatment, which had minimal impact. Grazing pressure had a large impact on H. contortus dynamics, an intermediate impact on B. ewartiana and no impact on C. fallax. Fluctuations in plant density of both B. ewartiana and C. fallax were small because both species were long lived with low levels of seedling recruitment and plant death, whereas fluctuations in H. contortus density were relatively high because of its relatively short life span and higher levels of both recruitment and death. Heavy grazing pressure increased the recruitment of B. ewartiana and H. contortus in some years but had no impact on that of C. fallax. Heavy grazing pressure reduced the survival of the original plants of both B. ewartiana and H. contortus but not of C. fallax. For H. contortus, the size of the original plants was larger where trees were killed than where trees were left intact and plants of the 1995 seedling cohort were larger in 1998 at heavy compared with those at light and medium grazing pressure. Grazing had a minor negative impact on the soil seed bank of H. contortus. Populations of all three species remained stable throughout this study, although the favourable seasonal rainfall experienced and the short duration of this study relative to the life span of these species may have masked longer term, deleterious impacts of heavy grazing pressure.

AB This study monitored the phenology of fruit and leaf of 575 chimpanzee food trees (40 species belonging to fifteen families) in the Budongo Forest Reserve (Uganda) from June 1999 to June 2006. We also monitored the phenology of all fig species in the study area. Fruit quantity varied significantly between species and seasons, with peak during wet season (April-June). The number of tree species in fruit correlated positively with rainfall and was higher during rainy season than dry season. Ficus species had exceptionally high fruit quantities ranging from 400 to 650,000 fruits per tree in a single production period. Leaf flushing peaked during late dry season and early wet season (February-April). Mature leaves were available at all seasons, even when young leaves were emerging. Only Ficus sur, Broussonetia papyrifera and Celtis gomphophylla had fruits throughout the year, and six species did not produce fruits during the study period. Of the twelve species that fruited between 40 and 58 months, three are very important timber species and seven were once killed with arboricides. We conclude that the long-term survival of chimpanzees in tropical forests requires conservation of their food trees.

AB We studied the response of Brachionus patulus to different concentrations of the heavy metal Pb in the presence and absence of sediments. We conducted acute ( LC50) and chronic ( life table demography and population growth) toxicity tests using sediment levels of 0, 30 and 280 mg l(-1) (= 0, 17 and 170 NTU) and Pb at 0, 0.06 and 0.6 mg l(-1). Experiments were conducted at 20 +/- 1 degrees C on a horizontal shaker and algal food ( Chlorella vulgaris) was added at a density of 1.0 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). The median lethal concentration ( LC50 +/- 95% Confidence intervals) of PbCl2 for B. patulus was 6.15 +/- 1.08 mg l(-1). Age- specific survivorship and fecundity curves showed increase in turbidity level resulted in decreased survival and offspring production of the rotifers. Increase in Pb concentration too had a negative effect on the survival and reproductive output of B. patulus. Statistically, average lifespan, life expectancy at birth, gross and net reproductive rates and the rate of population increase were all significantly influenced by the concentration of Pb, turbidity level as well as the interaction of Pb concentration x turbidity level. Rotifers exposed to 170 NTU did not grow regardless of the heavy metal concentration in the medium. Similarly, B. patulus exposed to 0.6 mg l(-1) Pb did not survive beyond 10 days regardless of the turbidity level in the medium. The rate of population increase of B. patulus derived from the growth experiments was negative in all treatments containing Pb as low as 0.06 mg l(-1) or turbidity level as low as 17 NTU. In treatments containing Pb or sediments, there existed no relation between the egg ratio and the population density.

AB The amount of space used by an organism is energetically determined. We utilized a population of ant lion larvae in Costa Rica to test allometric theories concerning the use of space by organisms and how different densities of individuals affect the use of space. The area of ant lion trapping pits scaled with mass to the three-quarters power, supporting allometric theory for sessile organisms. Our analyses also show that larger ant lion larvae show spatial repulsion and facultative density dependent pit-building strategies.

AB We investigated resting stage densities of two cladocerans, Daphnia obtusa and Moina macrocopa, in very small and ephemeral water bodies (temperate zone rain puddles) and tested whether these species exhibit a prolonged diapause in such an environment. Densities of ephippia as well as resting eggs in puddles ranged between 10(2) and 10(4) per m(2), and varied substantially within as well as among puddles. We determined the hatching success and temporal dynamics for resting stages collected from natural habitats and incubated at 15 degrees C with a 14L:10D light regime. Hatching success of both species was high (> 80%) and steady, with new hatchlings appearing mostly within 3-8 days. M. macrocopa hatched significantly faster and slightly more successfully than D. obtusa. Decapsulation of D. obtusa ephippia had no effect on the hatching success but slowed down the hatching dynamics. Hatching of egg pairs from the same ephippium was mostly synchronised - in only less than 10% of cases one egg hatched and the other remained potentially viable for the next flooding event. We compare our results with available data on cladoceran resting egg densities and hatching success, and discuss the possible causes of the high and steady hatching proportion of puddle cladocerans. A physiologically-based bet-hedging strategy may not be necessary if only a certain proportion of eggs are exposed to hatching cues or when the hydroperiod of temporary waters is longer than the cladoceran life cycle. Additionally, frequent destruction of localities may promote instantaneous termination of diapause even in ephemeral habitats such as puddles.

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; TROPICAL AFRICA; SOUTHERN-AFRICA; PRIORITIES
AB Species richness, endemism and areas that are rich in both species and endemic species were assessed and mapped for Namibia. High species diversity corresponds with zones where species overlap. These are particularly obvious where there are altitudinal variations and in high-lying areas. The endemic flora of Namibia is rich and diverse. An estimated 16% of the total plant species in Namibia are endemic to the country. Endemics are in a wide variety of families and sixteen genera are endemic. Factors that increase the likelihood of endemism are mountains, hot deserts, diversity of substrates and microclimates. The distribution of plants endemic to Namibia was arranged in three different ways. Firstly, based on a grid count with the phytogeographic value of the species being equal, overall endernism was mapped. Secondly, range restricted plant species were mapped individually and those with congruent distribution patterns were combined. Thirdly, localities that are important for very range-restricted species were identified. The resulting maps of endernism and diversity were compared and found to correspond in many localities. When overall endernism is compared with overall diversity, rich localities may consist of endemic species with wide ranges. The other methods identify important localities with their own distinctive complement of species.

AB In the intertidal limpet Patelloida pygmaea, two distinctive morphs, the forms pygmaea and conulus, have been recorded. The former possesses a flat elongated shell, and the latter has an extremely high round shell. It has been observed in the field that pygmaea is found on oyster shells Crassostrea gigas. The form conulus uses an unusual substrate for attachment. It is found on the living shells of the intertidal gastropod Batillaria cumingi. Although conulus is normally found only on shells of Batillaria, it can also be found on oyster shells when pygmaea and Batillaria shells are not present in nature. An electrophoretic analysis of allozymes showed that these two forms are reproductively isolated from each other and coexist without gene exchange on the same mudflat. Laboratory experiments showed that pygmaea prefers oyster shells and conulus prefers Batillaria shells as substrates for attachment when both oyster and Batillaria shells are present. The form pygmaea did not attach to Batillaria shells, even when only Batillaria shells were available. However, conulus also attached to oyster shells when Batillaria shells were not available. The proportion of individuals of conulus that attached to oyster shells decreased significantly when pygmaea was attaching to the oyster shells. These results suggest that pygmaea is ecologically more specialized to living on oyster shells than conulus.

   PATTERNS; ENDEMISM; SHEPPARDIA; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY
AB A re-appraisal of published knowledge of the birds recorded in Katanga (Democratic Republic of Congo) focussed on the status of 56 taxa, to reveal a high endemism (14 species of a total of at least 642). In addition, 33 taxa were also revealed as possible south-central African endemics but need thorough taxonomic appraisal. All are geographically isolated populations, with ranges restricted within, or centred on, Katanga. These taxonomic enigmas await thorough re-appraisal. The majority of these newly-recognised Katanga endemics were traditionally lumped into polytypic species in classifications based on the Biological Species Concept (BSC). These synonymised taxa have therefore been ignored repeatedly in recent conservation assessments of African birds. This failure illustrates how the BSC can obfuscate patterns of species diversity in its classifications, which lump evolutionarily-distinct lineages into imprecisely-diagnosed taxa. An unfortunate historical legacy is to forget that a distinct population exists, after it has been classified as a subspecies, synonym or race in a polytypic species. These discoveries exemplify the research opportunities that Katanga's birds present for avian systematists. The assessment of any taxon of Afrotropical birds is hamstrung by the fragmented state of taxonomic information in the literature. This constraint impinges on any taxonomic study of any African avifauna and will be removed if an accessible database summarises all published taxonomic information in an exhaustive classification, accounting for synonomy, authority and context of each described taxon. Availability of such a complete taxonomic catalogue is quintessential if phylogeographic and systematic research is to determine precisely which populations have been named, and where these occur. This is critical to compile refined biogeographical knowledge for scientifically-sound conservation plans and actions. Objective evaluation of the endemism of the Katanga avifauna requires complementary datasets for other regional avifaunas across Africa. Their unavailability exemplifies the gravity of this taxonomic impediment, given the immense effort involved in compiling and comparing such fine-grained taxonomic data. Deficiencies aside, the data compiled in this review point to a recent suite of speciation events (most likely late Cenozoic) centred on Katanga. The strident biogeographical signal in these data emphasises the hitherto poorly-appreciated significance of Katanga's unique and rich biodiversity, which ranks alongside better-known sites in Africa of global conservation importance.

AB The composition and abundance of distinctive planktonic autotrophs ( ca 60 taxa) were examined at roughly fortnightly intervals in two sizeable reservoirs ( Midmar and Albert Falls) on the uMngeni River, KwaZulu- Natal, between 1989 and 1997. The dynamics of community structure and abundance were examined in both taxonomic and functional ( C- S- R) terms in relation to physical abiotic variables ( thermal stratification, light climate, water level) and biotic influences of predation (zooplankton abundance).
   Annual periodicity was exhibited by most taxa apart from Cryptomonas, although patterns tended to be indistinct and inter-annual repeatability was generally weak - in line with year-to- year and between-system environmental variability. Water level fluctuation, with concomitant change in stratification intensity and hydraulic mixing and accompanying changes in water clarity associated with suspended sediment levels was clearly a major ( direct and indirect) determinant of phytoplankton composition and abundance. The influence of top-down controls as inferred from phytoplankton- zooplankton relationships was fundamentally different in the two reservoirs - potentially stimulatory in Midmar, but clearly regulatory in Albert Falls, where episodic collapses of Daphnia populations resulted in chlorophyll values well into the eutrophic level range. In addition to annual patterns, changes in chlorophyll content implied progressive long-term changes in trophic status, especially in Albert Falls, with the emergence of various 'new' taxa (and/ or higher peak densities of others).
   Consideration of phytoplankton dynamics in terms of functional groups offers certain advantages over conventional phyletic taxonomic analyses, although algal response forecasting by either approach appears potentially constrained by hydrological variability. Site-specific bio-monitoring, possibly using new rapid technologies, is likely to be necessary for ongoing management purposes until predictive capabilities under regionally characteristic conditions improve. Despite limitations, functional classification proffers faster advances to this end than conventional taxonomic appraisal.

AB This paper describes the classification and ordination of Sonoran Desert vegetation using systematically collected data from the US Army Yuma Proving Ground (USYPG). Two classifications were created, one based upon relative plant cover derived from 100 m line transect data and one based upon relative plant density derived from 6 m x 100 m belt transect data, with the belt transect being a lateral extension of the line transect. Both cluster analysis using Ward's Method and TWINSPAN were used for classifying the data while Principal Component Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, Detrended Correspondence Analysis, and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling were used as ordination methods. Cluster analysis was superior to TWINSPAN in creating logical classifications comparable to published descriptions of vegetation communities found in the Lower Colorado Subdivision of the Sonoran Desert. Together, the ordination methods served to accentuate different aspects of the data including main gradients of species composition, in particular a gradient separating plots with riparian-affinities from the main data set, a Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa gradient, and a gradient separating Encelia farinosa from the main data set. The main difference between the relative cover and relative density classifications was that the former under-represented cacti such as Opuntia bigelovii and the latter under-represented such as Parkinsonia microphylla and Olneya tesota. The classification methodology used in this study is useful for evaluating resource sampling strategies on U.S. Army bases in sparsely vegetated areas and the classifications could be used as a baseline for monitoring changes in vegetation communities.

AB Araceae is one of the largest herb families in tropical America, but its patterns of diversity and endemism are poorly known. We used predictive distribution modelling in GIS to study Araceae richness on a landscape scale in Ecuador. Modelling was based on georeferenced herbarium collections with humidity and mean annual temperature as climatic variables. Variation partitioning using multiple regression showed that humidity and altitude were main factors in explaining Araceae diversity patterns. Endemism was less well explained by present climatic factors. Unlike common diversity patterns of herbs or epiphytes, Araceae richness was highest in the eastern ( Amazon) lowland rain forest with a secondary centre on the Andean foothills of northwestern Ecuador. The peak in endemism was on the western slopes of the Andes, corresponding to areas that have been severely affected by human activities and deforestation. Eastern lowland ( Amazonian) forests were poor in endemic Araceae.

AB 1. Temporary ponds are inhabited by a variety of invertebrates, of which anostracans are an important group. We studied the lifetables of male and female anostracan Streptocephalus mackini at 3 algal concentrations (0.5 x 10(6), 1.0 x 10(6) and 1.5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)).
   2. Regardless of sex, S. mackini showed better survivorship at lower food levels. The longest average lifespan observed was 85 +/- 2 days for males fed Chlorella at 0.5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1).
   3. Both net reproductive rate and generation time decreased with increasing food level. The highest net reproductive rate was about 120 cysts per female. The longest generation time of about 40 days, observed at 0.5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1), was more than three times that at 1.5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1).
   4. The rate of population increase (r) was nearly the same (0.31 +/- 0.06) at high (1.5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)) and intermediate (1.0 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)) food levels. The r-value at low food level (0.5 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) of Chlorella) was 0.20 +/- 0.01 per day.

AB In a hectare of cerrado in the municipality of Botucatu, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, individuals in flower and/or fruit were counted for 26 thick-stemmed woody species (stem-circumference of 10 cm or more at the height of 30 cm above ground) during 12 months, at intervals of 14 days, from April 1973 to March 1974. Although rainfall of the cerrado region is seasonal, the phenological events seem to be not well correlated with this seasonality, whether examined on the species level nor on the individual level. No doubt, the main flowering period was October and the first half of November, which is at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season, whereas during February, March, and April less flowering occurred. But across the year of the study, at least some individuals were on every census date in flower. The main fruiting period was during the rainy season, in the second half of December and first half of January. In total 53% of the individuals flowered, and of these, 72% produced ripe fruits. The majority of species have an annual flowering pattern. Duration of flowering, which was defined as the timespan between the flowering of the first individual of a species and the end of flowering of the last individual, was different for the species. Also the newer duration of the single individuals within one species was different. Extremely long-flowering seems to be characteristic of many thick-stemmed woody cerrado species. The long flower duration of a species may be achieved by long-flowering of the single individuals and also by low synchrony of flowering within the individuals of a species. Referring to the total of the species, duration of flowering of a species is not correlated with total number of its individuals, but the two species with the highest number of individuals also had the most of individuals with flowers and fruits. Within a species tall individuals flowered more frequently. The number of species and the number of individuals in flower (for each observation date) show also only moderate correlation. On a few observation dates the relationship was even reversed. During the dry season the few flowering species had the same number of individuals in flower as the many species at the beginning of the rainy season. Throughout the year, at ail survey dates. one species dominated in terms of number of individuals flowering and the same was true for fruiting. In several species flowering stage and ripe fruiting stage overlapped, and the same was true for individual plants of Styrax ferruginea. The study also shows that phenological surveys of a complete census of a representative area give different insights into the phenological behavior of a community and its species than surveys based on selected individuals of selected species.

AB Patterns of genetic and morphological variation among eight populations of Patella barbara along the coast of South Africa were examined to see whether reported differences in shell morphology and behaviour between the west and east coasts were mirrored by other morphological and/or genetic differences. Morphological analyses of radular structure, gut-loop coiling and sperm microstructure revealed no differences between the populations. Discriminant functions analysis based on shell morphometrics showed major overlap between populations and failed to separate them. Electrophoretic analysis of 17 enzyme loci have an overall genetic identity (Nei) value of 0.995, a value which lies within the generally accepted range for conspecific populations. In two of the populations, at Dwesa and Arniston, individuals were found to be 'gardening' algal resources. At Clovelly, a 'normal' form of P. barbara was found on the rocks, whereas a reduced and tall-shelled form occurred on the ascidian Pyura stolonifera, demonstrating phenotypic morphological plasticity. It was concluded that different populations of Patella barbara are both morphologically indistinguishable and genetically homogenous along the coast of South Africa, thus providing good evidence for widespread gene flow.

AB The yellow-eyed penguin is a threatened species endemic to New Zealand and its subantarctic islands. Survival and fledging success vary from year to year partly in response to changing food availability. Mortality in 'poor food' years may potentially be reduced if adults are allowed to rear only one of their two chicks. Conservation managers have therefore deliberately reduced broods to one in some recent breeding seasons, but the merits of this policy are controversial. We investigated, by simulation modelling, the conditions under which a policy of artificial brood reduction would enhance population growth. Food supply may be difficult to predict from early-season indicators so we also considered the effect of forecasting errors. Artificial brood reduction can increase the population growth rate, even in the presence of moderate forecasting errors, given a large enough cost of breeding. However, field studies suggest that the required cost of breeding is unrealistically large and the policy is unlikely to be a useful management tool for yellow-eyed penguins.

AB The spatial repartition of the zooplankton (abundance, fecundity) was studied in a morocco reservoir during a period of thermic stability in relation to some environmental factors (temperature, algal resources, suspended matter, dissolved oxygen). The horizontal repartition follows the pattern described by MARZOLF with a maximal abundance at the 2/3 of the reservoir length. The zooplankton stays in the superficial waters, the richest in algal resources, and avoids the deeper waters (below -5 m) less oxygenated, with a low algal content and exposed, on the bottom, to bioturbation by fishes. The burrowing fishes produce turbulence and a higher concentration in suspended matter capable of interfering in the alimentation of zooplankton. The authors observe, moreover, a partage of space between the two cyclopoid species T. oblongatus and T. prasinus which have similar size, behavior and diet.

AB The land snails Chondrina clienta and Balea perversa compete most probably for a limited food resource (calcicolous lichens) on rock-faces on the Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden). Two laboratory and three field experiments were conducted to determine whether food availability and intra- and interspecific interactions affect the dispersal tendency in C. clienta. Under laboratory conditions, individuals of C. clienta showed a higher tendency to disperse from previously grazed than from ungrazed pieces of limestone (their natural substratum), whereas conspecific density or presence of B. perversa had no effect. However, when snails had been kept on the pieces of limestone for 40 days prior to testing, dispersal tended to increase with increasing density of conspecifics. In the field, marked individuals of C. clienta were released at different densities on vertical rock walls. Density of conspecifics at the release points did not influence the distances travelled. Similarly, intraspecific density did not affect dispersal when the snails' food resource (lichens) had been experimentally reduced on the quarry walls. Neither was the dispersal tendency influenced by different crowding conditions experienced for 40 days prior to release. The discrepancy between the results of laboratory and field experiments suggest that additional factors acting on dispersal are of importance in natural populations of C. clienta.

AB Larvae of the antlion Callistoleon manselli New build pitfall traps that have attached radiating furrows. In order to evaluate this unique trap-building behaviour from an evolutionary viewpoint, we analysed the shape of,traps in the field, then examined the process of trap construction and the efficiency of the pitfalls in prey capture. Larvae of C manselli construct the radiating furrows after building the central pit. Larvae provided with food ad libitum tend not to construct furrows at all. Capture efficiency for the pits with furrows was greater than for pits without furrows. The pitfall traps constructed by C. manselli evidently represent a more advanced development than the simple pits of other species.

DT Article
AB Different vegetation types have been identified in the Alexandria dunefield, in relation to geomorphic history of the substrata.  Using ordination and classification, these types have been recognized as Dune Scrub, Dune Thicket, Dune Forest and Sundays River Scrub; each is representative of a different stage of vegetation development.  Multivariate analysis separated five sites along a geological gradient, enabling an indication of different degrees of vegetation and soil succession.  A decrease in Asteraceae and Poaceae together with an increase in the number of herbaceous and succulent species indicate increasing geomorphic age.  While none of the sites could be recognized as a specific vegetation, each was characterized by a unique combination of these four vegetation types.  Two successional pathways were observed to operate over different time-scales.  The first stage of the succession is from Dune Scrub to Dune Forest, while the second is from Dune Forest to Sundays River Scrub.  These successions are seen as simple changes in the relative dominance of the four vegetation types, rather than as the replacement of each towards a single climax community.  Our proposal is that these specific combinations of community structure can be used as indicators of geological age in eastern Cape coastal environments.

AB In Brazil, the country with the highest plant species richness in the world, biodiverse savannas and grasslands - i. e., grassy ecosystems, which occupy 27% of the country - have historically been neglected in conservation and scientific treatments. Reasons for this neglect include misconceptions about the characteristics and dynamics of these ecosystems, as well as inconsistent or regionally restricted terminology that impeded a more adequate communication about Brazil's savannas and grasslands, both within the country and internationally. Toward improved communication and recognition of Brazil's diversity of ecosystems, we present the key drivers that control the main types of grassy ecosystems across Brazil (including in regions of the country where forests dominate). In doing so, we synthesize the main features of each grassy ecosystem in terms of physiognomy and ecological dynamics (e.g., relationships with herbivores and fire). We propose a terminology both for major grassland regions and for regionally relevant vegetation physiognomies. We also discuss terms associated with human land management and restoration of grassy ecosystems. Finally, we suggest key research needs to advance our understanding of the ecology and conservation values of Brazil's grassy ecosystems. We expect that a common and shared terminology and understanding, as proposed here, will stimulate more integrative research that will be fundamental to developing improved conservation and restoration strategies.

AB The construction of cascade dams has led to a lack of longitudinal connectivity in rivers, fragmentation of habitats, slowing of the spread of biota, and loss of biodiversity. Here, we examined the zooplankton functional diversity in a typical river with cascade dams and compared the differences between the upstream and downstream parts of the river during the dry and wet seasons. The findings were as follows: (1) during the dry season, the nutrient load in the lower reaches of the river increased, and the water quality deteriorated, while the conditions during the wet season did not change significantly; (2) during the dry season, the functional beta diversity of downstream zooplankton caused by cascade dams was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that upstream, but this phenomenon was not prominent during the wet season; (3) during the dry season, environmental factors and dam numbers significantly affected the functional diversity of zooplankton, and the number of dams directly impacted the formation of the distribution pattern of zooplankton functional traits. These findings highlight the effects of the hydrological regulation of cascade dams in different seasons on the functional diversity of zooplankton and suggest that: 1) water retention times and pollution source inputs should be reduced during the dry season, 2) dedicated biological channels should be established to reduce the harm caused by clustered pollution to zooplankton, and 3) thermal pollution and strong scouring caused by large-scale flood discharge simultaneously should be avoided during the rainy season. Zooplankton functional diversity is sensitive to dam hydrological regulation, and we advise it be included as a critical indicator during ecosystem assessment in the dam management process, along with additional biological indicators are recommended.

AB A debate has emerged over the potential socio-ecological drivers of wildlife-origin zoonotic disease outbreaks and emerging infectious disease (EID) events. This Review explores the extent to which the incidence of wildlife-origin infectious disease outbreaks, which are likely to include devastating pandemics like HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, may be linked to excessive and increasing rates of tropical deforestation for agricultural food production and wild meat hunting and trade, which are further related to contemporary ecological crises such as global warming and mass species extinction. Here we explore a set of precautionary responses to wildlife-origin zoonosis threat, including: (a) limiting human encroachment into tropical wildlands by promoting a global transition to diets low in livestock source foods; (b) containing tropical wild meat hunting and trade by curbing urban wild meat demand, while securing access for indigenous people and local communities in remote subsistence areas; and (c) improving biosecurity and other strategies to break zoonosis transmission pathways at the wildlife-human interface and along animal source food supply chains.

AB Water turbidity can significantly influence interspecific interactions in aquatic ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that the turbidity gradient significantly differentiates the dynamics, significance and type of relationships in the structure of zooplankton communities colonizing mine pit reservoirs. The interactions between zooplankton species were evaluated by network graph analysis for three water turbidity classes: high turbidity (HT), moderate turbidity (MT) and low turbidity (LT). The HT network was most cohesive, and it was controlled by taxa grazing on various food sources within one ecological niche (Polyarthra longiremis, Brachionus angularis, Cyclops vicinus, Codonella cratera) and the positive and negative relationships between them were balanced. The MT biocenotic network was composed of three sub-networks connected by nodes with high communication attributes (Polyarthra vulgaris, Bosmina longirostris, C. vicinus), and antagonistic interactions (predation and competition) were less important. The LT network was most heterogeneous, and Daphnia cuculllata exerted the strongest influence on the network's structure by forming numerous positive (coexistence with predators) and negative (interference competition with microphagous rotifers) interspecific relationships. The study provides new information about the ecology of aquatic ecosystems, that are disturbed by changes in water turbidity.

AB Reintroductions of large carnivore species present unique opportunities to model population dynamics as populations can be monitored from the beginning of a reintroduction. However, analysis of the population dynamics of such reintroduced populations is rare and may be limited in incorporating the complex movements and environmental interactions of large carnivores. Starting in 2004, Asiatic black bears Ursus thibetanus were reintroduced and tracked in the Republic of Korea, along with their descendants, using radio telemetry, yielding 33,924 tracking points over 12 years. Along with information about habitat use, landscape, and resource availability, we estimated the population equilibrium and dispersal capability of the reintroduced population. We used a mixed modelling approach to determine suitable habitat areas, population equilibria for three different resources-based scenarios, and least-cost pathways (i.e. corridors) for dispersal. Our population simulations provided a mean population equilibrium of 64 individuals at the original reintroduction site and a potential maximum of 1,438 individuals in the country. The simulation showed that the bear population will disperse to nearby mountainous areas, but a second reintroduction will be required to fully restore U. thibetanus. Northern suitable habitats are currently disconnected and natural re-population is unlikely to happen unless supported. Our methodologies and findings are also relevant for determining the outcome and trajectories of reintroduced populations of other large carnivores.

AB Background: Larval connectivity between distinct benthic populations is essential for their persistence. Although connectivity is difficult to measure in situ, it can be predicted via models that simulate biophysical interactions between larval behaviour and ocean currents. The blue mussel (Mytilus Edulis L.) is widespread throughout the northern hemisphere and extensively commercialised worldwide. In the Irish Sea, this industry represents similar to 50% of Welsh shellfisheries, where cultivation is mainly based on wild spat. However, the main sources and amount of spat varied interannually (1100 tonnes harvest in 2014 against zero in 2018). The aim of this study is to characterise the structure and dynamics of the blue mussel metapopulation within the northern part of the Irish Sea.
   Methods: We develop a Lagrangian particle tracking model, driven by a high-resolution (from 30 to 5000 m) validated unstructured coastal hydrodynamic model of the Irish Sea, to simulate spatial and temporal variability of larval dispersal and connectivity between distinct mussel populations and potential settlement areas.
   Results: Our results showed that: (1) larvae positioned near the surface were strongly influenced by wind-driven currents suggesting that connectivity networks had the potential to span hundreds of kilometres; (2) in contrast, larvae positioned deeper in the water column were driven by tidal currents, producing intricate spatial patterns of connectivity between mussel beds over tens of kilometres that were consistent over time.
   Conclusions: Dispersal of mussel larvae in the tidally energetic Irish Sea during the April-May spawning season is potentially driven by wind-driven surface currents, as confirmed by fisherman observations of inter-annual variability in wild spat collection. These results have important implications for metapopulation dynamics within the context of climate change and sustainable shellfisheries management (i.e. gain and loss of populations and harvest areas according to wind conditions).

AB This study aims to investigate the relationship between sustainability and resilience concepts in agriculture. First, we discuss the theoretical preliminaries related to the definition of these two concepts. Indeed, the literature considers sustainability as a proxy for resilience and vice versa in the context of agriculture. Intuitively, one may expect that sustainability and resilience are positively correlated. Second, we challenge these insights by embarking on empirical analysis directed at the Northern European countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden) that are member states of the European Union. The criteria describing sustainability and economic resilience are identified for the empirical analysis. Third, the criteria decision making is applied to derive the composite indicators. The contemporaneous correlation between the composite indicators of sustainability and economic resilience is rather weak across the analyzed countries. However, the correlation increases in case the first-order differences of the composite indicators are considered. Therefore, economic resilience indicators cannot be replaced by sustainability-related ones and economic resilience should be taken as an additional facet of the economic sustainability when developing composite indicators.

AB All animals carry specialized microbiomes, and their gut microbiota are continuously released into the environment through excretion of waste. Here we propose the meta-gut as a novel conceptual framework that addresses the ability of the gut microbiome released from an animal to function outside the host and alter biogeochemical processes mediated by microbes. We demonstrate this dynamic in the hippopotamus (hippo) and the pools they inhabit. We used natural field gradients and experimental approaches to examine fecal and pool water microbial communities and aquatic biogeochemistry across a range of hippo inputs. Sequencing using 16S RNA methods revealed community coalescence between hippo gut microbiomes and the active microbial communities in hippo pools that received high inputs of hippo feces. The shared microbiome between the hippo gut and the waters into which they excrete constitutes a meta-gut system that could influence the biogeochemistry of recipient ecosystems and provide a reservoir of gut microbiomes that could influence other hosts. We propose that meta-gut dynamics may also occur where other animal species congregate in high densities, particularly in aquatic environments.

AB High-level policy debates surrounding elephant management often dominate global conservation headlines, yet realities for people living with wildlife are not adequately incorporated into policymaking or evident in related discourse.(1,2) Human health and livelihoods can be severely impacted by wildlife and indirectly by policy outcomes.(3) In landscapes where growing human and elephant (Loxodonta spp. and Elephas maximus) populations compete over limited resources, human-elephant conflict causes crop loss, human injury and death, and retaliatory killing of wildlife.(4-6) Across Africa, these problems may be increasingly compounded by climate change, which intensifies resource competition and food insecurity.(6-9) Here, we examine how human-wildlife impacts interact with climate change and household food insecurity across the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, the world's largest terrestrial transboundary conservation area, spanning five African nations. We use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models to analyze multi-country household data together with longitudinal satellite-based climate measures relevant to rainfed agriculture. We find that crop depredation by wildlife, primarily elephants, impacts 58% of sampled households annually and is associated with significant increases in food insecurity. These wildlife impacts compound effects of changing climate on food insecurity, most notably observed as a 5-day shortening of the rainy season per 10 years across the data record (1981-2018). To advance sustainability goals, global conservation policy must better integrate empirical evidence on the challenges of human-wildlife coexistence into longer term strategies at transboundary scales, specifically in the context of climate change.3,9-11

AB Species of the genus Acacia have been introduced worldwide and have negative environmental and socio-economic impacts in many introduced regions. This study makes use of environmental and socio-economic impact classification schemes for alien taxa (EICAT and SEICAT) to assess the impacts that 33 acacias introduced to South Africa have at a global scale. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the EICAT impact categories which are based on literature with expert assessments; (2) to determine which environmental and socio-economic mechanisms underlie acacia impacts; and (3) to test if certain habitats experience higher impact magnitudes than others. Most acacias had a massive impact when evaluated by experts, while the impact was mostly major for EICAT. This could be due to the use of different definitions for the impact categories. It might also show that the data available is insufficient or inadequate in showing that such high impacts exist. Competition was found to be the most often recorded mechanism underlying acacia environmental impacts and was one of the mechanisms with the largest impact magnitude. Grassland, shrubland, marine-coastal and forest habitats were found to be impacted by acacias equally as much. Using impact scoring schemes as an evidence-based and transparent approach to determine the impact status of alien species provides a more robust method to aid management prioritisation and risk assessment than expert opinion alone. However, data quality and availability could limit their effectiveness, especially for less well studied species.

AB Discussions on the evolutionary process and mechanism of social-ecological landscape resilience play an important role in maintaining the sustainable provision of landscape services. However, studies on the evolutionary process and mechanism of social-ecological landscapes at the microscale have received relatively little attention. The purpose of this research is to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of social-ecological landscape resilience at the micro-level in Gaoqu Township in Mizhi County, China. A three-dimensional (ecosystem, social system, and production system) indicator was constructed to quantitatively evaluate the social-ecological landscape resilience. The results showed that (1) the spatio-temporal variation in the three subsystems' resilience was extensive from 2012 to 2018. The ecosystem resilience was distributed in the northeast-southwest direction, which was consistent with the distribution of gullies. The social system resilience was spatially high in the northwest and low in the southeast. The production system resilience was low in the middle and high in the peripheral regions. The resilience values of the ecosystem, social system and production system increased by 0.127, 0.122 and 0.101, respectively. (2) The spatio-temporal differentiation of the social-ecological landscape resilience was also significant, and its resilience value increased by 11.44%, which showed a spatial pattern with a low center and high surroundings. (3) Finally, based on the status and trend of the social-ecological landscape resilience, 20 villages in the region can be divided into predominantly advancing areas, predominantly stable areas, predominantly attenuation areas, emerging advancing areas, and sensitive-vulnerable areas. This study can provide the spatial guidance for differentiated sustainable development in the Loess hill and gully region based on the local conditions of the socialecological landscapes.

AB While there is a general understanding of broadscale patterns of the region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP)'s biodiversity, this is largely reliant upon knowledge of species richness. Less known is the correlation between species richness and other measures of biodiversity, and how this correlation varies among different types of taxa. Using county-level seed plant data for the QTP region, we identified and compared regional species-rich areas, using six indices quantifying taxonomic, endemic and phylogenetic diversity for distinct plant types (trees, shrubs, herbs, endemic/non-endemic, alpine/non-alpine/non-alpine-endemic plants). We modelled diversity for each index and plant types using predictors of contemporary climate, topography and historical factors. We found a high congruence between species richness and phylogenetic diversity, which showed a consistent gradient from high values in the southeast to low values in the northwest. We confirm that this known pattern was largely associated with contemporary climatic and topographic predictors. There was a similarly high congruence of species-rich areas among plant types, except for alpine species. Strikingly, we identified species-rich areas which were previously unrecognized. Their identification largely derives from a low congruence between general patterns and patterns predicted by corrected weighted endemism. Nine of these species-rich areas are located where coverage in nature reserves is absent or inadequate, highlighting clear conservation gaps in the regional conservation strategy. Our study is the first to compare taxonomic, endemic and phylogenetic diversity for different plant types in the QTP region. Thus, it provides the essential bases for designing strategies for local to regional biodiversity conservation.

AB Global declines in biodiversity have the potential to affect ecosystem function, and vice versa, in both terrestrial and aquatic ecological realms. While many studies have considered biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationships at local scales within single realms, there is a critical need for more studies examining BEF linkages among ecological realms, across scales, and across trophic levels. We present a framework linking abiotic attributes, productivity, and biodiversity across terrestrial and inland aquatic realms. We review examples of the major ways that BEF linkages form across realms-cross-system subsidies, ecosystem engineering, and hydrology. We then formulate testable hypotheses about the relative strength of these connections across spatial scales, realms, and trophic levels. While some studies have addressed these hypotheses individually, to holistically understand and predict the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function, researchers need to move beyond local and simplified systems and explicitly investigate cross-realm and trophic interactions and large-scale patterns and processes. Recent advances in computational power, data synthesis, and geographic information science can facilitate studies spanning multiple ecological realms that will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of BEF connections.

AB Old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs) have been hypothesized to harbour an elevated number of persistent plant lineages and are predicted to occur across different parts of the globe, interspersed with other types of landscapes. We tested whether the mean age of a plant community is associated with occurrence on OCBILs, as predicted by climatic stability and poor soil environments. Using digitized occurrence data for seed plants occurring in Australia (7033 species), sub-Saharan Africa (3990 species) and South America (44 482 species), regions that comprise commonly investigated OCBILs (Southwestern Australian Floristic Region, Greater Cape Floristic Region and campos rupestres), and phylogenies pruned to match the species occurrences, we tested for associations between environmental data (current climate, soil composition, elevation and climatic stability) and two novel metrics developed here that capture the age of a community (mean tip length and mean node height). Our results indicate that plant community ages are influenced by a combination of multiple environmental predictors that vary globally; we did not find statistically strong associations between the environments of OCBIL areas and community age, in contrast to the prediction for these landscapes. The Cape Floristic Region was the only OCBIL that showed a significant, although not strong, overlap with old communities.

AB Human activities have dramatically changed ecosystems. As an irreplaceable ecological barrier in western China, the Qilian Mountains (QLM) provide various ecosystem services for humans. To evaluate the changes in the intensity of human activities in the QLM and their impact on the ecosystem, the human footprint (HF) method was used to conduct a spatial dataset of human activity intensity. In our study, the NDVI was used to characterize the growth of vegetation, and six categories of human pressures were employed to create the HF map in the QLM for 2000-2015 at a 1-km scale. The results showed that the mean NDVI during the growing season showed a significant increasing trend over the entire QLM in the period 2000-2015, while the NDVI showed a significant declining trend of more than 70% concentrated in Qinghai. Human pressure throughout the QLM occurred at a low level during 2000-2015, being greater in the eastern region than the western region, while the Qinghai area had greater human pressure than the Gansu area. Due to the improvement in traffic facilities, tourism, overgrazing, and other illegal activities, grasslands, shrublands, forests, wetlands, and bare land were the vegetation types most affected by human activities (in decreasing order). As the core area of the QLM, the Qilian Mountains National Nature Reserve (NR) has effectively reduced the impact of human activities. However, due to the existence of many ecological historical debts caused by unreasonable management in the past, the national park established in 2017 is facing great challenges to achieve its goals. These data and results will provide reference and guidance for future protection and restoration of the QLM ecosystem.

AB Antarctic soils generally have low temperatures and limited availability of liquid water and nutrients. However, animals can increase the nutrient availability of ice-free areas by transferring nutrients from marine to terrestrial ecosystems, mainly through their excreta. In this study, we employed shotgun metagenomics and population genome binning techniques to study the diversity of microbial communities in Antarctic soils impacted by marine pinnipeds and birds relative to soils with no evident animal presence. We obtained-285,000 16S rRNA gene carrying metagenomic reads representing-60 phyla and 100 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) representing eight phyla. Only nine of these 100 MAGs represented previously described species, revealing that these soils harbor extensive novel diversity. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in all samples, with Rhodanobacter being one of the most abundant genera in the bird impacted soils. Further, the relative abundance of genes related to denitrification was at least double in soils impacted by birds than soils without animal influence. These results advance our understanding of the microbial populations and their genes involved in nitrous oxide emissions in ice-free coastal Antarctic soils impacted by marine animals and reveal novel microbial diversity associated with these ecosystems.

AB Given differing trajectories of sea turtle populations worldwide, there is a need to assess and report long-term population trends and determine which conservation strategies are effective. In this study, we report on sea turtle nest monitoring in the Cayman Islands over a 22-year period. We found that green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nest numbers increased significantly across the three islands since monitoring began in 1998, but that hawksbill nest numbers remained low with a maximum of 13 nests recorded in a season. Comparing the first 5 years of nest numbers to the most recent 5 years, the greatest percentage increase in green turtle nests was in Grand Cayman from 82 to 1,005 nests (1,126%), whereas the greatest percentage increase for loggerhead turtle nests was in Little Cayman from 10 to 290 nests (3,800%). A captive breeding operation contributed to the increase in the Grand Cayman green turtle population, however, loggerhead turtles were never captive-bred, and these populations began to increase after a legal traditional turtle fishery became inactive in 2008. Although both species have shown significant signs of recovery, populations remain at a fragment of their historical level and are vulnerable to threats. Illegal harvesting occurs to this day, with multiple females taken from nesting beaches each year. For nests and hatchlings, threats include artificial lighting on nesting beaches, causing hatchlings to misorient away from the sea, and inundation of nests by seawater reducing hatch success. The impacts of lighting were found to increase over the monitoring period. Spatial data on nest distribution was used to identify critical nesting habitat for green and loggerhead turtles and is used by the Cayman Islands Department of Environment to facilitate remediation of threats related to beachside development and for targeted future management efforts.

TI Management and fire, a critical combination for Eucalyptus globulus
   dispersal
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Sapling establishment; Eucalypt plantations; Seed-trees; Out of season
   fires
AB In a context of growing demands for wood and wood derived products, plantations of exotic tree species have globally increased. Fast growth and high productivity made Eucalyptus one of the most successful tree genus around the world. Nevertheless, this genus is often associated with negative ecological impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and the risk of expansion is considered a major threat. Eucalyptus globulus is the most planted tree species in Portugal, but common silvicultural measures, including periodic control of the understory vegetation, have traditionally limited natural regeneration. However, forest fires constitute a main driver of E. globulus dispersal and regeneration and, under the current climatic change scenario, the possible extension of the summer fire regime to previous months in spring and/or later months in autumn, may have a profound effect on E. globulus dispersal capacity. Moreover, isolated eucalypt trees, seed-trees, are often left uncut and many plantations are poorly managed potentially increasing the risk of E. globulus dispersal. To evaluate the impact of both management and fire event dates on E. globulus dispersal, we assessed the establishment of saplings beyond plantations and seed-trees surrounding areas in absence of fire and after 2017 June and October fires in managed and unmanaged conditions. Sapling survival was also analyzed two years after fire. Our results point out that sapling establishment in our study area is not a major concern in the absence of fire. Also, our findings showed that E. globulus establishment is highly dependent on the time of the year a fire occurs and that pre-fire management practices constrain E. globulus dispersal. We also found that seed-trees are high seed dispersers after fire even in managed conditions, deserving great concern. Additionally, sapling survival two years after October fire indicate that out of season fires might constitute an emerging issue regarding E. globulus expansion.

AB The relationship between metapopulation stability and connectivity has long been investigated in ecology, however, most of these studies are focused on theoretical species and habitat networks, having limited ability to capture the complexity of real-world metapopulations. Network analysis became more important in modeling connectivity, but it is still uncertain which network metrics are reliable predictors of persistence. Here we quantify the impact of connectivity and larval life history on marine metapopulation persistence across the complex seascape of southeast Australia. Our work coupled network-based approaches and eigenanalysis to efficiently estimate metapopulation-wide persistence and the subpopulation contributions. Larval dispersal models were used to quantify species-specific metapopulation connectivity for five important fisheries species, each summarized as a migration matrix. Eigenanalysis helped to reveal metapopulation persistence and determine the importance of node-level network properties. Across metapopulations, the number of local outgoing connections was found to have the largest impact on metapopulation persistence, implying these hub subpopulations may be the most influential in real-world metapopulations. Results also suggest the length of the pre-competency period may be the most influential parameter on metapopulation persistence. Finally, we identified two major hot spots of local connectivity in southeast Australia, each contributing strongly to multispecies persistence. Managers and ecologists would benefit by employing similar approaches in making more efficient and more ecologically informed decisions and focusing more on local connectivity patterns and larval competency characteristics to better understand and protect real-world metapopulation persistence. Practically this could mean developing more marine protected areas at shorter distances and supporting collaborative research into the early life histories of the species of interest.

AB Seabirds are vital, but overlooked, components of coastal marine ecosystems and may connect the marine and terrestrial environment at a global scale, significantly contributing to inter-habitat connectivity and the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Although the ecological and functional role of birds in terrestrial areas, islands in particular, has been deeply studied since the last century, the same does not hold true for coastal marine areas. Given the importance of coastal areas for seabirds worldwide and, at the same time, the high vulnerability of both, looking into the role of seabirds in influencing the ecosystem functioning in coastal areas is needed nowadays. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of seabirds on coastal ecological processes giving particular emphasis on the linkage between the seabird functions that are crucial in influencing the ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services, and disservices, for the human well-being. Seabirds can contribute to shaping coastal ecological processes and services in a multitude of ways, among which directly influencing trophic status, environmental contamination, biodiversity and food webs through trophic (bottom-up or top-down) and non-trophic processes. We identified areas for future research to further clarify this linkage and promote seabird conservation.

AB Congeneric species may coexist at fine spatial scales through niche differentiation, however, the magnitude to which the effects of functional traits and phylogenetic relatedness contribute to their distribution along elevational gradients remains understudied. To test the hypothesis that trait and elevational range overlap can affect local species & apos; coexistence, we first compared phylogenetic relatedness and trait (including morphological traits and leaf elements) divergence among closely related species of Rhododendron L. on Yulong Mountain, China. We then assessed relationships between the overlap of multiple functional traits and the degree of elevational range overlap among species pairs in a phylogenetic context. We found that phylogeny was a good predictor for most functional traits, where closely related species showed higher trait similarity and occupied different elevational niches at our study site. Species pairs of R. subgen. Hymenanthes (Blume) K. Koch showed low elevational range overlap and some species pairs of R. subgen. Rhododendron showed obvious niche differentiation. Trait divergence is greater for species in R. subgen. Rhododendron, and it plays an important role between species pairs with low elevational range overlap. Trait convergent selection takes place between co-occurring closely related species that have high elevational range overlap, which share more functional trait space due to environmental filtering or ecological adaptation in more extreme habitats. Our results highlight the importance of evolutionary history and trait selection for species coexistence at fine ecological scales along environmental gradients.

AB The expansion of woody plants into grasslands and old fields is often ascribed to fire suppression and heavy grazing, especially by domestic livestock. However, it is also recognized that nutrient availability and interspecific competition with grasses and other woody plants play a role in certain habitats. I examined potential factors causing range- and niche expansion by the eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana, the most widespread conifer in the eastern United States, in multifactorial experiments in a greenhouse. Historical records suggest that the eastern redcedar is a pioneer forest species, and may be replaced as the forest increases in tree density due to shading. Another possible factor that affects its distribution may be nutrient availability, which is higher in old fields and other disturbed lands than in undisturbed habitats. In its historic range, eastern redcedars are particularly abundant on limestone outcrops, often termed 'cedar barrens'. However, the higher abundance on limestone could be due to reduced interspecific competition rather than a preference for high pH substrates. I manipulated shade, fertilization, lime, and interspecific competition with a common dominant tree, the post oak Quercus stellata. In a separate experiment, I manipulated fire and grass competition. I measured growth rates (height and diameter) and above- and belowground biomass at the end of both experiments. I also measured total non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen in these plants. Shade was the most important factor limiting the growth rates and biomass of eastern redcedars. I also found that there were significant declines in nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates when shaded. These results are consistent with the notion that the eastern redcedar is a pioneer forest species, and that shade is the reason that these redcedars are replaced by other tree species. In the second experiment, I found that a single fire had a negative effect on young trees. There was no significant effect of competition with grass, perhaps because the competitive effect was shading by grasses and not nutrient depletion. Overall, the effects of shade were far more apparent than the effects of fire.

AB Xeric shrubs often play an important role in reversing desertification and promoting ecological restoration of degraded dryland ecosystems. However, how shrubs affect their associated herbaceous species and environmental conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, we conducted a removal experiment along with stable isotope analysis to determine the water use strategy of a shrub species (Artemisia ordosica) and its associated perennial graminoids (PG) in the Mu Us Desert, northern China. We observed that in the intact plots, both shrubs and PG predominantly utilized water from the shallow soil layer (0-20 cm, 54.36%, and 63.63%, respectively). Compared to this, when shrubs were removed, soil water content decreased, the main water source of PG switched to the middle soil layer (20-60 cm, 48.25%), and their water use efficiency (WUE) increased. However, the removal of PG had no significant impacts on the soil water content in any layer or on the water source of shrubs but for slightly decreased WUE. We highlighted that rather than hydraulic lift, shade-induced evaporation decline is the primary mechanism by which shrubs facilitate the growth of associated herbaceous plants in desert ecosystems, indicating that the facilitated herbaceous plants have more flexible water use strategies than shrubs, which probably drives the community succession from being shrub-dominated to herb-dominated.

AB Estimates of population density of mammals are critical data for effective management. Estimating density is complicated if the species of interest has cryptic markings and occupies dense habitat. Sitatunga is such a species, specially adapted to the dense swamps and marshes of sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional population survey techniques have been ineffective. In this study, we used camera traps to estimate density of sitatunga in central Uganda using both spatial capture-recapture methods and time in front of the camera (TIFC). We collected data in three years, 2015-2017. The TIFC model resulted in density estimates similar to the spatial capture-recapture models, without needing information on movement or individual identification. However, spatial capture-recapture models provide an estimate of movement and home range, which is of interest to management. For sitatunga, spatial capture-recapture models revealed higher movement parameters and higher heterogeneity in movement than previously reported. These results illustrate the utility of camera traps for a cryptic species in dense habitats, and provide a potential alternative to spatial capture-recapture methods. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Recent evidence shows that in lotic, physically-dominated ecosystems like large rivers, zooplankton can develop spatially structured assemblages and fulfill functionally important roles. While refuting the long-standing notion that riverine zooplankton communities are numerically depauperate and spatially homogeneous, this also shows that the importance of abiotic and biotic drivers and the consistency of ecological patterns are still poorly understood for these communities.
   We collected zooplankton along 300 km of the Illinois River for 5 years to test the influence of a suite of biotic and abiotic variables on zooplankton density, biomass, and diversity. We hypothesized abiotic variables such as temperature, turbidity, and velocity would be predominant predictors, with biotic variables like planktivory becoming important when physical factors do not constrain them.
   Results showed basin-wide declines in zooplankton taxonomic richness as planktivory from the invading silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) increased. In contrast, density and biomass were explained by abiotic factors at the basin scale, with velocity, turbidity, and pH driving biomass and velocity driving density. We also found that both the driving factors and the plankton responses varied among the upper, middle, and lower sections of the Illinois River.
   We conclude that while zooplankton communities of the Illinois River are highly structured in space, the driving forces behind their distribution patterns are not simple. Instead, there is a complex spatio-temporal template of biological, chemical, and hydraulic factors shaping these communities in the Illinois River. Along with emphasizing the importance of spatial heterogeneity in large river ecosystems, these results also support a growing view that invasive species interactions can supersede the well-established role of abiotic factors in explaining global freshwater diversity losses. This also highlights the importance of including long-term zooplankton sampling in ecological monitoring programs in diverse and productive large river systems like the Illinois.

AB Cross-shore velocities in the coastal ocean typically vary with depth. The direction and magnitude of transport experienced by meroplanktonic larvae will therefore be influenced by their vertical position. To quantify how swimming behavior and vertical position in internal waves influence larval cross-shore transport in the shallow (similar to 20 m), stratified coastal waters off Southern California, we deployed swarms of novel, subsurface larval mimics, the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorers (M-AUEs). The M-AUEs were programmed to maintain a specified depth, and were deployed near a mooring. Transport of the M-AUEs was predominantly onshore, with average velocities up to 14 cm s(-1). To put the M-AUE deployments into a broader context, we simulated > 500 individual high-frequency internal waves observed at the mooring over a 14-d deployment; in each internal wave, we released both depth-keeping and passive virtual larvae every meter in the vertical. After the waves' passage, depth-keeping virtual larvae were usually found closer to shore than passive larvae released at the same depth. Near the top of the water column (3-5-m depth), similar to 20% of internal waves enhanced onshore transport of depth-keeping virtual larvae by >= 50 m, whereas only 1% of waves gave similar enhancements to passive larvae. Our observations and simulations showed that depth-keeping behavior in high-frequency internal waves resulted in enhanced onshore transport at the top of the water column, and reduced offshore dispersal at the bottom, compared to being passive. Thus, even weak depth-keeping may allow larvae to reach nearshore adult habitats more reliably than drifting passively.

AB Multiple invaders usually co-occur in an ecosystem and threaten the ecological safety of ecosystems. Invasive species from the same origin could facilitate each other's establishment, while some species could suppress invasion from others with similar traits. For the successful management of aquatic ecosystems invaded by multiple invasive species, we need to better understand the interaction between multiple common-origin invasive aquatic plants and native aquatic plants with similar traits in a community. A native species,Ludwigia peploides, and two invasive species from the same origin,Myriophyllum aquaticumandAlternanthera philoxeroideswere grown as a monoculture (no competitor) or a mixed culture (with competitor) to determine the interactions between the species. The biomass, morphological and photosynthetic physiological traits were measured. The results showed that the biomass traits, relative growth rate and morphological traits (except specific leaf area) ofL. peploideswere higher than those of the two invasive species. Additionally,L. peploideshad significantly higher photosynthetic physiological traits than those ofM. aquaticum(in all treatments) andA. philoxeroides(in monoculture). The mixed-culture treatments had relatively less effect on most of the growth traits ofL. peploides.However, most of the mixed-culture treatments prominently reduced the biomass, morphological traits and photosynthetic physiological traits of the two invasive species. In addition, the native species had a greater competitive effect than both invaders. Overall, co-invasion between the two invaders was not observed. Furthermore, these results support that highly competitive native species could reduce the growth and the invasive success of less competitive invasive species with similar traits in communities.

AB Context Floodplains are complex adaptive ecosystems that provide an array of ecosystem services. Despite the growing focus on resilience as a fundamental feature of floodplain ecosystems, and as an aim in floodplain management, few studies have quantified the resilience of floodplain landscapes over meaningful timescales. Objectives This study examines the resilience of floodplain vegetation communities over medium (decadal) and long term (multi-decadal) times scales through an analysis of the spatial organisation of different vegetation communities. The floodplain vegetation landscape is conceived as having two basins of attraction represented by; (1). Natural vegetation, which incorporates two domains of flood dependent (FD) and non-flood dependent (NFD) vegetation communities; and, (2). Cleared vegetation (CL). Methods We examine change in the spatial organisation of vegetation communities on the Yanga floodplain, located on the Murrumbidgee River, Australia, over a forty-year period (1965-2005). Detailed vegetation community maps, constructed from orthorectified aerial photographs for the years 1965, 1973, 1997 and 2005, were used. Results Substantial changes in the extent and spatial configuration of vegetation communities occurred over the 40-year period. Many changes were bidirectional transitions between FD and NFD vegetation communities, representing transitions in response to variations in flood frequency. However, the predominant unidirectional transition of the FD and NFD vegetation communities were to CL. Conclusions The dynamic character of the Yanga Floodplain vegetation landscape is shown by 91 detectable transitions among vegetation community types. Despite large areas of the floodplain vegetation landscape having undergone persistent community change, some areas of the floodplain display resilience over the 40-year period. This suggests floodplain vegetation communities are well adapted to substantial changes in environmental conditions as a result of episodic flooding and drying. However, large net changes and an increase in CL, which did not revert back to previous vegetation community types, suggest a transition to a different basin of attraction, and a loss of system resilience.

TI A portfolio perspective of rural livelihoods in Bushbuckridge, South

   households; sustainable livelihoods
ID DIRECT-USE VALUES; RESOURCES; SAVANNA; PATTERNS; INCOMES
AB Land-based income streams, which include the consumption and selling of crops, livestock and environmental products, are inherent in rural households' livelihoods. However, the off-farm cash income stream - primarily composed of migrant labour remittances, social grants, and savings and loans - is increasing in importance in many regions. This case study of 590 households from Bushbuckridge, South Africa, analyses the economic value of each of these income streams at three points: what enters the household, what is used and what is sold. Two important findings emerge. First, dependence on off-farm cash incomes is far higher than previously suggested by case studies in the area and the benefits of employment accrue to those already better educated and wealthier. This suggests that shifts in off-farm opportunities will exacerbate already deep inequalities. Second, while environmental products and crops are important for direct use, they generate insignificant cash incomes from sales. This suggests a weakening of the direct links between the local ecosystem and this society, challenging traditional notions of African rurality being intrinsically land based.
   Significance:
   Off-farm incomes such as wage labour, remittances and social grants are almost the sole source of cash for households in the study area. Even when including non-monetary incomes such as harvested produce, foraged goods and livestock products, off-farm incomes still represent the overwhelmingly largest proportion of overall household income value. This highlights the fact that South African rural economies are not consistently or primarily land based, and indicates the necessity of rural development strategies that facilitate participation in local cash economies. Otherwise, such efforts will be unable to yield broad benefits and will, instead, simply enrich those who are already better off.

AB The world's second largest expanse of tropical rainforest is in Central Africa, and it harbours enormous species diversity. Population genetic studies have consistently revealed significant structure across Central African rainforest plants. In particular, previous studies have repeatedly demonstrated a north-south genetic discontinuity around the equatorial line, in a continuous expanse of rainforest where a climatic inversion is documented. Here, we took a phylogeographic approach by sequencing 351 nuclear markers in 112 individuals across the distribution of the African rainforest tree speciesAnnickia affinis(Annonaceae). We showed for the first time that the north-south divide is the result of a single, major colonization event across the climatic inversion from an ancestral population located in Gabon. We suggested that differences in ecological niche of populations located on either side of this inversion may have contributed to this phylogenetic discontinuity. We found evidence for inland dispersal, predominantly in northern areas, and variable demographic histories among genetic clusters, indicating that populations responded differently to past climate change. We show how newly developed genomic tools can provide invaluable insights into our understanding of tropical rainforest evolutionary dynamics.

AB Wildlife ranching, although not considered a conventional conservation system, provides a sustainable model for wildlife utilization and could be a source of valuable genetic material. However, increased fragmentation and intensive management may threaten the evolutionary potential and conservation value of species. Disease-free Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) in southern Africa exist in populations with a variety of histories and management practices. We compared the genetic diversity of buffalo in national parks to private ranches and found that, except for Addo Elephant National Park, genetic diversity was high and statistically equivalent. We found that relatedness and inbreeding levels were not substantially different between ranched populations and those in national parks, indicating that breeding practices likely did not yet influence genetic diversity of buffalo on private ranches in this study. High genetic differentiation between South African protected areas highlighted their fragmented nature. Structure analysis revealed private ranches comprised three gene pools, with origins from Addo Elephant National Park, Kruger National Park and a third, unsampled gene pool. Based on these results, we recommend the Addo population be supplemented with disease-free Graspan and Mokala buffalo (of Kruger origin). We highlight the need for more research to characterize the genetic diversity and composition of ranched wildlife species, in conjunction with wildlife ranchers and conservation authorities, in order to evaluate the implications for management and conservation of these species across different systems.

AB Hypoxia is often thought of as the key factor responsible for fish kill events in coastal areas but fish kill events are too complex to be governed by a single factor. The events are influenced by a combination of chemical, biological and physical processes. Hydrodynamics play a key role in understanding the formation of hypoxia in shallow waters. This study aims to identify the settings of the physical forces that lead to a large-scale depletion of dissolved oxygen in Kuwait Bay at the northwest of the Arabian Gulf. The assessment, made with a validated three-dimensional numerical model (Alosairi and Alsulaiman, 2019), revealed that the pollution from the outfalls leads to nearfield depletion of dissolved oxygen but has only a minor effect on the bay-scale dissolved oxygen. This is a result of the strong dynamics of Kuwait Bay, which mixes the pollutant rapidly before it is transported seawards. Offshore, a low dynamic region has been identified near Jahra Bay which is susceptible to occasional dissolved oxygen depletion. Assessment of the physical forces revealed that the density-driven current and, to a greater extent the wind regime, controlled the formation of a hypoxic parcel near Jahra Bay. The combination of neap tides and low mixed winds reduced mixing and enabled the longer residence times of Kuwait Bay. These are the most critical circumstances, as the average dissolved oxygen can be reduced by 50% during summer. The circumstance resulting in low dynamics near Jahra Bay were also found to be effective in explaining algal blooms.

AB In freshwater ecosystems, habitat heterogeneity supports high invertebrate density and diversity, and it contributes to the introduction and settlement of non-native species. In the present study, we identified the habitat preferences and trophic level of Brachydiplax chalybea flavovittata larvae, which were distributed in four of the 17 wetlands we examined in the Yeongsan River basin, South Korea. Larval density varied across four microhabitat types: open water area, and microhabitats dominated by Myriophyllum aquaticum, Paspalum distichum, and Zizania latifolia. Microhabitats dominated by M. aquaticum had the highest larval density, followed by those dominated by P. distichum. The larvae were more prevalent in silt sediments than in plant debris or sand. Stable isotope analysis showed that B. chalybea flavovittata is likely to consume, as a food source, other species of Odonata larvae. We conclude that successful settlement of B. chalybea flavovittata can be attributed to their habitat preferences. As temperature increases due to climate change, the likelihood of B. chalybea flavovittata spreading throughout South Korea increases. We, therefore, recommend continued monitoring of the spread and ecological impacts of B. chalybea flavovittata.

AB Punts pinaster is a common plantation species in many Mediterranean-climate regions of the world and has become invasive in several of these, but little is known about its invasive potential, with no studies regarding its invasion potential and patterns being carried out in Australia. It has been widely planted over many decades in the Perth region of southwest Australia. Here we used plots to measure the density, size and approximate age of P. pinaster wildings in native vegetation adjacent to pine plantations and in areas of cleared plantations. Results demonstrated that densities of P. pinaster wildings were highest at edges and varied widely with vegetation type, being much greater in dense, wetland vegetation compared to more open sclerophyllous woodlands, which was contrary to that experienced in other regions. Wilding regeneration following clearing was also highly variable. Local populations of black cockatoos, which fell cones to ground for feeding, are likely to have contributed to low levels of spread into native bushland by curtailing wind dispersal of seeds from tree canopies, as well as providing an ample seed source for regeneration of wildings at cleared sites. Wildfires, which can lead to mass regeneration of P. pinaster elsewhere, did not promote spread of wildings into adjoining bushland, but did enhance wilding densities in wetland vegetation within the plantation matrix.

AB Penguin colonies in Antarctica offer an ideal "natural laboratory" to investigate ecosystem function and the nitrogen (N) cycle. This study assessed the spatial distribution of penguin-derived N from guano and quantitatively assessed its impact on plant N utilization strategies in Victoria Land, Ross Sea region, Antarctica. Soil, moss, and aquatic microbial mats were collected inside and outside an active Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and analyzed for delta N-15 of total and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N and NO3--N). The soil total nitrogen (TN), NH4+-N, and NO3--N concentrations, as well as their delta N-15 values were significantly higher in guano-impacted areas than those in guano-free areas, verifying that guano is an important N source at and near penguin colonies. However, even far from the penguin colonies, soil delta N-15 values resembled those in penguin colonies, suggesting strong spatial impacts of penguin-derived N. The moss impacted by guano was more enriched in delta N-15 than in guano-free areas. The delta N-15 values of NH4+-N and NO3--N in soils covered with moss revealed that the moss might prefer inorganic N in the absence of guano, while the dissolved organic N would become an important source for moss growing on ornithogenic soils. Aquatic microbial mat samples near penguin colonies were N-15-enriched, but N-15-depleted at upland sites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin that biomagnifies in marine food webs. Inorganic mercury (Hg) methylation is conducted by heterotrophic bacteria inhabiting sediment or settling detritus, but endogenous methylation by the gut microbiome of animals in the lower food webs is another possible source. We examined the occurrence of the bacterial gene (hgcA), required for Hg methylation, in the guts of dominant zooplankters in the Northern Baltic Sea. A qPCR assay targeting the hgcA sequence in three main clades (Deltapro-teobacteria, Firmicutes and Archaea) was used in the field-collected specimens of copepods (Acartia bifilosa, Eurytemora affinis, Pseudocalanus acuspes and Limnocalanus macrurus) and cladocerans (Bosmina coregoni maritima and Cercopagis pengoi). All copepods were found to carry hgcA genes in their gut microbiome, whereas no amplification was recorded in the cladocerans. In the copepods, hgcA genes belonging to only Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were detected. These findings suggest a possibility that endogenous Hg methylation occurs in zooplankton and may contribute to seasonal, spatial and vertical MeHg variability in the water column and food webs. Additional molecular and meta-genomics studies are needed to identify bacteria carrying hgcA genes and improve their quantification in microbiota.

AB Wildlife counts in Africa and elsewhere are often implemented using light aircraft with 'rear-seat-observer' (RSO) counting crews. Previous research has indicated thatRSOs often fail to detect animals, and that population estimates are therefore biased. We conducted aerial wildlife surveys in Murchison Falls Protected Area, Uganda, in which we replacedRSOs with high-definition 'oblique camera count' (OCC) systems. The survey area comprises forests, woodlands and grasslands. Four counts were conducted in 2015-2016 using a systematic-reconnaissance-flight (SRF) strip-transect design. Camera inclination angles, focal lengths, altitude and frame interval were calibrated to provide imaged strips of known sample size on the left and right sides of the aircraft. Using digital cameras, 24 000 high-definition images were acquired for each count, which were visually interpreted by four airphoto interpreters. We used the standard JollyII SRFanalysis to derive population estimates. OurOCCestimates of the antelopes - hartebeest, Uganda kob, waterbuck and oribi - were, respectively, 25%, 103%, 97% and 2100% higher than in the most recentRSOcount conducted in 2014. TheOCCsurveys doubled the 2014RSOestimate of 58 000 Uganda kob to over 118 000. Population size estimates of elephants and giraffes did not differ significantly. Although all fourOCCbuffalo estimates were higher than theRSOestimates - in one count by 60% - these differences were not significant due to the clumped distribution and high variation in herd sizes, resulting in imprecise estimation by sampling. We conclude thatRSOwildlife counts in Murchison have been effective in enumerating elephants and giraffe, but that many smaller species have not been well detected. We emphasize the importance of 60 years ofRSO-based surveys across Africa, but suggest that new imaging technologies are embraced to improve accuracy.

AB Recently, several studies have reported relationships between the abundance of organisms in an ecological community and their mean body size (called cross-community scaling relationships: CCSRs) that can be described by simple power functions. A primary focus of these studies has been on the scaling exponent (slope) and whether it approximates -3/4, as predicted by Damuth's rule and the metabolic theory in ecology. However, some CCSR studies have reported scaling exponents significantly different from the theoretical value of -3/4. Why this variation occurs is still largely unknown. The purpose of our commentary is to show the value of examining both the slopes and elevations of CCSRs and how various ecological factors may affect them. As a heuristic exercise, we reanalyzed three published data sets based on phytoplankton, rodent, and macroinvertebrate assemblages that we subdivided according to three distinctly different ecological factors (i.e., climate zone, season, and trophic level). Our analyses reveal significant variation in either or both the CCSR slopes and elevations for marine phytoplankton communities across climate zones, a desert rodent community across seasons, and saltwater lagoon macroinvertebrate communities across trophic levels. We conclude that achieving a comprehensive understanding of abundance-size relationships at the community level will require consideration of both slopes and elevations of these relationships and their possible variation in different ecological contexts.

AB The size of plant stomata (adjustable pores that determine the uptake of CO2 and loss of water from leaves) is considered to be evolutionarily important. This study uses fossils from the major Southern Hemisphere family Proteaceae to test whether stomatal cell size responded to Cenozoic climate change. We measured the length and abundance of guard cells (the cells forming stomata), the area of epidermal pavement cells, stomatal index and maximum stomatal conductance from a comprehensive sample of fossil cuticles of Proteaceae, and extracted published estimates of past temperature and atmospheric CO2. We developed a novel test based on stochastic modelling of trait evolution to test correlations among traits. Guard cell length increased, and stomatal density decreased significantly with decreasing palaeotemperature. However, contrary to expectations, stomata tended to be smaller and more densely packed at higher atmospheric CO2. Thus, associations between stomatal traits and palaeoclimate over the last 70 million years in Proteaceae suggest that stomatal size is significantly affected by environmental factors other than atmospheric CO2. Guard cell length, pavement cell area, stomatal density and stomatal index covaried in ways consistent with coordinated development of leaf tissues.

AB We study nonlinear dynamics on complex networks. Each vertex i has a state xi which evolves according to a networked dynamics to a steady-state x*(i). We develop fundamental tools to learn the true steady-state of a small part of the network, without knowing the full network. A naive approach and the current state-of-the-art is to follow the dynamics of the observed partial network to local equilibrium. This dramatically fails to extract the true steady state. We use a mean-field approach to map the dynamics of the unseen part of the network to a single node, which allows us to recover accurate estimates of steady-state on as few as 5 observed vertices in domains ranging from ecology to social networks to gene regulation. Incomplete networks are the norm in practice, and we offer new ways to think about nonlinear dynamics when only sparse information is available.

AB Breeding seabirds, often nest at high densities and supply large amounts of marine-derived nutrients, such as nitrogen, in their feces into the ecosystems surrounding their breeding colonies. It has been well demonstrated that the nitrogen supplied by seabirds (seabird-N) into terrestrial ecosystems has a strong bottom-up effect on both producers and consumers. The seabird-N can reach into the surrounding marine ecosystems near the colony through multiple pathways including the surface run-off of rainwater or leaching by ground water. However, in marine ecosystems the bottom-up effects of seabird-N have been rarely documented. A few studies using stable isotope analyses have reported that seabird-N enhances the productivity of both phytoplankton and macro algae. There have been more limited studies documenting similar positive effects of seabird-N on marine consumers. Very little is known about spatio-temporal variations in the effects of the seabird-N on marine ecosystems. To understand the ecosystem functions of seabirds in marine nutrient cycling and the bottom-up effects of seabird-N in marine ecosystems, further research is necessary.

AB Large mammals play significant roles in shaping the trophic structure of terrestrial ecosystems and affect the form of vegetation growth in many habitats. We studied large mammal community in a Mediterranean habitat mosaic generated by fires originally dominated by pine forests. We conducted camera-trapping surveys in three study sites with different fire histories, and we recorded eight large mammal species including brown bear (Ursus arctos), caracal (Caracal caracal), and wild goat (Capra aegagrus), which are of conservation importance. The mammal community found in the study sites was functionally diverse, including herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, seed dispersers, soil diggers, main preys, and top predators. The site burned 13 years ago had higher species richness than can be expected from a random pattern, but this was not the case in 30- and >40-year-old sites, showing the importance of relatively younger sites for large mammals. Eurasian badger had more probability to have more abundance in places with more open vegetation while wild goat had higher abundance in more dense vegetation. Young individuals of wild goat, brown bear, and wild boar were also detected in the study sites. The results indicate that burned habitats harbor a phylogenetically and functionally diverse large mammal community in landscapes originally dominated by Mediterranean pine forests. Therefore, these forests continue to retain importance for the large mammals after the fire, and burned habitats should be taken into consideration for the conservation and management plans together with mature forests in Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB The study focused on the behaviour of sit-and-wait antlion larvae in interspecific interactions. Antlion larvae usually occur in clusters with a high density of individuals; therefore, competition can be intense. We observed two abundant antlion species, E. nostras and M. formicarius, which co-occur in some habitats. In a simple habitat choice experiment where substrates differed according to sand particle size, we found that E. nostras exhibited dominance over M. formicarius. Most E. nostras larvae remained in the more suitable substrate and constructed pits, while all the M. formicarius larvae moved out of the suitable area, and did not build pits. In the second experiment, we observed the characteristics of the pit-fall traps and scored the occurrence of larval relocation in relation to interactions and in the control group, where larvae were kept in containers separately. In interactions, the larvae of E. nostras constructed smaller pits, but pit enlargement was greater in comparison to the control group. M. formicarius larvae constructed similar sized pits in both groups; however, enlargement was greater in the control group. Relocation of larvae occurred only during interactions. In direct interactions, we found 15 behavioural patterns, which are described in detail for the first time. In the presence of a competitor, larvae showed intense territorial behaviour. We recorded several behavioural patterns during larval confrontation, and interestingly, intraguild predation rarely occurred. In most cases, E. nostras larvae outcompete M. formicarius, which was evident from the larger pits and the rate of pit-construction.

AB Co-occurring species often compete with each other directly and indirectly. Intra-guild predation (IGP) is an extreme manifestation of direct competition, which involves the attack, killing and eating of potential competitors. We studied the competitive interactions between two pit-building antlion species that co-occur in the Israeli desert: Myrmeleon hyalinus residing in the more productive sandy soil, and Cueta lineosa solely inhabiting poorer loess soils. To understand the mechanisms driving C. lineosa away from the more productive habitat, we explored the factors triggering IGP of one antlion species on the other. We tested whether IGP is affected by soil type, depth and temperature. IGP was asymmetrical with M. hyalinus preying on C. lineosa, and it intensified as the size difference favoring the former increased. Interactive rather than additive effects governed IGP, which was lowest in sandy soil combined with low temperature, and highest in shallow loess soil. C. lineosa possesses a smaller head and thorax relative to its abdomen compared to M. hyalinus, providing a possible explanation for the advantage of M. hyalinus in direct competition. We then focused on the weaker competitor, C. lineosa, examining how it copes with competition induced by M. hyalinus. Both the growth and survival rates of C. lineosa declined in the presence of M. hyalinus. The asymmetrical IGP C. lineosa experiences from M. hyalinus combined with its competitive inferiority may explain why it is mostly found in poor habitats, while its intra-guild competitor is abundant in the more productive habitats.

AB This study was conducted to identify areas of endemism for Acantholimon species using parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and to detect endemic species richness of the genus in the region. The results obtained from the two methods used in this study were used in determining the priorities for the conservation of Acantholimon species in Iran. The distribution database of 62 endemic species belonging to this genus was formed by 1250 georeferenced observations in Iran. The study area was divided into 1 & x30a;x1 & x30a; grids of operative geographical units (OGUs) and the species x area matrix including presence/absence data was created. The endemic species richness was calculated using circular neighborhood with a radius of 50 km in 10 x 10 km(2) raster cells using DIVA-GIS software. The results of PAE analysis have shown four areas of endemism (AOEs) in Iran. AOE1: including Alborz and Zagros mountains, the mountains of central Iran. AOE2 and AOE3 are located in Khorassan subregion and AOE4 contains parts of western Iran. The map of endemic species richness indicated that the highest number of endemic species occurs in central Alborz region as well as Kerman, Chahar-Mahal and Bakhtiari, and Isfahan provinces.

ID BENEFITS; RISKS
AB Thousands of species worldwide are threatened with extinction due to human activities. For some animals, such as elephants, totoaba, and bluefin tuna, population declines are largely driven by hunting. High prices and large profits create a strong incentive for illegal hunting, even in the face of penalties and strict international restrictions against trade. One innovative solution to help reverse the declines of such species is to farm them to increase supply, thereby reducing prices and decreasing hunting incentives. However, this idea has been criticized as impractical, though some examples exist of successful implementation. Here, we evaluate the hurdles facing endangered species farming as a market-based mechanism to reduce illegal harvest of wild populations and provide guidance on when it is most likely to be effective. Using a simple model, we show how farming costs and enforcement of anti-poaching measures are key drivers of success for this solution. We also argue that many of the most promising candidates are aquatic species that have been largely overlooked. Thus, while conservation farming may not be a solution for all endangered species, it should be more seriously considered for species that could be produced quickly and cost-effectively.

AB The colonization by a large number of sea animals, including penguins and seals, plays an important role in the nitrogen cycle of the tundra ecosystem in coastal Antarctica. However, little is known about the effects of sea animal colonization on ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) communities involved in nitrogen transformations. In this study, we chose active seal colony tundra soils (SSs), penguin colony soils (PSs), adjacent penguin-lacking tundra soils (PLs), tundra marsh soils (MSs), and background tundra soils (BSs) to investigate the effects of sea animal colonization on the abundance, activity, and diversity of AOA and AOB in maritime Antarctica. Results indicated that AOB dominated over AOA in PS, SS, and PL, whereas AOB and AOA abundances were similar in MS and BS. Penguin or seal activities increased the abundance of soil AOB amoA genes but reduced the abundance of AOA amoA genes, leading to very large ratios (1.5 x 10(2) to 3.2 x 10(4)) of AOB to AOA amoA copy numbers. Potential ammonia oxidation rates (PAORs) were significantly higher (P = 0.02) in SS and PS than in PL, MS, and BS and were significantly positively correlated (P<0.001) with AOB amoA gene abundance. The predominance of AOB over AOA and their correlation with PAOR suggested that AOB play a more important role in the nitrification in animal colony soils. Sequence analysis for gene clones showed that AOA and AOB in tundra soils were from the Nitrososphaera and Nitrosospira lineages, respectively. Penguin or seal activities led to a predominance of AOA phylotypes related to Nitrososphaera cluster I and AOB phylotypes related to Nitrosospira clusters I and II but very low relative abundances in AOA phylotypes related to cluster II, and AOB phylotypes related to clusters III and IV. The differences in AOB and AOA community structures were closely related to soil biogeochemical processes under the disturbance of penguin or seal activities: soil C:N alteration and sufficient input of NH4+-N and phosphorus from animal excrements. The results significantly enhanced the understanding of ammonia-oxidizing microbial communities in the tundra environment of maritime Antarctica.

AB A few moderately long-term studies have documented population dynamics of the invasive Hemigrapsus sanguineus (Asian Shore Crab) and species with which it interacts. One such study on Cape Cod reported exponential growth of the Asian Shore Crab through 2012, concurrent with declines in 2 resident species, but recent data at nearby sites suggest considerable geographic variation in population dynamics, with modest recovery of resident crab populations. We monitored the Cape Cod population for an additional 5 years to determine whether population growth of the Asian Shore Crab had slowed and whether there was any change in population dynamics of Carcinus maenas (Green Crab), Littorina littorea (Common Periwinkle), or Mytilus edulis (Blue Mussel). Asian Shore Crab density declined by nearly 90% since 2012. There was no evidence of recovery by the Green Crab, but the Blue Mussel experienced a brief but substantial increase in density in 2015, when both crab species displayed >70% reductions in density from the previous year. The pattern of population dynamics of the Asian Shore Crab from 2003 to 2017 is consistent with boom-bust dynamics, but it remains unclear whether the population will equilibrate near its current density or undergo recurrent boom-bust cycles.

AB We set out to identify areas of endemism (AEs) among vascular plants in the Southern Cone of South America, using the genus Senecio (Asteraceae) as proxy. The use of a proxy allows a large-scale study to be carried out in a relatively short time and is suitable for pinpointing areas of interest for further investigation. Senecio is the most obvious choice for a proxy in the Southern Cone, because it is the most diverse genus in the region. We analysed the distribution of 200 endemic species using an optimality criterion (VNDM program). In general, endemism of Senecio in the Southern Cone forms 16 AEs that coincide with previously defined AEs and/or with distribution patterns also supported in phylogeographical studies. As such, Senecio appears to be a suitable proxy in endemicity studies, bearing in mind that these species are of young ages and therefore identify neoendemic AEs. Senecio distribution patterns in the Southern Cone corroborate that high Andean environments are prime sites for endemism, which peaks in the Cuyan High Andean AE, an AE that was not identified in previous endemism studies. Nevertheless, towards the south, the ecotone between the Patagonian Steppe and the Southern Andean forest becomes equally important for speciation.

AB Efficient community indices and indicators are crucial for the adequate management and design of measures ensuring the ecosystem integrity. In this study we analyse the shape, sign and strength of the response of some biotic integrity indices and indicators of structure and function of fish communities along geo-climatic and human pressures gradients at catchment scale. To that purpose,>300 sites all over the Iberian Peninsula were characterized at the catchment scale by means of two anthropogenic drivers (agricultural and urban land proportion) and seven natural environmental descriptors covering geographical and climatic aspects. Regarding to fish-based metrics, a set of the most frequently used in stream health assessment studies have been selected, including taxonomic classic indicators, size related indicators and also recent multimetric indices created in the European context (WFD). We applied boosted regression trees that allow estimating the sign and strength of the response as well as considering non-linearity and impact thresholds. Our results show that the jointly contribution of anthropic drivers was lower than geo-climatic drivers. For most of indices and indicators, one single land cover contributed more markedly to the total deviance explained than the other, and they responded rather consistently to land-use variables, i.e., most of them responded negatively to the increase of anthropic use in the catchment. Size diversity, Fish Region Index (FRI) and maximum weight were those more sensible to agriculture land, while EFI+, mean weight, distinctness and FRI were those more sensitive to urban land. Regarding the shape of the response, urban land proportion affects normally at extremely low values, while agriculture land proportion induces smoother changes on a wider range. Our results may have practical implications, such as the selection of an efficient array of fish-based metrics to be included in ecological assessment and monitoring programs.

AB Nacella magellanica is an edible limpet that has been consumed since pre-Hispanic times by human populations along the coasts of Patagonia, but studies of its nutritional value and reproduction are not yet available. We investigated the reproductive cycle and the seasonal variation in the nutritional composition (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) of the whole body of this limpet in order to analyse some aspects of its importance as a formal fishery resource. Throughout a single year, the spawning period extended over all months except June in males, while females spawned from late winter to spring, with an increase from August to November. The nutritional data obtained for N. magellanica are within the ranges of widely consumed species of molluscs, with annual average values of 29.8% proteins, 2.7% lipids and 1.8% carbohydrates. The best nutritional values for human consumption (highest concentration of proteins, body weight), avoiding the reproductive period, were found in April but taking into account the minimum size of capture. Our results are useful for increasing the policies aimed at managing this abundant edible limpet as a formal resource, since it is widely consumed in southern South America.

AB In Africa's pastoral conservation landscapes, apex predators frequently kill livestock. Retaliatory persecution such as poisoning threatens predators, but also non-target biota. Several factors influence conflict severity, including livestock husbandry, overlap in seasonal habitat use, and the degree to which livestock perceive and are able to respond to a landscape of fear. We investigated these factors by GPS-tracking 42 Tswana beef cattle (Bos taunts) from 29 herds in 2017 and six lions (Panthera leo) from different prides (May 2016-Dec. 2017) in the northern Okavango Delta, Botswana, where cattle depredation significantly impacts the livelihoods of rural agro-pastoralists. Cattle exhibited seasonal habitat selection patterns similar to wild ungulates in the region. They preferred woodland habitats, with more digestible grasses, during the wet season. During the dry season, they preferred wetland habitats with reliable forage and water availability. Cattle also preferred areas close to human settlements, but the necessity to forage in wetlands during the dry season exposed them to significant depredation risk, especially > 4 km from settlements. Lions killed most cattle in wetlands during the late dry season but the intensity of recent lion presence (previous 14 days) only had a weak negative effect on cattle habitat selection patterns. Cattle used rangelands according to nutritional requirements, irrelevant of the associated predation risk, suggesting that socio-ecologically acceptable conflict solutions cannot rely on the exclusion of livestock from seasonal wetlands. Curbing depredation by lions will best be achieved by a combination of resource- and predation-cognisant seasonal herding strategies with adequate livestock protection. Understanding the ecological constraints that intensify conflict is pertinent to any livestock production landscape with predator presence. It is also a central prerequisite for future land use planning and devolution of legal, controlled resource access rights through policy. Coexistence strategies must account for the strong reliance of people, their livestock, and wildlife on shared key resources. This is particularly important In large trans-frontier conservation areas where the successful merging of biodiversity conservation and rural development is a strategic goal. Omission will foster resentment and resistance to coexistence with apex predators, particularly if livestock productivity and human livelihoods are negatively affected.

AB The urban-rural dichotomy and the simple cause-effect relationship do not allow establishing specific criteria for territorial management from a socio-ecological perspective. The gradient approach could be a powerful tool to understand urban socio-ecological dynamics. This research applied a methodological protocol to obtain urban-rural gradients while considering the specific characteristics of a mid-size Andean city. To achieve this goal, a mixed classification process was applied to a Landsat 8 image. Subsequently, a factor analysis (FA) grouped 25 urbanisation variables. Finally, we applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering. FA established four factors that explained (72%) of the urbanisation metrics' variation. From this information, we obtained factor maps and a gradient map. The resulting map differentiated six gradients that contrast with the city's territorial planning based on the urban-rural dichotomy. This study is a starting point to apply the gradient approach in land-use management and urban ecology planning for Andean cities.

AB Human activities are causing a rapid loss of biodiversity, which impairs ecosystem functions and services. Therefore, understanding which processes shape how biodiversity is distributed along spatial and environmental gradients is a first step to guide conservation and management efforts. We aimed to determine the relative explanatory importance of biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial variables on assemblage dissimilarities and functional diversity of dung beetles along the Atlantic Forest-Pampa (i.e. forest-grassland) transition zone located in Southeast South America. We described each site according to their biogeographic position, environmental conditions, landscape features and spatial patterns. The compositional dissimilarity was partitioned into turnover and nestedness components of beta-diversity. Mantel tests and generalised dissimilarity models were used to relate beta-diversity and its components to biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial variables. Variation partitioning analysis was used to estimate the pure and shared variation in species composition and functional diversity explained by the four categories of predictors. Biome domain was the main factor causing dung beetle compositional dissimilarity, with a high species replacement between Atlantic Forest and Pampa. Biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial distances also affected the patterns of dung beetle dissimilarity and beta-diversity components. The shared effects of the four sets of predictors explained most of the variation in dung beetle composition. A similar response pattern was found for dung beetle functional diversity, which excluded biogeographic effects. Only the pure effects of environmental and spatial predictors were significant for species composition and functional diversity. Our results indicate that dung beetle species composition and functional diversity are jointly driven by environmental, landscape and spatial predictors with higher pure environmental and spatial effects. The forest-grassland transition zone promotes a strong species and trait replacement highly influenced both by environmental filtering and dispersal limitation.

AB Misali, an uninhabited islet along the east coast of Pemba Island off the mainland Tanzanian coast, is a biodiversity hotspot and Marine Protected Area (MPA), consisting of a core non-extraction zone (NEZ) surrounded by a larger area where some artisanal fishing is allowed. Within a year of receiving official protection under a co-management agreement, the island underwent a catastrophic bleaching event in 1998, and funding and enforcement in the protected area have been inconsistent since a restructuring of management in 2006. In this study, we investigate current health of the island's fish community, and report 186 observed fish species. We estimate that, including unseen species and those outside the study area, the total species richness may be comparable to the historical baseline of 244 species; however, this represents a decline from the 270 species estimated in 2001 and the 350 species observed in 2004, after several years of successful protections. Patterns of species richness over time likely reflect changes in management effectiveness and engagement of Misali's fishing communities. Diversity of indicator (Chaetodontidae) and keystone (Scarinae) taxa were comparable to historical levels and greatest inside the NEZ, suggesting continued reef health and resilience. However, we found no other significant differences between fish communities inside and outside the NEZ, which observations indicate is poorly enforced, and the disproportionate loss of large predatory fish species may indicate overfishing. The case study of Misali suggests that a temporary reduction in fishing pressure while the island was recovering from a severe bleaching event may have had long-lasting benefits for reef health and resilience. For future management, we recommend consideration of species-specific protections, a possible re-designation of NEZ boundaries to include more unique habitat types, and reintegration of local fishing communities into MPA co-management.

AB Rainfall and herbivory shape savannah herbaceous communities, but these disturbances are being altered globally. To assess potential consequences of such alterations, we evaluated herbivore effects on species and functional diversity during an episodic drought in a sodic savannah using data collected from long-term herbivore exclosures in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Herbaceous life forms are rarely acknowledged as distinct functional entities. Moreover, the functional ecology of forbs remains elusive. Here, we present disturbances-responses by forbs separately from grasses. We hypothesised that combinations of intense utilisation and drought would be associated with low diversity and high dominance at species and functional levels for both life forms. Contrary to our hypothesis, low forb and grass diversity was associated with long-term herbivore exclusion, which exceeded expected undesirable effects of intense utilisation and drought. Grasses responded less sensitively, suggesting that forbs respond dynamically to changes in herbivore assemblage when these alterations are combined with drought. Consistent with patterns in savannah systems, forbs contributed significantly to species and functional trait diversity. High forb diversity is suggested to enhance resilience of this nutrient-rich ecosystem against declines in its functioning when subjected to drought and alterations in herbivory.

AB Savannas make up about 20% of the global land-surface and are dependent on fires to maintain a balanced ecosystem. Fires in other fire-driven landscapes, particularly wildfires, were found to have negative effects on various soil properties. However, there is a lack of studies confirming the effect of fires on soil hydrology in African savanna soils. A long-term fire experiment in a South African savanna provided an opportunity to investigate the effect of different prescribed fire frequencies on soil properties in situ across coarse-grained granitic and fine-textured basalt-derived soils. Soil properties were compared between soils exposed to annual fires, fires every 2-4 years and where fires have been excluded for approximately 60 years. Across all three fire treatments, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) was measured using a Tension Disc Infiltrometer to infer infiltration rates, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) measured with a Guelph Permeameter, soil water potential calculated using a Decagon WP4-T Dewpoint Potentiometer to infer soil water retention and soil total C and N measured using a LECO CNS TruMac Series Analyser. Our study found that K-unsat is not affected by frequent annual fires which have infiltration rates similar to soils where fires have been excluded for nearly 6 decades. However, recently burnt granitic soils, i.e. three months prior, have significantly slower K-unsat which were as low as < 1 mm hr(-1) compared to a mean K-unsat of 30 mm hr(-1) on annually burnt soils, alluding to short term fire impacts on soil infiltration. Hence, we believe that time following a fire plays a greater role on K-unsat than fire frequency. Fires did not affect K-sat within the initial 2-5 cm of the soil surface. In general, the granitic soils had faster K-unsat and K-sat than the basaltic soils. Soil water potential, total C and N was significantly greater in the fire exclusion sites over both parent materials. Soil water and nutrient availability is critical in a post-fire environment to facilitate vegetation recovery in African savannas. These systems are resilient to fires which do not have long-term negative impacts on soil hydrology and nutrients, but instead increases the spatio-temporal variation in soil properties necessary in maintaining savanna heterogeneity.

AB In tropical Africa, evidence of widely distributed genera transcending biomes or habitat boundaries has been reported. The evolutionary processes that allowed these lineages to disperse and adapt into new environments are far from being resolved. To better understand these processes, we propose an integrated approach, based on the eco-physio-morphological traits of two sister species with adjacent distributions along a rainfall gradient. We used wood anatomical traits, plant hydraulics (vulnerability to cavitation, wood volumetric water content, and hydraulic capacitance), and growth data from the natural habitat, in a common garden, to compare species with known phylogeny, very similar morphologically, but occupying contrasting habitats: Erythrophleum ivorense (wet forest) and Erythrophleum suaveolens (moist forest and forest gallery). We identified some slight differences in wood anatomical traits between the two species associated with strong differences in hydraulics, growth, and overall species distribution. The moist forest species, E. suaveolens, had narrower vessels and intervessel pits, and higher vessel cell-wall reinforcement than E. ivorense. These traits allow a high resistance to cavitation and a continuous internal water supply of the xylem during water shortage, allowing a higher fitness during drought periods, but limiting growth. Our results confirm a trade-off between drought tolerance and growth, controlled by subtle adaptations in wood traits, as a key mechanism leading to the niche partitioning between the two Erythrophleum species. The generality of this trade-off and its importance in the diversification of the African tree flora remains to be tested. Our integrated eco-physio-morpho approach could be the way forward.

AB Abalone (Haliotis spp.) populations are in decline due to overfishing and/or disease in all regions that historically supported important fisheries worldwide. Two species have been federally listed as Endangered in the USA. Recovery plans for these and other highly depleted species typically include outplanting of progeny from capfive-reared broodstock, for which maintaining good health is essential to promote gonad development and maturation. In California, USA, the principal disease of concern for abalone is withering syndrome, caused by a gastrointestinal intracellular Rickettsiales-like prokaryote named Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis (Ca.Xc). We report the application of an antibiotic bath exposure method to eliminate the pathogen in captive red abalone (H. rufescens) populations. A series of eight, 24-h baths consisting of 500 ppm oxytetracycline in sea-water were delivered over a period of 21 days. Testing of feces by PCR and histology indicated complete elimination of Ca.Xc by day 105 following the first bath treatment. Mean oxytetracycline levels in the digestive gland reached a peak of 670 ppm at the end of the treatment period and remained above 100 ppm for 125 days. Survival rate, body condition index, growth and a measure of foot muscle health were similar between treated and control groups, despite tetracyclines being potentially toxic or immunosuppressive in some animal systems. This method should prove useful for creating Ca.Xc specific-pathogen-free captive abalone populations for land-based production and to prevent pathogen transfer when abalone are introduced to growing regions where the pathogen is not present.

AB Litter decomposition is an ecosystem function essential for nutrient cycling; however until very recently it was considered of minor importance within the fire-prone Fynbos Biome. To investigate decomposition rate and litter nutrient dynamics, litterbags containing materials from three plant species from different functional types were placed in sites across a degradation gradient and over two seasons. Litterbags were removed after three and six months for both seasons to determine decomposition rates and change in nutrient concentration. Decomposition varied greatly among the species and was strongly correlated to initial nutrient values of the litter. The most nutrient rich litter type, the alien herbaceous Medicago spp., lost 65% of its original mass after six months while the most nutrient poor, the indigenous grass Pentameris eriostoma, lost 18%. Litter from Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis, an indigenous shrub, lost 27% of its original mass. For all litter types, the majority of the loss occurred during the first three months of the experiment. Season was found to significantly affect litter decomposition; however the exact mechanism behind this is unclear. Degradation level, at least defined by the metrics of this study, did not significantly affect litter decomposition rate. The faster decomposition rate shown in Medicago spp. suggests that in degraded areas where significant proportions of the species invade, nutrient cycling will be accelerated in comparison to pristine land; however broadening the species of study to include additional plant functional types, such as indigenous annuals, would help give insight into this hypothesis. This study affirms the notion that litter decomposition is an important ecosystem function within the Fynbos Biome with litter type acting as a strong controlling variable. (C) 2018 SAAB.

AB Mumiyo deposits form in the vicinity of snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea) nesting sites and consist of fossil stomach oil (mumiyo), guano, and minerogenic material. Here we evaluate mumiyo deposits from the inland mountain ranges of central Dronning Maud Land as high-resolution archives for paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Antarctica. Investigation of internal structures and chemical composition shows that the lamination reflects progressive sedimentation, despite the irregular outer morphology of the deposits. Detailed radiocarbon analysis demonstrates that stratigraphies are intact: C-14 ages become successively younger upwards in the deposits. Fatty acid and n-alcohol composition was determined on samples from eight mumiyo deposits. Dominance of low molecular weight compounds (C-14 to C-18) points to a dietary signal; however, the relatively low proportions of unsaturated compounds compared to fresh stomach oils indicates some postdepositional degradation. We found marine diatoms in the mumiyo, which potentially provide a proxy for sea ice conditions in the foraging habitat of the petrels. Age ranges of the investigated deposits suggest occupation of the analyzed sites by snow petrels from 17 ka to > 58 ka. Changes in deposition rates point to higher occupation frequency in Petermann Range from 46 to 42 ka compared to the late marine isotope stage 3 and the Last Glacial Maximum.

AB Maintaining sustainable ecosystems are important for all the inhabitants of earth. Also, an important component of sustainable ecosystems is the maintenance of healthy coexistence of consumers and their resources which can include diseases in the species involved. We formulate a model, where the resources are plants, to explore how consumer-resource coexistence could of itself limit the spread of infectious diseases. The important mathematical features of the model are discussed using the basic reproduction number and the consumption number. The results show an association between species coexistence and a decrease in ecosystem resource disease. The possible importance of these results are discussed.

AB Strip mining in arid ecosystems causes extreme ecological destruction that may take decades to recover. The present study examined the effect of different plant-community rehabilitation treatments on arthropods after strip mining in the arid Namaqualand region of South Africa. Vegetation cover and plant species richness were significantly lower at all rehabilitated sites compared with those at a reference site. Arthropod species richness did not differ amongst the different treatments and the reference site. Except for the most recently rehabilitated site, arthropod abundance in all guilds was higher at all treatments compared with that of the reference site. Overall arthropod abundance was positively correlated to plant cover and negatively correlated to plant species richness, but these vegetation characteristics had no effect on arthropod species richness. This may be explained by a high cover of pioneer plants at the rehabilitated sites, which offer ample food for generalist arthropod taxa. Arthropod community composition differed significantly between treatments. We demonstrate that rehabilitation of ecosystem function after mining in arid systems is a lengthy process, even after implementation of intensive rehabilitation protocols. We also show that arthropod communities provide additional insights into the level of ecosystem recovery otherwise obscured when only considering plant community data.

AB Tree invasion has the potential to negatively affect biodiversity and ecosystems, with invasive alien trees (IATs) expanding widely in protected areas (PAs) across different habitats. Thus, the effectiveness of PAs might be reduced. Investigation of the distributions of IAT is urgently required to improve the effective conservation management of PAs. We projected the potential distributions of 10 IATs, which included Acacia mearnsii, Ardisia elliptica, Cecropia peltata, Cinchona pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Melaleuca quinquenervia, Miconia calvescens, Morella faya, Prosopis glandulosa, and Spathodea campanulata, that have a serious influence on global biodiversity and assessed the distribution possibilities of these IATs in PAs based on the PA categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The overall potential distributions of these 10 IATs included Latin America, central and southern Africa, southeastern Asia, eastern Australia and New Zealand, and western Europe. Annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, and soil bulk density were found to be important environmental variables for the potential distributions of these IATs. Overall, A. mearnsii, A. elliptica, C. peltata, L. leucocephala, M. quinquenervia, M. calvescens, and S. campanulata were distributed mainly in the IUCN PA categories of national parks and PAs with sustainable use of natural resources. We proposed the following for conservation management of PAs: (1) completion of species inventories for PAs, (2) better understanding of factors driving invasions in PAs, (3) assessment of the efficiency of management within particular PAs, and (4) evaluation of changes in trends regarding plant invasions in PAs under climate change conditions.

AB Organisms evolve to maintain fitness across generations, while short-term fitness in stochastic habitats such as temporary wetlands may be highly varied. As typical temporary wetland inhabitants, large branchiopods rely on bet hedging hatching that helps them survive throughout generations. An optimal hatching rate is predicted to be approximate to the successful reproduction probability (SRP). We tested the difference between hatching rate and SRP of large branchiopods Branchinella kugenumaensis and Eulimnadia braueriana in a temporary wetland in Taiwan, through field surveys and climatic records to evaluate their SRP. Comparisons were performed under two proposed scenarios, where a population's hatching was bet hedged for a hydroperiod or for a wet season (with several hydroperiods), respectively. Population size fluctuations were simulated for these two scenarios under assumed egg mortalities and reproductive replenishments. Results showed that the hatching rates only fitted to SRP for E. braueriana under the scenario of bet hedging on a wet season, not for B. kugenumaensis, nor for both species under the scenario of bet hedging on a hydroperiod. Bet hedging on a wet season would have a smaller range of population size fluctuation and a lower rate of population size decrease. This implies that large branchiopods adopt a conservative hatching strategy, lowering the hatching fraction in each hydroperiod to reduce long-term egg bank size fluctuation. Bet hedging strategies could occur during other life cycle stages, coexist with other life history strategies, and lead to the diversified hatching fraction distribution rather than a single, optimal fraction throughout hydroperiods.

AB The degradation, alteration and depletion of riparian habitats caused by river regulation are among critical conservation concerns. Aquatic and riparian habitats support not only river-dwelling biota such as macroinvertebrates and fish, but also waterbirds, the top predators in the aquatic food web. Despite the intimate relationships between fish and waterbirds, the two groups are often investigated separately. Using an integrative approach, we examined the effects of dams on fish and scaly-sided merganser (Mergus squamatus), an endangered, iconic riverine species, where the lack of knowledge about habitat preferences greatly hampers long-term conservation efforts. Our analysis quantified three causal links: (1) water depth had direct, comparable, negative effects on both fish and waterbirds, and the path coefficients for fish and birds are -0.31 and -0.46, respectively; (2) river landscape heterogeneity directly and positively affected fish and waterbirds, and the path coefficients for fish and birds are 0.63 and 0.19, respectively; and (3) depth and river landscape also exerted indirect effects on waterbirds through their impacts on fish abundance, and the path coefficients for fish and birds are -0.15 and 0.28, respectively. Our findings could contribute to the rational spatial planning and sustainable operation of dams in that maintaining instream habitat availability and heterogeneity would benefit the whole riverine ecosystem.

AB The population genetic structure of toheroa (Paphies ventricosa), an Aotearoa (New Zealand) endemic surf clam, was assessed to determine levels of inter-population connectivity and test hypotheses regarding life history, habitat distribution and connectivity in coastal vs. estuarine taxa. Ninety-eight toheroa from populations across the length of New Zealand were sequenced for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene with analyses suggesting a population genetic structure unique among New Zealand marine invertebrates. Toheroa genetic diversity was high in Te Ika-a Maui (the North Island of New Zealand) but completely lacking in the south of Te Waipounamu (the South Island), an indication of recent isolation. Changes in habitat availability, long distance dispersal events or translocation of toheroa to southern New Zealand by Maori could explain the observed geographic distribution of toheroa and their genetic diversity. Given that early-Maori and their ancestors, were adept at food cultivation and relocation, the toheroa translocation hypothesis is plausible and may explain the disjointed modern distribution of this species. Translocation would also explain the limited success in restoring what may in some cases be ecologically isolated populations located outside their natural distributions and preferred niches.

AB Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) are known to suppress populations of small mammals in African savanna ecosystems; whether this suppression is driven by depletion of nutrients and food resources, or of cover, is poorly understood. Cattle management creates scattered, persistent, nutrient-enriched areas (glades). Similarly, prescribed fire may enhance forage nutrition of burned patches. Both enriched microhabitats attract wild and domestic LMH and are fertilized by their wastes, but removal of vegetative cover by LMH or fire may negate the benefits of enhanced nutrition to risk-averse small-mammal species or individuals. We used replicated LMH exclusion experiments on red sandy loam and black-cotton clay soils, and a multi-scale burn experiment on black cotton to examine abundance, diversity, and biomass of small mammals across sites varying in vegetation cover and enrichment. Small-mammal species composition varied dramatically among habitats. Species diversity and density on red sands were roughly double that of black cotton soils. Small-mammal densities and diversity were dramatically greater inside LMH exclosures; maximal densities occurred inside fenced, nutrient-rich, tall-grass glades. Small-mammal density was similar between black-cotton burn sites and unburned matrix habitat but was significantly greater on unburned than burned patches within the burn sites. Burned patches contained less grassy cover up to 50 months post-burn, although vegetation differences diminished following significant rains. Mice captured on burned patches traveled farther but were not heavier than mice captured on unburned patches. Small mammals were nearly 20-fold more abundant on totally fenced glades than matrix habitat on both soils and ninefold more abundant on fenced bushland (non-glades) on red sands. Unfenced glades supported intermediate densities in black cotton but lower densities in red sands because of close cropping by LMH. Total small-mammal biomass tended to be greater on red sands (though mean body mass was greater on black cotton for two common species), within exclosures, and on glades. Both the grass rat and pouched mouse reached maximal densities within glade LMH exclosures on both soils. This and the positive association of small-mammal densities with grass height and dead-stem density suggest loss of cover is a primary driver of large-herbivore suppression of certain savanna small mammals.

AB Sympatric plant species that flower at the same time in highly seasonal environments are subject to competitive interference. Many species of the genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae) are sympatric and have an aggregated flowering period, which may have a strong influence on interactions among these species and their pollinators. We assessed the strategies of sympatric species of Psychotria to segregate or share pollinators, and the consequences for intra- and interspecific pollen flow. We sampled pollinators and analyzed flowering phenology, floral tube length, pollinator tongue length and floral nectar production of three sympatric species of Psychotria in the understory of a tropical forest in Brazil. We also marked flowers with fluorescent powder to monitor the flow of pollen. The studied species of Psychotria exhibited a short synchronous flowering period, with the sharing of pollinators and interspecific pollen exchange. The prevalence of shared or unshared pollinators and of intra- or interspecific pollen exchange varied among the studied species. Variation in floral tube length and nectar was not enough to hamper the sharing of most pollinators and pollen flow between Psychotria nitidula and P. hoffinannseggiana. Non-shared pollinators were more common in flowers of P. prunifolia, probably due to its longer floral tube, which can impede the access of shared pollinators. The higher offer of floral nectar by P. prunifolia makes this species more attractive to a greater number of flower visitors. Pollinator sharing seems to have no negative effect on intraspecific pollen flow and on the reproductive success of the studied synchronopatric species of Psychotria.

AB The prey choices of predators are determined, in part, by their hunting strategies. The sit-and-wait and the actively searching strategies seem designed for active and stationary prey, respectively. A supposedly intermediate strategy, the saltatory or sit-and-move strategy, combines sitting still, scanning for prey with frequent moves to new scanning sites. We tested the hypothesis that the spontaneous movements of predators, i.e. activity performed in constant conditions in the laboratory, reflect their hunting strategy. We compared the crab spider Xysticus cristatus (sit-and-wait), the sac spider Clubiona phragmitis (active hunting) and the wolf spider Pardosa amentata (sit-and-move). We used automatic video tracking throughout 6 h during both light and dark conditions to quantify movement parameters: time in movement/rest; total distance moved, maximal velocity; mean velocity during movement; number of stops, longest rest period; and turn rate and turn bias. Xysticus and Clubiona confirmed predictions, but Pardosa showed a combination of movement parameters that was not intermediate between the other two. We suggest the existence of a sit-and-wait/sit-and-move continuum with varying proportions of sitting and moving, characterized by scanning for prey from a resting position, whereas the active searching strategy is distinct owing to detection of prey while the predator is moving.

AB Most studies suggest that multiple factors are responsible for woody plant encroachment, but are inconclusive on its causes. Woody plant encroachment is modified by local patterns of disturbance, topography, soil texture and fertility, and their relative importance and interaction strength varies among locations. We used grassland communities, Carletonville Dolomite Grassland (CDG), Rand Highveld Grassland (RHG) and abiotic factors (Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Total nitrogen (TN), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg) and pH) to investigate habitat preferences of Seriphium plumosum L. in South African semi-arid grassland. Grassland community had a significant effect on S. plumosum density, canopy size, and on components of soil fertility (P<0.05). Slope position had a significant effect on S. plumosum density and canopy size (P< 0.05). Seriphium plumosum density was significantly lower (23 plants/50 m(2) +/- 2.39 (SE)) in CDG than in RHG (40 plants/50 m(2) +/- 4.19). By contrast, S. plumosum canopy size was significantly higher (1.39 m(2) +/- 0.11) at CDG than at the RHG (1.06 m(2) +/- 0.08). The interaction of grassland community and slope position had a significant effect on S. plumosum density and soil sodium content (P< 0.05). Bottom slope regions in RHG (59.00 plants/50 m(2) +/- 8.62) had higher S. plumosum density than bottom slope regions (19.75 plants/50 m(2) +/- 3.01) in CDG. Soil sodium content was similar in CDG slopes and higher than in RHG slopes. Seriphium plumosum density was positively related to components of soil fertility; P (r(2) = 0.1270; P 0.0036), K (r(2) = 0.0786; P 0.0237), Na (r(2) = 0.0686; P 0.0350), Ca (r(2) = 0.0681; P 0.0358), and SOC content (r(2) = 0.0669; P 0.0374). However, Seriphium plumosum canopy size did not show any relationship with components of soil fertility. This study revealed that S. plumosum density in grassland communities increased with increasing soil texture and fertility.

AB The reproductive phenology of tropical plants is potentially driven by a number of abiotic and biotic factors. However, it is still unclear as to which climatic factors and biotic interactions drive the reproductive phenology of woody trees in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region in Southwest China. We conducted observations on woody plants (including trees and shrubs) phenology between November 2004 and October 2007 at biweekly intervals in the one hectare permanent plot of tropical seasonal rainforest in Southwest China. A total of 357 individuals of 76 species (70 genera, 37 families), comprising of 59 (78%) woody trees and 17 (22%) shrub species were observed. Our results demonstrate that flowering and fruiting frequencies show slight temporal variation between years. Flowering was significantly correlated with day-length, temperature and rainfall and fruiting was significantly correlated with rainfall and temperature. This finding indicates that woody tree reproductive phenology was primarily associated with temperature and rainfall and to a lesser extent with day-length. Reproductive phenology is also linked to seasonal patterns with flowering peaking in the late dry season and fruiting peaking in the late wet season. Moreover, reproductive phenology is also significantly associated with reproductive ecological guilds such as pollination types and dispersal modes. Community reproductive phenology is associated with climatic seasonality and biotic interactions. It also suggests that seasonal phenology patterns may play a fundamental role in community reproductive success in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region of Southwest China.

AB Urbanized landscapes are the theater of multiple simultaneous biological invasions likely to affect spread dynamics when co-occurring introduced species interact with each other. Interactions between widespread invaders call for particular attention because they are likely to be common and because non-additive outcomes of such associations might induce negative consequences (e.g., enhanced population growth increasing impacts or resistance to control). We explored the invasions of two widespread invasive taxa: the Japanese knotweed species complex Fallopia spp. and the invasive garden ant Lasius neglectus, in the urban area of Lyon (France). First, we investigated landscape habitat preferences as well as co-occurrence rates of the two species. We showed that Fallopia spp. and L. neglectus had broadly overlapping environmental preferences (measured by seven landscape variables), but their landscape co-occurrence pattern was random, indicating independent spread and non-obligatory association. Second, as Fallopia spp. produce extra-floral nectar, we estimated the amount of nectar L. neglectus used under field conditions without ant competitors. We estimated that L. neglectus collected 150-321 kg of nectar in the month of April (when nectar production is peaking) in a 1162 m(2) knotweed patch, an amount likely to boost ant population growth. Finally, at six patches of Fallopia spp. surveyed, herbivory levels were low (1-6% loss of leaf surface area) but no relationship between ant abundance (native and invasive) and loss of leaf surface was found. Co-occurrences of Fallopia spp. and L. neglectus are likely to become more common as both taxa colonize landscapes, which could favor the spread and invasion success of the invasive ant.

AB Contemporary multivariate statistics were used to test the hypotheses that the dietary compositions of three populations of labrids on the west Australian coast are related to body size and undergo seasonal changes and to elucidate the relative extents and basis for any dietary differences within and between those populations. Gut content analyses determined the dietary compositions of Choerodon rubescens in marine waters of the outer reefs in the World Heritage Area of Shark Bay (26 degrees S; 114 degrees E) and of Choerodon schoenleinii in inner protected reefs of that large embayment. The dietary compositions of C. rubescens and C. schoenleinii differed significantly among length classes, progressed serially with increasing body size, both overall and almost invariably in each season and were more closely related to body size than season, whose effect was at best minimal. The size-related dietary change in C. rubescens involved, in particular, a shift from crustaceans and non-mytilid bivalves to mytilid bivalves and echinoid echinoderms. Although the diet of C. schoenleinii followed similar size-related changes, it contained a greater volume of gastropods when the fish were small and mytilids when large and only a small volume of echinoids. The dietary composition of C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands, 300 km to the south of Shark Bay, was related both to length class and season and differed from that of this labrid in Shark Bay with the ingestion of lesser volumes of mytilids and greater volumes of echinoids. The size-related changes in diet imply that these species shift from foraging over soft substrata to over reefs as their very well-developed jaws become sufficiently strong to remove attached and larger prey. The dietary compositions of C. rubescens and C. schoenleinii in Shark Bay and of C. rubescens at the Abrolhos Islands were related far more to habitat-locational differences than to length class and season. The above intraspecific and interspecific differences in diet are consistent with qualitative accounts of the relative abundances of the main prey in their respective environments, supporting the view that, despite specializations in their feeding apparatus, these labrids can feed opportunistically to a certain extent and could thus potentially respond to moderate changes in the composition of their prey caused by climate change and other anthropogenic effects.

AB Plantations with alien forest species could be a major way for invasive plant and animal species to become introduced and naturally established in a territory, but the sensitivity of plantations with native forest species to invasive plant and animal species is still unknown. This paper studies the probability of the presence and the richness of invasive species of three different taxa (plants, birds, and mammals) in pine forests of southwestern Europe. To do so, the relative contribution from natural and planted forests is analysed to explain the presence and the richness of invasive species in 3950 cells (10 km x 10 km) covering Spain after controlling for the possible effects of variables related to geography, climate, land use, landscape, and human pressure on the environment. Our results show that man's influence on the establishment of invasive species is notable. However, those forests that are the most intensely managed by man, such as pine plantations with native species, seem less susceptible to the establishment and propagation of invasive species. Reasons may be found in those planted pine forests being closely monitored, controlled, and managed by man. Therefore, it is argued that efforts related to the early warning systems of invasive species should be focused on natural pine forests.

AB One colony of the snowflake coral Carijoa riisei (Alcyonacea: Clavulariidae) was found in June 2016, and three more in January 2017, during dives in the port of Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico (Tropical Eastern Pacific). This species was considered as native to the tropical Western Atlantic and invasive in the Pacific, but recent studies suggest that it is native to the Indo-West Pacific. Colonies were found and collected from artificial substrates in the port. A total of 29 species of invertebrates of five different phyla were associated with the colonies of C. riisei. Moreover, the octocoral was found as an epibiont on the architect crab Pelia tumida. Our observations suggest that the invasion of C. riisei in Manzanillo is in an early stage and that on-going monitoring and implementation of an eradication plan is necessary before its distribution is increased.

AB Zooplankton generally distributes patchily. Distributional patchiness could be adaptive to survival and reproduction, especially for large branchiopods that live in temporary pools with variable aquatic environments. We focused on spatial utilization by three sympatric large branchiopods in a subtropical temporary pool (Siangtian Pond, northern Taiwan): Branchinella kugenumaensis (Ishikawa, 1895) (Anostraca), Eulimnadia braueriana Ishikawa, 1895 (Spinicaudata), and Lynceus biformis (Ishikawa, 1895) (Laevicaudata). Sampling along transects were conducted across four hydroperiods. The number of adults for each species was recorded to describe patchiness, edge aggregation, and hotspots of peak density. We found that the three species showed patchy distribution, which could reflect resource heterogeneity. Only B. kugenumaensis consistently aggregated toward the edge, and we hypothesize that this distributional tendency correlates with mating behavior. Hotspots of L. biformis were concentrated in the deepest locations, possibly due to late maturation and limited utilization area available for adults. In contrast, the early-maturing E. braueriana was scattered widely throughout the basin without an obvious pattern. Patchy distribution could be a common phenomenon for large branchiopods in temporary pools, whereas species-specific distribution patterns depend on multiple factors.

AB The Acacia drepanolobium (also known as Vachellia drepanolobium) ant-plant symbiosis is considered a classic case of species coexistence, in which four species of tree-defending ants compete for nesting space in a single host tree species. Coexistence in this system has been explained by trade-offs in the ability of the ant associates to compete with each other for occupied trees versus the ability to colonize unoccupied trees. We seek to understand the proximal reasons for how and why the ant species vary in competitive or colonizing abilities, which are largely unknown. In this study, we use RADseq-derived SNPs to identify relatedness of workers in colonies to test the hypothesis that competitively dominant ants reach large colony sizes due to polygyny, that is, the presence of multiple egg-laying queens in a single colony. We find that variation in polygyny is not associated with competitive ability; in fact, the most dominant species, unexpectedly, showed little evidence of polygyny. We also use these markers to investigate variation in mating behavior among the ant species and find that different species vary in the number of males fathering the offspring of each colony. Finally, we show that the nature of polygyny varies between the two commonly polygynous species, Crematogaster mimosae and Tetraponera penzigi: in C.mimosae, queens in the same colony are often related, while this is not the case for T.penzigi. These results shed light on factors influencing the evolution of species coexistence in an ant-plant mutualism, as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of RADseq-derived SNPs for parentage analysis.

AB Zooarchaeological faunal remains are commonly examined to investigate harvesting behavior. We determined limpet (Patella vulgata) shell size and shape, and estimated shell age from several middens at the Late Norse Sandwick South Site, Unst, Shetland, UK, whose strata represent distinct occupational phases (Phase 1: AD 1100-1200, Phase 2: AD 1200-1250, Phase 3: AD 1250-1350). Our goal was to determine if the many limpets found there could provide insight into Norse harvesting behavior. Shell length, conicity, and modeled age all declined between Phases 1 and 2, suggesting intensive, size-selective harvesting of limpets and a shift to harvesting lower in the intertidal zone between phases. Length and conicity varied in Phases 2 and 3 and no major changes seem to have occurred over these periods, indicating that harvesting maintained the limpet population at an impacted level throughout the later phases. The conicity decline between Phases 1 and 2 may also have been caused by increased storminess that accompanied the onset of the Little Ice Age. The mean length of modern limpet populations near the Norse site did not differ from the archaeological phases, but did vary among collection years. Limpets were 26% larger in 2015 than in 2012 and 2013, indicating that large interannual variations in population structure can occur over short time periods. Potentially the result of extreme storms removing small limpets, this result raises the possibility that size and conicity changes during the Sandwick South Site occupation, as well as in other early populations, could also be the result of environmental factors rather than human harvesting alone. We feel, however, that the most parsimonious explanation for the patterns we document is human harvesting.

AB The expanding economical activities have accelerated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services, which are especially pronounced in Asia. To find solutions to stop these losses, a group of scientists studying both ecological and social sciences has launched an interdisciplinary research network, entitled TSUNAGARI (Trans-System, UNified Approach for Global and Regional Integration of social-ecological study toward sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services). The project is based on two main perspectives: (1) integrating different disciplines of environmental research across multiple spatial scales, and (2) evaluating the importance of ecosystem connectivity between land and ocean for biodiversity and ecosystem services. The integrative studies have been started as follows: (1) integrating global-scale analyses of biodiversity and economy by developing GIS-based footprint analysis, (2) establishing the link between the studies of local good practices of ecosystem management and life cycle assessment on ecosystem good and services, (3) linking local-scale ecosystem studies to decision making processes for sustainable society by multiple stakeholders, and (4) upscaling local analyses of ecosystem processes to broad-scale analyses of ecosystem patterns. The proposed approaches are considered effective to solve problems that impede conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of multiple ecosystem services in various situations although we also find some gaps such as regional biases in biodiversity data and involvement of different types of stakeholders. By overcoming the major bottlenecks, we believe the new integrated approaches will promote conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystem services research, and contribute to advance decision-making processes from local communities to international levels.

AB Comparison of highly successful and less successful invasive species can highlight traits that are associated with invasion success, and indicate the associated risk of further establishment or invasion from novel species. We compared variation in delta C-13 and delta N-15, or isotopic niche, in the tissues of matched pairs of highly successful and less successful (respectively) freshwater and marine aquatic invasive species: violet tunicate Botrylloides violaceus and golden star tunicate Botryllus schlosseri from the northwest Atlantic coast; spiny waterflea Bythotrephes longimanus and fishhook waterflea Cercopagis pengoi from the Great Lakes basin; and Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica from the northeast Pacific coast. Individual (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and population (Bayesian ellipses of delta C-13 and delta N-15) level comparisons of isotopic niche revealed, in most cases, greater niche breadth in the more successful species of tunicate but the less successful species of waterflea and oyster. Comparison with the literature suggested that a broad dietary niche is less crucial for widespread distribution of aquatic invasive invertebrates than it is for vertebrates (i.e., fishes). Inconsistency in the association between isotopic niche breadth and invasion success could be due to a greater influence of habitat suitability on variation in invertebrate diets. These findings challenge the common assumption that a broader niche promotes invasion success, and thus, have implications for invasive species risk assessment, management, and our understanding of species spread and distribution.

AB Stable isotope analysis is a widespread tool in ecological studies of diet composition and habitat use. In deserts, freshwater environments constitute threatened local hotspots of biodiversity. In these environments, stable isotopes may help to describe trophic ecology of top-predators. We examined stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes from scute keratin samples of 33 Crocodylus suchus and muscle samples from 39 potential prey collected in Southern Mauritania. Isotope ratios were compared among crocodiles according to size (non-adult and adult), and habitat (rock pools and floodplains). There was a significant interaction effect of habitat and size on crocodile delta C-13 values. Whereas delta C-13 was similar for all crocodiles collected in rock pools, adults had lower signatures than non-adults in seasonal floodplains. delta N-15 indicated an ontogenetic dietary shift with adult crocodiles foraging on prey from higher trophic level. Standard ellipse areas showed wider isotopic niches for adult than non-adult crocodiles, and within adults, for those from floodplains than those from rock pools. These environments are small, seasonal, overexploited for livestock watering, and polluted. They support very small and isolated crocodile populations. This study is aimed to provide conservation authorities with baseline information to strictly protect water-bodies where these predators subsist in arid environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Residual circulation from nonlinear interaction of the tidal currents with topography in channels, fjords and bays can be important to represent the distance traveled by suspended materials in the water column (e.g. pathogens). Here the role of the semidiurnal tidal excursion was compared with residual currents, during autumn 2011, to evaluate the connectivity among aquaculture production centers in Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which has been widely occupied by the aquaculture industry. During 2015, around 30 000 t of 3 different species of salmon were harvested in this channel, representing 3.7 % of the national production. Along- and cross-channel tidal currents explained around 80 and 40-60% of the total variance, respectively. Thus, the major residual circulation came from the cross-channel component (40-60% of the total variance) caused by tidal asymmetry. We hypothesized that this asymmetry is related to the nonlinear interaction of the oscillatory flow with the Quemchi constriction. The residual advective distances (L-adv) were compared with tidal excursion (L-exc) and biological diffusivity (L-diff) scales, considering the distances between centers (L-int), the size of the centers (L-cen) and the length of the south arm of the Cauchaue Channel (L = 11 km). For 3 d time scales, the L-adv/L-exc ratio fluctuated between 1.3 and 8, approximately, implying that, although the advective scale is greater, the tidal flow is still intense enough to favor the retention of pathogens. For larger time scales that consider longer-lived pathogens (e.g. greater than 15 d), this ratio grows 1 order of magnitude. In this scenario and in the event of an outbreak within the channel, pathogens could be exported.

AB The growth in world trade has generated significant benefits to humankind, but it has also generated costs. Among these is an increase in the dispersal of pests and pathogens across the globe. International trade has been implicated in outbreaks of several re-occurring livestock diseases. This paper is focused on the risk of foot and mouth disease (FMD) associated with the international trade in live animals. A model was used to estimate FMD risk as a function of the international trade in live animals, controlling for the biosecurity measures undertaken by importing and exporting countries, and for the presence of endemic FMD reservoirs. It was found that the indirect risks associated with exports may be as great as the direct risks associated with imports. For countries where livestock production occurs in disease-free zones (with or without vaccination), the trade risks vary with both species and trading partner. These findings may assist the targeting of disease risk mitigation activities.

AB Intensive, large-scale cultivation of food crops has led to major biodiversity loss worldwide due to fragmentation and degradation of remnant semi-natural habitat within agro-ecosystems. The response of vegetation to these disturbances is often measured in terms of taxonomic diversity loss. However, some plant groups may have more pronounced negative reactions to agricultural disturbance than others, which may not necessarily be expressed in the overall species diversity of the community. It is now widely accepted that the responses of plant taxa to environmental disturbances may be more directly linked to characteristics or traits that enable or hinder their persistence in disturbed environments. This highlights the need to assess the impacts of agricultural disturbance on the abundance patterns and diversity of specific plant traits and functional types. Maize agriculture is a common land-use feature in the grassy biomes of South Africa, but the effect that crop production has on surrounding semi-natural vegetation is still relatively unknown. In this study, we describe the specific functional trait patterns of plant communities associated with maize agro-ecosystems in six localities situated within the Grassland and Savanna biomes of South Africa. Although functional diversity was severely decreased in maize fields, marginal vegetation (30-100mfromcrop field edges) displayed no indication of functional diversity loss or major changes in trait composition. Chamaephytic and hemicryptophytic (perennial) life forms, nitrogen-fixing ability and spinescence were trait attributes that were most frequently found in semi-natural vegetation but were lost in the crop field environment. Inside the maize fields, these trait attributes were replaced by annual, low-growing individuals with clonal parts and long-range dispersal mechanisms that can establish in the ephemeral crop field environment. Observed patterns were different for grassland and savanna maize fields, indicating that maize fields situated in the Grassland and Savanna biomes favoured different plant trait assemblages.

AB Although it has long been recognized that the diversified sexual systems of plants could influence community patterns and pollination specialization, plant sex is not usually incorporated to quantify plant-pollinator networks. In this study, we observed 1776 visitations corresponding to 84 pollinator species and 28 plant species (19 sexually monomorphic plants and 9 dioecious plants) in a subtropical forest, China. We constructed three networks by, respectively, combining visitations to dioecious female and male plants at the species level, separating them, and retaining the shared visitations between them. When the shared visitations between male and female plants were considered, the modularity was increased and the nestedness was decreased with a significantly low robustness for the plant community. Only in this network, most dioecious and hermaphroditic plants were associated with different pollinator groups and separated to different modules. The results also showed that dioecious plants were more generalized and more likely to be module hubs in sex-combined network and sex-separated network but not in sex-shared network. Only in the sex-separated network, pollinators in dioecious modules were less selective than in hermaphroditic modules. Our study shows incorporating the different visitations between plant sexes could affect the analysis of key network structure properties and the description of pollination niche. To better understand niche partitioning and stability of plant-pollinator communities, it is necessary to compare pollination networks considering plant sexual diversity.

AB This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the naturalized alien plants of Linosa (Pelagie Archipelago, Sicily), which includes 83 taxa and accounts for 29 % of the total island's flora. Among these plants, 6 are invasive, 49 are naturalized and 28 are casual. With respect to previous available data, our field investigations resulted in the addition of 31 new xenophytes (21 casual and 10 fully naturalized). One of these species is new to the whole European territory (Kleinia anteuphorbia), 6 of them are new to Sicily and 11 are recorded for the first time on circum-Sicilian islets. For each alien plant, we indicate the habitat where the naturalization has been observed by using the codes proposed by Natura 2000 and Corine Biotopes habitat classification. We also provide a list of 159 alien plants that are cultivated in Linosa, but currently not naturalized, in order to underline the key role played by horticulture and gardening in the introduction of exotic species. In order to address this phenomenon and its huge impact on the integrity of both the natural and the traditional rural landscape, several actions are proposed that aim at preventing, controlling and monitoring both the ongoing and the potential invasion processes.

AB Objectives: The expansion of Numic speaking populations into the Great Basin required individuals to adapt to a relatively unproductive landscape. Researchers have proposed numerous social and subsistence strategies to explain how and why these settlers were able to replace any established populations, including private property and intensive plant processing. Here we evaluate these hypotheses and propose a new strategy involving the use of landscape fire to increase resource encounter rates.
   Methods: Implementing a novel, spatially explicit, multi-scalar prey choice model, we examine how individual decisions approximating each alternative strategy (private property, anthropogenic fire, and intensive plant processing) would aggregate at the patch and band level to confer an overall benefit to this colonizing population. Analysis relies on experimental data reporting resource profitability and abundance, ecological data on the historic distribution of vegetation patches, and ethnohistoric data on the distribution of Numic bands.
   Results: Model results show that while resource privatization and landscape fires produce a substantial advantage, intensified plant processing garners the greatest benefit. The relative benefits of alternative strategies vary significantly across ecological patches resulting in variation across ethnographic band ranges. Combined, a Numic strategy including all three alternatives would substantially increase subsistence yields.
   Conclusions: The application of a strategy set that includes landscape fire, privatization and intensified processing of seeds and nuts, explains why the Numa were able to outcompete local populations. This approach provides a framework to help explain how individual decisions can result in such population replacement events throughout human history.

AB The effective use of prescribed fire in biodiversity conservation is currently inhibited by a limited understanding of fire effects on ecosystem processes such as pollination. Orchids inhabiting fire-prone landscapes are likely to be particularly sensitive because they often exhibit highly specialized pollination systems and provide no reward to pollinators, making them dependent on co-flowering heterospecifics to attract and support pollinators. We investigated the hypothesis that fire-driven changes in the local abundance of rewarding heterospecific flowers influence pollination in two rewardless Australian orchid species, Diuris maculata sensu lato and Caladenia tentaculata. Diuris maculata s.l. is thought to achieve pollination by mimicking papilionoid Fabaceae flowers. Caladenia tentaculata attracts male thynnine wasps through sexual deceit, and these wasps forage on the open-access flowers of other taxa. We used a space-for-time substitution design with sites in different stages of post-fire succession where we recorded capsule set in D.maculata s.l., pollinator visitation to C.tentaculata, the floral abundance of rewarding heterospecifics and abiotic conditions. Many rewarding taxa responded to fire age, but there was only weak evidence that capsule set in D.maculata s.l. was positively related to the local floral abundance of rewarding species. There was evidence of an overriding effect of rainfall on capsule set that may have obscured effects of the floral community. Visitation to C.tentaculata was not positively associated with any rewarding heterospecifics, and was negatively associated with rewarding Burchardia umbellata. Our preliminary findings highlight the need to account for multiple factors when trying to detect fire effects on pollination.

AB Understanding methane emissions from natural sources is becoming increasingly important with future climactic uncertainty. Wetlands are the single largest natural source of methane; however, little attention has been given to how biota and interactions between aboveground and belowground communities may affect methane emission rates in these systems. To investigate the effects of vegetative disturbance and belowground biogeochemical alterations induced by biota on methane emissions in situ, we manipulated densities of Littoraria irrorata (marsh periwinkle snails) and Geukensia granosissima (gulf ribbed mussels) inside fenced enclosures within a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh and measured methane emissions and sediment extracellular enzyme activity (phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, peroxidase, and phenol oxidase) over the course of a year. Changes in snail density did not have an effect on methane emission; however, increased densities of ribbed mussels significantly increased the emission of methane. Sediment extracellular enzyme activities for phosphatase, cellobiohydrolase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and phenol oxidase were correlated to methane emission, and none of the enzymes assayed were affected by the snail and mussel density treatments. While methane emissions from salt marsh ecosystems are lower than those from freshwater systems, the high degree of variability in emission rates and the potential for interactions with naturally occurring biota that increase emissions warrant further investigations into salt marsh methane dynamics.

AB African lions (Panthera leo) are threatened across their natural range. However, the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP) is a stronghold for the species. A population assessment in 2010 observed a skew in the sex structure with a greater proportion of males (56%) which raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the greater KTP lion population. A key indicator of how a population responds to changes in population structure is population size. We conducted an intensive lion census between 2013 and 2015 in the southwestern KTP (14 250 km 2) driving 49 784 km over 317 sampling days, which resulted in 1162 lion sightings. Registering the population through individual identification (n = 261) provided a benchmark against which other techniques could be measured and for a non-invasive marking technique. Open-population mark-recapture provided the most precise estimate of population size (n = 246; 95% CI: 237-256). Track indices (n = 242; 95% CI: 176-307) provided a similar best estimate, but were imprecise. Minimum-known-alive calculations (n = 145) provided a gross underestimate. All the methods used in this study indicate a larger lion population size than previous estimates.

AB The freshwater fauna has been judged to be one of the most threatened biotic components in the world. In many tropical-temperate freshwater habitats worldwide the largest invertebrates are crayfish, as is the case with the cambarid crayfish in Mexico. With 98% of endemic species, most of them with reduced distribution ranges, the Mexican crayfish have not been analysed to examine how diversity, endemism and threat are distributed.
   A data set was analysed containing 1419 locality records for the 56 species of crayfish occurring in Mexico arranged in a 251 cell grid. Spatial autocorrelation analyses using Moran's I and G* were conducted; species richness, endemism and threat indices were calculated and mapped. An integrated risk score was derived from the two indices.
   Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed a pattern that significantly departs from a random arrangement. Moran's I showed a positive autocorrelation between cells that are less than 800km apart; while G* analysis identified one hotspot of diversity. Four areas with high endemism and seven areas with intermediate endemism values were recognized. The western portion of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and some areas in the north are of special concern owing to the presence of threatened microendemic species.
   The areas where more threatened species occur differ from those with high endemism values. This distinction makes evident that for species with low dispersal capabilities the areas with high endemism are the product of historical and geological events, while the areas with high numbers of threatened species are those where human activities have had a major impact. The integrated risk score, however, resulting from the combination of endemism and threat, peaks along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and where it joins the Sierra Madre Oriental.
   The integrated risk score proposed in this study, based on well known and frequently used indices in conservation biology, can be used with existing data to determine areas where crayfish species richness, endemism and threat peak to make conservation efforts more cost-effective.

AB Detailed descriptions of individual vegetation types shown on vegetation maps can improve the ways in which the composition and spatial structure within the types are understood. The authors therefore examined dwarf shrub heath, a vegetation type covering large areas and found in many parts of the Norwegian mountains. They used data from point samples obtained in a wall-to-wall area frame survey. The point sampling method provided data that gave a good understanding of the composition and structure of the vegetation type, but also revealed a difference between variation within the vegetation type itself (intra-class variation) and variation resulting from the inclusion of other types of vegetation inside the map polygons (landscape variation). Intra-class variation reflected differences in the botanical composition of the vegetation type itself, whereas landscape variation represented differences in the land-cover composition of the broader landscape in which the vegetation type was found. Both types of variation were related to environmental gradients. The authors conclude that integrated point sampling method is an efficient way to achieve increased understanding of the content of a vegetation map and can be implemented as a supporting activity during a survey.

AB Coastal sand dunes are susceptible to invasive plants that significantly alter these endangered ecosystems. Acacia saligna is a small Australian tree that has become a significant invasive plant in Israel and in many other Mediterranean countries. The aim of this research was to study the impact of A. saligna on the indigenous vegetation of three coastal habitats (sand dunes, inter-dune depressions, and aeolianite [sandstone] ridges) in the Nizzanim Long Term Ecosystem Research Nature Reserve, Israel. Plant observations were conducted in the spring, in the following site types: (1) sites planted with A. saligna and sites invaded by A. saligna; and (2) reference sites not invaded by A. saligna. A simple index, the aggregate ecological value, was developed in order to evaluate the impact and the ecological value of each habitat and site for conservation purposes. The results indicate that planting A. saligna and invasion by A. saligna changed plant community composition, reduced psammophyte species richness, caused the disappearance of most endemic, rare, and protected species, and overall reduced the ecological value of the Nizzanim Nature Reserve.

AB Background: Alien plant invasions are among the major threats to natural and semi-natural ecosystems in South Africa on approximately 18 million hectares of land. Much of the available data are not suitable for planning of local scale management because it is presented at a quarter degree grid square scale, which makes accurate location and estimates of invaded areas difficult.
   Objectives: The aim was to identify the dominant alien plant species and quantify their areal extent along a 479 km railway corridor in the Mpumalanga province. Method: The extent of the invaded area was obtained by manual digitising of alien plant distribution and density from Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 imagery and by further applying an Iterative Self-Organising Data Analysis technique of the unsupervised classification method. Species' occurrences were located and identified in the field using a Global Positioning System.
   Results: The most dominant invaders in terms of the number of individual polygons and the infested area were Eucalyptus spp., Acacia spp., Populus alba L., Pinus patula Schltdl & Cham., Salix babylonica L. and Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston. These species have also been previously classified as major invaders, although the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act regulations permit their planting provided spreading to adjacent areas is avoided except for C. decapetala, which must be cleared under all circumstances.
   Conclusion: Knowledge of the species' occurrence and their extent will assist landowners and relevant authorities to control the spread of alien plants, which impact rail safety, agricultural production, water availability and biodiversity.

AB Understanding the environmental factors governing the spread of alien shrubs is crucial for conserving biodiversity. In the semi-arid savannas of Africa, alien shrub invasion often occurs simultaneously with native shrub encroachment but climate-dependent differences in encroachments of native and alien shrubs have never been properly quantified. A combination of historical aerial photographs and field measurements was used to compare the spread of the invasive shrub Lantana camara L. with that of native encroaching shrubs over a 31-year period in a protected semi-arid savanna in Zimbabwe, southern Africa. We tested whether the response of this invasive alien shrub to rainfall differs from that of native shrub encroachers. Both the invasive shrub L. camara and native encroaching shrubs spread significantly faster during high rainfall years than in dry years. However, the response of L. camara to annual rainfall was stronger than the response of native encroaching shrubs. During years of above-average rainfall, the mean annual rate of spread of L. camara was at least twice that of native shrub encroachers, whereas in other years natives spread at the same rate as the alien shrub. This is a novel finding suggesting that in water-limited savannas, pulses in rainfall may accelerate the spread of some invasive alien species.

AB A new multi-criteria method of evaluation and assessment of the ecological status of lakes is proposed. It is based on macrophytes analysis integrated with geomorphological, landscape and catchment sources of threats. A total of 22 lakes in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve 'West Polesie' (Poland) were investigated along trophic (available nutrients) and human pressure gradients, testing the proposed method with ESMI and TRS indices. Therefore, the present indexation included 22 criteria (i.e., catchment land use, phytolittoral area, number of plant species) concerning three different assessing zones (lakeshore, littoral and surrounding area), and provided a five-class ecological classification. The proposed index, in addition to the general ecological conditions assessment of lakes, allows to point out a zonal evaluation, identifying the most critic zones in terms of ecological status. The proposed method can be universally adapted for any type of lakes, regardless of their geographical characteristics. It can be applied to system monitoring, and to support lakes biodiversity, functionality, conservation, restoration, water protection and uses, as well as water, territory and landscape management actions.

AB Exotic pine invasion affects native wetland communities in the Southern Hemisphere by changing the hydrological regimen and physicochemical characteristics. Studies evaluating the emergence of aquatic invertebrates from dormant stages are vital to identify the resilience of aquatic communities in ponds invaded by exotic pine species. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) pine invasion decreases the richness of drought-resistant aquatic invertebrates in ponds; (2) pine invasion modifies the invertebrate composition in ponds; and (3) these differences in species composition ( diversity) are associated primarily with species turnover. Dry sediment samples were collected from three natural ponds in native grassland and three ponds in a pine invasion matrix in southern Brazil. In all, 7205 invertebrates, primarily represented by cladocerans (18 species), were sampled after rewetting dry sediments. Pine invasion decreased the richness of aquatic invertebrates because the natural ponds had almost 60% more species and a higher number of estimated species than the pine ponds. The composition differed between natural and pine ponds, and this difference in species composition ( diversity) was associated primarily with the replacement of some species by others. The presence of pine appears to alter colonisation and survival rates of aquatic invertebrates that aestivate in dry sediments in southern Brazil wetlands.

AB In conservation studies, solely widespread species are often used as indicators of diversity patterns, but narrow-ranged species can show different patterns. Here, we assess how well subsets of narrow-ranged, widespread or randomly selected plant species represent patterns of species richness and weighted endemism in Gabon, tropical Africa. Specifically, we assess the effect of using different definitions of widespread and narrow-ranged and of the information content of the subsets. Finally, we test if narrow-ranged species are over-represented in species-rich areas. Based on distribution models of Gabonese plant species, we defined sequential subsets from narrow-ranged-to-widespread, widespread-to-narrow-ranged, and 100 randomly arranged species sequences using the range sizes of species in tropical Africa and within Gabon. Along these sequences, correlations between subsets and the total species richness and total weighted endemism patterns were computed. Random species subsets best represent the total species richness pattern, whereas subsets of narrow-ranged species best represent the total weighted endemism pattern. For species ordered according to their range sizes in tropical Africa, subsets of narrow-ranged species represented the total species richness pattern better than widespread species subsets did. However, the opposite was true when range sizes were truncated by the Gabonese national country borders. Correcting for the information content of the subset results in a skew of the sequential correlations, its direction depending on the range-size frequency distribution. Finally, we find a strong, positive, non-linear relation between weighted endemism and total species richness. Observed differences in the contribution of narrow-ranged, widespread and randomly selected species to species richness and weighted endemism patterns can be explained by the range-size frequency distribution and the use of different definitions of widespread or narrow-ranged. We call for a reconsideration of the use of widespread species as an indicator of diversity patterns, and advocate using the full ranges of species when assessing diversity patterns.

AB Bush encroachment can have profound effects on the ability of savanna ecosystems to provide goods and services to society. It is therefore crucial to understand the key drivers of bush encroachment in savannas. In this study, we test whether decadal changes in mean annual rainfall significantly explain changes in the dominant patch size as well as the density of bush patches at six protected savanna sites located along a rainfall gradient in Zimbabwe. We first performed Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet transform within the intensity-dominant scale theoretical framework on multi-temporal aerial photographs and high spatial resolution satellite imagery to objectively detect changes in the dominant patch dimension as well as the intensity of bush cover over a 40-year period at six test sites. We then pooled the data and performed regression analysis relating changes in dominant scale and intensity to decadal changes in mean annual rainfall in order to deduce a possible connection between dynamics of bush encroachment and rainfall variability. Our results indicate a significant nonlinear relationship between changes in the dominant scale and decadal changes in mean annual rainfall (R-2=0.85, F-13=35.96, P<0.01). In contrast, the relationship between decadal changes in mean annual rainfall and changes in intensity was weak and not significant (R-2=0.29, F-13=2.69, P=0.106). These results imply the importance of annual rainfall in explaining long-term changes in the dominant scale of woody patches. However, mechanisms other than rainfall probably explain changes in the intensity of bush cover, and this needs further investigation.

AB The aim of the study was to compare cyanobacterial and algal assemblages occurring in ornithocoprophilous habitats formed under the influence of two seabird colonies (mixed colony of piscivorous Uria lomvia and Rissa tridactyla and planktivorous Alle alle) nesting on the southwest side of Hornsund (Spitsbergen). Various influences of the bird colonies (e.g. surface trophy, treading) lead to the formation of ornithogenic habitats with quantitatively and qualitatively diverse cyanobacterial and algal assemblages. Only 6 species common to both habitats were identified, but due to their different proportions the similarity ended there. Cyanobacterial and algal assemblages of both ornithogenic habitats also react rather differently to the intensity of the bird colonies' influence. The assemblages located directly beneath piscivorous bird nests were characterized by a larger number of species, which decreased the farther from the colony it was. Cyanobacterial and algal assemblages located directly next to planktivorous bird nests were species poor, but species richness increased at locations farther from their direct influence. The obtained results confirmed that bird colonies characterized by different diet and behavior influenced the formation of two separate, quantitatively and qualitatively different cyanobacterial and algal assemblages. Species such as Eucapsis sp., Gleocapsopsis sp., Gloeothece sp., Woronichinia sp., Hematococcus sp. were characteristic for algae and cyanobacteria assemblages in the vicinity of piscivorous bird colonies, whereas Aphanocapsa sp., Gloeothece sp., Komvophoron minutum, Pseudanabaena sp., Gloeocystis sp. 2 occurred in the vicinity of planktivorous bird colonies.

AB Invasion of exotic species is a global challenge and the potential for adverse effects on local biodiversity is particularly high in protected areas. Protected African savanna areas support globally important biodiversity. At the same time, forest plantations are widespread throughout Africa and exotic tree species frequently invade natural areas. To evaluate the potential invasiveness of plant species, it is pertinent to know to what extent, if at all, consumption by native herbivore assemblages differentially affects exotic and indigenous plants. We studied how two globally widespread exotic trees Eucalyptus grandis and Grevillea robusta and two common indigenous trees Milicia excelsa and Maesopsis eminii responded to natural herbivory by large herbivores and termites. We experimentally exposed 720 tree seedlings to: (i) no large herbivores or termites; (ii) termites only; (iii) large herbivores only; and (iv) both large herbivores and termites. When exposed to large herbivores and termites, the total survival was much higher for the exotics with 45% (E.grandis) and 63% (G.robusta) compared to the indigenous species (both 20%). Exposure to large herbivores affected early seedling survival of natives more than the exotics. Apart from the indigenous M.excelsa, survival did not decrease when seedlings were exposed to termites. Large herbivores retarded seedling growth for all species. The exotic E.grandis was the only species capable of growth when exposed to large herbivores. Exposure to termites had only a small, but significant effect resulting in a 7% size difference in all species.Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight how browsing might, for some tree species, adversely affect native seedling survival and growth more than exotic species in protected African savanna. If exotic species are to be used in plantations, managers should consider planting tree species and varieties that are sensitive to ungulate browsing. This will not compromise economic gain because large herbivores are generally less common in plantations. Consequently, local ungulates could function as biological control agents outside plantations and reduce the potential risk of exotic plants proliferating in protected areas.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID SPECIALIZATION; CONSERVATION; EVOLUTION; POLLEN; FRUIT
AB Orchids are generally recognized to have specialist pollination systems and low fruit set is often thought to be characteristic of the family. In this study, we investigated the reproductive ecology of Cleisostoma linearilobatum, an epiphytic tropical orchid, in a holy hill forest fragment and a traditional tea garden in SW China using comparable methods. C. linearilobatum is self-compatible and dependent on insects for pollination. Fruit production in natural conditions was both pollinator- and resource-limited. However, the natural fruit set remained stable over multiple years at both sites. Pollination observations showed that C. linearilobatum has a generalized pollination system and seven insect species were observed as legitimate pollinators. Although the visit frequencies of different pollinators were different in the two sites, the pollinator assemblages ensured reproductive success of C. linearilobatum in both study sites over multiple years. The results partly explain why C. linearilobatum is so successful in the area, and also suggest that holy hill forest fragments and traditional tea gardens in Xishuangbanna are important in preserving orchids, especially those with generalist pollination.

AB Photoresponse in nauplii, juveniles, and adult hermaphrodites of the clam shrimp Eulimnadia braueriana Ishikawa, 1895 was measured under four different artificial illuminances ranging from 19,688 to 48,286 lux. The nauplii displayed consistent positive phototaxis through all illuminances. The juveniles and adults, however, showed no response to the dimmest light and reacted negatively at all the other treatments. The change in phototaxis occurs when nauplii develop into juveniles and may lead to a different vertical distribution. It signifies an adaptive strategy in dispersion, foraging, predator avoidance, and in minimizing intraspecific competition.

AB The Succulent Karoo, one of two arid biodiversity hotspots in the world, is known for its high plant species richness, but little is known about the influence of topography and how it mediates the potentially deleterious effects of grazing. Changes in vegetation species composition, cover and species diversity were examined along piosphere gradients on northerly slopes, bottomlands and low-lying plains on 45 farms. Landscapes differed in the plant species-and life-form composition, species richness and cover, with the more species-rich, heterogeneous grassy northerly slopes distinct from the plains and bottomlands, which were dominated by Pteronia pallens, Psilocaulon junceum and Drosanthenum spp. with more annual and ephemeral species. Overall, species richness declined linearly with decreasing rangeland condition. A weak grazing effect was detected only on the north-facing slopes, where shrubs and grass decreased with intense grazing. Years of overgrazing have resulted in the widespread dominance of P. pallens, especially on the plains and bottomlands, rendering them insensitive to grazing. The current condition of the northern slopes should be maintained and managed such that palatable species can spread to more degraded areas of the landscape.

AB The relationship between ammonia (NH3) concentrations downwind from a penguin colony and local surface greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was investigated on the remote sub-Antarctic Bird Island (54 degrees 00'S, 38 degrees 03'W) during summer 2010 (November and December). A Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) colony (40,000 pairs) at Goldcrest Point is a large point source of NH3 on the island and a measurement transect of 23 m, 36 m, 70 m, 143 m and 338 m was set up downwind from the colony. Atmospheric NH3 concentrations measured by passive diffusion samplers declined from 23 mu g m(-3) close to the colony to less than 1 mu g m(-3) 338 m downwind. As increased nitrogen (N) deposition can affect soil carbon (C) and N cycling, it can therefore potentially influence GHG and nitric oxide (NO) emission rates. However, in this study, a clear correlation between surface GHG fluxes and atmospheric NH3 concentrations could not be established. Average fluxes for nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the entire transect and the eight week study period ranged from 7 to 23 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), -5.5 -245 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and CO2 respiration rates averaged 2.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Laboratory studies using intact soil cores from the transect also did not show any significant correlation between atmospheric NH3 concentrations and N2O, NO, CH4 emissions or CO2 respiration rates. Overall, fluxes measured in the laboratory study reflected the high variability measured in the field. Large changes in soil depth along the transect, due to the topography of the island, possibly influenced fluxes more than NH3 concentration and seabirds appeared to have a more localised input (e.g. ground nesting birds). However, warmer temperatures might have a large potential to increase GHG fluxes in this ecosystem. This study confirms that GHG fluxes do occur in these ornithogenic ecosystems, however, the scale of the impact remains largely unquantified due to high uncertainties and high spatial variability.

AB Many species have multi-stage life cycles in which the youngest stages (e.g., larvae) are small, dispersive, and abundant, whereas later stages are sessile or sedentary. Quantifying survival throughout such early stages is critical for understanding dispersal, population dynamics, and life history evolution. However, dispersive stages can be very difficult to sample in situ, and estimates of survival through the entire duration of these stages are typically poor. Here we describe how demographic information from juveniles and adults can be used to estimate survival throughout a dispersive larval stage that was not sampled directly. Using field measurements of demography, we show that detailed information on post-settlement growth, survival, and reproduction can be used to estimate average larval survivorship under the assumption that a typical individual replaces itself over its lifetime. Applying this approach to a common coral reef fish (bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus), we estimated average larval survivorship to be 0.108 % (95 % CI 0.025-0.484). We next compared this demography-based estimate to an expected value derived from published estimates of larval mortality rates. Our estimate of larval survivorship for bicolor damselfish was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than what would be expected if larval mortality of this species followed the average, size-dependent pattern of mortality inferred from a published sample of marine fishes. Our results highlight the importance of understanding mortality during the earliest phases of larval life, which are typically not sampled, as well as the need to understand the details of how larval mortality scales with body size.

AB South African savanna grasslands are often characterised by indigestible tufted grass species whereas lawn grasses are far more desirable in terms of herbivore sustenance. We aimed to investigate the role of nutrients and/or the disturbance (grazing, trampling) by herbivores on the formation of grazing lawns. We conducted a series of common garden experiments to test the effect of nutrients on interspecific competition between a typical lawn-forming grass species (Cynodon dactylon) and a species that is frequently found outside grazing lawns (Hyparrhenia hirta), and tested for the effect of herbivore disturbance in the form of trampling and clipping. We also performed a vegetation and herbivore survey to apply experimentally derived insights to field observations. Our results showed that interspecific competition was not affected by soil nutrient concentrations. C. dactylon did show much more resilience to disturbance than H. hirta, presumably due to the regenerative capacity of its rhizomes. Results from the field survey were in line with these findings, describing a correlation between herbivore pressure and C. dactylon abundance. We conclude that herbivore disturbance, and not soil nutrients, provide C. dactylon with a competitive advantage over H. hirta, due to vegetative regeneration from its rhizomes. This provides evidence for the importance of concentrated, high herbivore densities for the creation and maintenance of grazing lawns.

AB Minimising the spread and impact of alien plants is a crucial component of land management for biodiversity conservation. Alien plant management typically focuses on either controlling selected alien species ('species-led'), or on minimizing invasions within selected biodiversity or cultural assets ('asset-led'). Here, we compare and combine species- and asset-led approaches to prioritise alien plant management activities in the world's largest Mediterranean-climate woodland, located in south-western Australia. Our species-led approach focused on identifying aliens likely to be increasingly problematic in future with a changing climate. Our asset-led approach used comprehensive flora survey data to identify key predictors of contemporary alien presence, with the purpose of minimising alien occurrence across the asset of a relatively little-disturbed landscape. Most aliens were associated with climates more mesic than are predicted to occur in the region in future. A limited range of alien taxa (12 %) are predicted to be both highly invasive in the future and feasibly eradicated or contained, and it is these that should be subject to species-led management. A consistent set of management-related predictors of contemporary alien presence were identified, including closer proximity to towns, buildings and water points, and occurrence on a geology and soil type associated with prospective mineral deposits. Addressing the highest management priorities of each approach would appear to be a complementary and parsimonious way forward for regional-scale alien management for biodiversity conservation, as this tackles the processes associated with contemporary alien spread (asset-led approach) while taking a precautionary approach to pre-empt future problematic invasions (species-led approach).

AB The eradication of dominant, nonnative trees can alter soil conditions in forest ecosystems by changing the forest's water balance. To test this idea, we measured water in surface soil in forests dominated by an invasive nonnative tree (Casuarina equisetifolia Forst.) on Nishijima Island, a subtropical island in the Ogasawara Islands group, northwestern Pacific Ocean. The volumetric water content of surface soils at sites where all trees of C. cquisctiftli a were killed by herbicide was compared with adjacent invaded control sites, and effects of time since tree removal (up to 3 yr) were assessed. Dry weights of accumulated litter, total canopy openness of the forest canopy, maximum heights, and total plant cover of herbaceous vegetation were also compared between treatment and control plots. Volumetric soil water content in quadrats where C. equisetifolia trees were removed (removal area) was significantly higher than at control quadrats. We found that the effect of C. equisetifolia removal on soil water content slightly decreased 3 yr after removal. In addition, the dry weights of accumulated litter in removal quadrats decreased with time after removal, and maximum heights and total plant cover increased. We observed higher values of total canopy openness at removal sites regardless of time after removal. These results suggested that the death of these dominant, nonnative trees could increase the available water in soils of invaded forests, and that increases may be related to changes in the water balance of the ecosystem, which can in turn affect restoration of forest ecosystems.

AB We tested the role of interspecific competition in driving species distribution at multiple spatial scales using two sibling species of Galerida larks (G. cristata and G. theklae) in Morocco (sympatry), Balearic islands (G. theklae only) and Israel (G. cristata only). We first investigated regional-scale determinants by contrasting allopatric versus sympatric patterns in five distinct habitat types. We next focused on a single habitat used by both species, the coastal sand dunes. Dune quadrats were established along the Moroccan coast and completed by a quadrat in the nearest distinct landscape habitat. Poisson regressions were used to model Galerida counts together with ecological predictors as concerns the climate, topography, vegetation structure and soil granulometry. At the local scale, both species preferred grey dunes over white sand dunes, and both were negatively affected by the abundance of the congeneric species in the dune. However, we found that G. theklae tended to replace G. cristata in more arid sand dunes, even if the transition was not strictly clinal. Instead, the transition occurred when the surrounding landscape changed from coastal wetlands to bathas (grasslands with shrubs), highlighting the importance of habitat composition at the landscape scale. The fact that G. cristata used bathas in allopatry, but not in sympatry, suggested that the competitive environment contributed to determine sand dune occupancy. We suggest that landscape-level effects may be pivotal in explaining species distribution not only at the local scale, by affecting the pool of potential immigrants, but also at the regional scale, by contributing to species' range limit

AB African Olive (Olea europaea ssp. cuspidata) is a densely crowned evergreen small tree, native to eastern Africa that is highly invasive in areas where it has been introduced, including Hawaii and Australia. Invasion by African Olive threatens Cumberland Plain Woodland, a critically endangered grassy eucalypt woodland from western Sydney, Australia, through the formation of a dense mid-canopy excluding the regeneration of native species. We established a 3-year field experiment to determine the effectiveness of direct seeding and fire, as techniques for early stage restoration of a 2ha historically cleared and degraded Cumberland Plain Woodland site after the removal of African Olive. Direct seeding was able to re-establish a native perennial grass cover which was resistant to subsequent weed invasion and could be managed as an important first stage in woodland restoration with fire and selective herbicide. Fire was able to stimulate some germination of colonising native species from the soil seed bank after 15years of African Olive invasion; however, germination and establishment of native shrubs from the applied seed mix was poor. We propose a bottom-up' model of ecological restoration in such highly degraded sites that uses a combination of direct seeding and stimulation of the soil seed bank by fire, which could be applicable to other degraded grassy woodland sites and plant communities.

TI Drought resistance of native pioneer species indicates potential
   suitability for restoration of post-mining areas
SO WEB ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to test whether invasive exotic species, predominantly used for restoring post-mining areas in north-eastern Vietnam, may be replaced by ecologically superior native pioneer species, we conducted a drought stress experiment in a greenhouse. We hypothesized that juvenile individuals of four native pioneer tree and two native pioneer grass species have a drought resistance comparable to two exotic reference species. Our results confirm this hypothesis: even under drought, native trees had a higher biomass and root : shoot ratio than exotic trees, although their maximum relative elongation rate and biomass were reduced more strongly than for exotic trees with respect to well-watered conditions. Native grasses had a higher root length density and a similar drought-induced reduction of stomatal conductance compared to exotic trees. In spite of a higher biomass reduction, native grasses produced more biomass under drought in absolute terms. Notwithstanding that further investigations of other adverse environmental factors need to be performed, our results indicate with respect to drought resistance that native pioneer species are a potential alternative to exotic species for the ecological restoration of subtropical post-mining areas, which may accelerate secondary succession.

AB The purple clam Amiantis purpurata (Lamarck) is a warm-temperate species inhabiting shallow water along the coast from Espiritu Santo (Brazil) to northern Patagonia. It is one of the few survivors of the middle-late Miocene faunal turnover which was characterized by the appearance of new taxa, most of them living now along the Argentinean coast. In order to study the biogeographic history of A. purpurata, a detailed review of its records was carried out. The oldest record of this species is from late Miocene rocks in Uruguay, and it appears that A. purpurata survived because its wide thermal tolerance range allowed larvae to migrate southwards from Uruguay, settling on the southern coast of Buenos Aires Province and San Maths Gulf. The characteristics of this gulf would have favored the development and settlement of the larvae, thus giving rise to the most abundant southern population during the Pleistocene. At the end of the Pleistocene, A. purpurata also survived the Last Glacial Maximum. During the Holocene, the population of A. purpurata in San Matias Gulf became isolated, but also represented the most abundant southern population of this species. During its brief Neogene history, Amiantis purpurata followed main global, regional and local events; thus it can be considered as an environmental indicator for this period.

AB Currently the introduction and spread of invasive species is an issue of great concern. To effectively manage this problem it is essential to know what constitute invasion hotspots. In this respect, the role of urban green areas in the conservation of biodiversity is a controversial matter. These areas may either favour colonization by alien species or shelter species of high conservation value. We evaluated the influence of location (island, coastal or inland) on the exotic and native ant fauna recorded in 27 urban green areas in Spain. A forward-stepwise discriminant analysis revealed differences between these locations in terms of the composition of the fauna, with exotic species identified as being the most important discriminating variable. There is a gradient: inland-coastal-island, along which there is significant increase in importance in terms of species richness and abundance of particular exotic species and decrease in the dominance of both common and rare native species. Areas located on the Island were more susceptible to invasion by alien ants. Coastal areas were also more susceptible to invasion than inland areas. These results possibly reflect the greater probability of an invasive species reaching these locations and the milder weather conditions at these sites, which would favour their establishment.

AB Renosterveld is a Mediterranean-type shrubland in the south-western Cape of South Africa. It is an exceptionally species-rich habitat and a local biodiversity hotspot. However, it has been strongly fragmented due to land use intensification during the last centuries. We analysed the impact of fragmentation on the genetic variation of a typical renosterveld species, the annual herb Nemesia barbata. For our investigation we selected populations of the species in 20 renosterveld fragments of different sizes in the Cape lowlands and determined genetic variation within and between populations using amplified fragment polymorphsims (AFLPs). We expected genetic pauperisation within small and isolated fragments and a lack of gene flow between these fragments.
   We observed considerable genetic variation within but only a low level of variation between populations. Genetic variation within populations was not correlated with the size of the fragment or the distance to the nearest adjacent fragment. However, genetic variation between populations was positively correlated with geographic distance between fragments, indicating historical and/or actual gene flow.
   Based upon our results, we conclude that habitat fragmentation does not yet influence the genetic variation of N. barbata. Historical and possibly actual gene flow, combined with buffering effects of the soil seed bank, appear to have minimized the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation on genetic variation of this renosterveld species.

TI ENDEMIC LAND MOLLUSCS IN GEORGIA (CAUCASUS): HOW WELL ARE THEY PROTECTED

AB The globally significant Caucasus hotspot of biological diversity holds a rich and largely endemic fauna of land molluscs. Georgia holds the majority of these regional endemics. Land molluscs are particularly sensitive indicators of habitat quality and faunal diversity. In this study, we examine the extent to which the existing network of protected areas (PAs) within Georgia captures the hotspots of endemic molluscan diversity. We collected and mapped the records of Georgian and Caucasian endemic species onto a 20 x 20 km(2) UTM grid to identify the most important endemic areas in Georgia. We related these to the existing network of PAs. Less than half of the richest grid cells included significant PAs. Although those endemics with the smallest known ranges were better protected than the remainder, the incomplete state of knowledge means that our estimates of existing protection are surely optimistic. To date, the designation of PAs in Georgia has not used distributional data for invertebrates, although elsewhere they have been shown to be an effective aid to planning and management for conservation. Further surveys of molluscs and their monitoring in existing PAs can and should inform a systematic conservation strategy in Georgia.

AB Culture-dependent evaluation of the bacteria was carried out on gastropods, such as Monodonta lineata, Gibbula umbilicalis, Nucella lapillus and Patella intermedia, and the environmental samples (biofilm and surrounding sea water) collected from six different locations of Northern Portugal coastal area to investigate the interactions between the microbes in the viscera of gastropods and in the environment. A total of 141 isolates and 39 operational taxonomic units were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene showed that bacterial isolates are highly diverse and most of them were found in other marine environment. The observed bacterial diversity was distributed over five different classes (Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria) with the greatest number of 16S rRNA gene sequence derived from the Gammaproteobacteria (77 %). Vibrio is found to be the dominant one among the different bacterial species isolated. The results suggest that the microorganisms in the environment are maintained in the viscera of the gastropods which may have a key role in the metabolic functions.

AB Reliably translating real-world spatial patterns of ecosystems is critical for understanding processes susceptible to reinforce resilience. However, the great majority of studies in spatial ecology use thematic maps to describe habitats and species in a binary scheme. By discretizing the transitional areas and neglecting the gradual replacement across a given space, the thematic approach may suffer from substantial limitations when interpreting patterns created by many continuous variables. Here, local and regional spectral proxies were used to design and spatially map at very fine scale a continuous index dedicated to one of the most complex seascapes, the coral reefscape. Through a groundbreaking merge of bottom-up and top-down approach, we demonstrate that three to seven-habitat continuous indices can be modeled by nine, six, four, and three spectral proxies, respectively, at 0.5 m spatial resolution using hand- and spaceborne measurements. We map the seven-habitat continuous index, spanning major Indo-Pacific coral reef habitats through the far red-green normalized difference ratio over the entire lagoon of a low (Tetiaroa atoll) and a high volcanic (Moorea) island in French Polynesia with 84 and 82% accuracy, respectively. Further examinations of the two resulting spatial models using a customized histoscape (density function of model values distributed on a concentric strip across the reef crest-coastline distance) show that Tetiaroa exhibits a greater variety of coral reef habitats than Moorea. By designing such easy-to-implement, transferrable spectral proxies of coral reef regime, this study initiates a framework for spatial ecologists tackling coral reef biodiversity, responses to stresses, perturbations and shifts. We discuss the limitations and contributions of our findings toward the study of worldwide coral reef resilience following stochastic environmental change.

AB Successful agroforestry management depends on the interactions between the mixed species. Belowground interactions between shrubs and native grasses are complicated and poorly understood in China's agroforestry practice, especially in the silvopasture systems of droughty northern China. The distribution of fine roots (<2 mm) in an alley sllvopasture system consisting of Caragana microphylla Lam. and local grasses was compared to those in a degraded pasture plot using soil cores. Fine root production was examined in these plots using ingrowth cores. We found that the introduction of C. microphylla did not change the vertical distribution pattern of fine roots of grassy plants but had a great impact on belowground production in the ecosystem. Grass fine roots decreased with depth in both the silvopasture system and the degraded pasture. Grass fine roots were mostly distributed in the top 40 cm of the soil, but they extended to deeper soil layers through root elongation. C. microphylla, in contrast, occupied the deeper soil layer, in which water was continuously available. We conclude that the belowground interactions between native grasses and C. microphylla in sandy soil can be explained by Walter's 2-layer hypothesis, which is used to explain the coexistence of trees and grasses. Our results draw attention to the interspecific configuration of the silvopasture system and belowground interactions of plants in semiarid and arid regions.

AB Advection-diffusion models were constructed to simulate migration patterns of juvenile and adult spiny lobsters off southern South Africa. Models based on tag-recapture information collected between 1978 and 2005 (2665 tag recaptures) were used to quantify directional movements and to estimate distances moved along a bathymetric gradient. Sex, length at tagging, tagging area and time at large were the main explanatory variables considered. Empirical tests showed that tagging did not delay the onset of advective movements. Lobsters were advected from west to east, and no return migrations were observed. Advection was strongly size dependent, with juvenile and small mature individuals moving further than larger adults. Advection was also area dependent, decreasing from west to east, and lobsters at the easternmost site were not advected and did not receive immigrants from elsewhere. Juvenile lobsters tagged at a recruitment hotspot at the westernmost site migrated 100 to 250 km onto the Agulhas Bank (90% probability after 5 yr at large), or continued along the coast to more distant sites (400 to 900 km; 10% after 5 yr). This effect was stronger in males, but we could not detect a trade-off in growth rate. Two theories are advanced to explain these migration strategies: evolutionary effects of past range expansions and density dependence. A novel approach for quantifying migrations in spiny lobsters is demonstrated, for potential use in spatial fisheries management.

AB Nutrient rich conditions often promote plant invasions, yet additions of non-nitrogen (N) nutrients may provide a novel approach for conserving native symbiotic N-fixing plants in otherwise N-limited ecosystems. Lupinus oreganus is a threatened N-fixing plant endemic to prairies in western Oregon and southwest Washington (USA). We tested the effect of non-N fertilizers on the growth, reproduction, tissue N content, and stable isotope delta(15) N composition of Lupinus at three sites that differed in soil phosphorus (P) and N availability. We also examined changes in other Fabaceae (primarily Vicia sativa and V. hirsuta) and cover of all plant species. Variation in background soil P and N availability shaped patterns of nutrient limitation across sites. Where soil P and N were low, P additions increased Lupinus tissue N and altered foliar d delta N-15, suggesting P limitation of N fixation. Where soil P was low but N was high, P addition stimulated growth and reproduction in Lupinus. At a third site, with higher soil P, only micro-and macronutrient fertilization without N and P increased Lupinus growth and tissue N. Lupinus foliar delta(15) N averaged 20.010% across all treatments and varied little with tissue N, suggesting consistent use of fixed N. In contrast, foliar delta(15) N of Vicia spp. shifted towards 0% as tissue N increased, suggesting that conditions fostering N fixation may benefit these exotic species. Fertilization increased cover, N fixation, and tissue N of nontarget, exotic Fabaceae, but overall plant community structure shifted at only one site, and only after the dominant Lupinus was excluded from analyses. Our finding that non-N fertilization increased the performance of Lupinus with few community effects suggests a potential strategy to aid populations of threatened legume species. The increase in exotic Fabaceae species that occurred with fertilization further suggests that monitoring and adaptive management should accompany any large scale applications.

AB Predation ecology of large sympatric carnivores, tiger, leopard and dhole, as influenced by available wild ungulates, chital, sambar, nilgai, gaur and wild pig, were studied between January 2007 and June 2010 in a tropical deciduous forest of Central India. Both line transect and vehicle transect methods were used to estimate population structure and sex ratios of wild ungulates. The observed adult sex ratio (female : male) was found to be skewed towards females for all ungulates. A total of 123 tiger kills were recorded in the cold season and 162 in the hot season, 32 leopard kills were recorded during the cold season and 48 during the hot season and 32 dhole kills were recorded in the cold season and 55 in the hot season. The age-sex class distribution of each ungulate species in the kill data was compared with the corresponding population age-sex distribution recorded from line transects and vehicle transects. All three large carnivores preferred medium-sized prey species, e.g. chital. A significant difference was observed when comparing different health conditions of prey species predated by the three large carnivores. The observed difference in prey choice as per their body size is a strategy adopted by large carnivores to partition prey resources, thus increasing the potential to avoid intra-guild competition.

AB Temporary depression wetlands form a characteristic feature of the wet-season landscape in the south-western Cape region of South Africa, yet they remain largely unstudied. We hypothesized that the loss of sclerophyllous Sand fynbos habitat around these temporary wetlands causes in-wetland physico-chemical changes. We expected to observe a decrease in the concentration of humic substances in wetlands and a corresponding rise in surface water pH as fynbos cover decreases around wetlands, in this case owing to alien vegetation invasion. A set of 12 differentially invaded temporary depression wetlands within a Sand fynbos ecosystem in Cape Town were repeatedly sampled during the 2009 wet season. Multivariate gradient analysis techniques revealed associations between fynbos cover bordering wetlands and various physico-chemical and biotope constituents within wetlands. Univariate linear regression models reported strong and temporally consistent negative relationships between terrestrial fynbos vegetation cover and wetland pH and positive relationships with humic content. Results indicate that replacement of Sand fynbos with alien vegetation causes a reduction of humic input to wetlands, which in turn has knock-on effects on other wetland environmental constituents such as pH. These findings are expected to be applicable to any wetland where surrounding humic-rich sclerophyllous vegetation is replaced by a non-sclerophyllous agent.

AB Understanding how the management practices of silvopastoral systems affect the long-term sustainability of oak ecosystems and what their influence is on nutrient cycling and plant community, is of great interest. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of relative grazing intensity on soil properties and on vegetation characteristics in an open canopy oak forest dominated by Quercus frainetto. The research was conducted in the area of Pentalofos, which is located in Evros region, north-eastern Greece and is grazed by goats. The distance from a goat corral was used to represent relative grazing intensity. In June 2011, soil and vegetation samples were collected along transects placed at 50, 150, 300, 600 and 1200 m from the goat corral, running perpendicular to three replicates. Soil measurements included pH, phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations while vegetation measurements included plant cover, species composition and diversity. Plant cover was not significantly different among grazing intensities. Species diversity, especially of the woody vegetation layer, was significantly higher in the light grazing intensity in comparison to both the heavy and the very light grazing. Heavy grazing reduced soil organic matter while it increased total nitrogen. Grazing intensity did not affect available P and soil pH. Light to moderate goat grazing could ameliorate floristic diversity and increase sustainability of oak forests in the Mediterranean region.

AB Self-thinning-related mortality has been encountered in extensively cultured scallop populations. Here we report an experiment aimed at studying actual population dynamics of scallops undergoing self-thinning and develop a model of the process. Scallops were kept in small tanks at various initial population densities. Growth and survival were monitored for 39 months. Two cohorts were monitored (cohorts 1 and 2 were 1 and 2 years old, respectively). Growth was density-dependent in cohort 2. Survivorship was high in cohort 1 during the first summer but mass mortality occurred during the second summer. Mortality in cohort 2 peaked during the first summer. In both cohorts, peak mortality occurred at age 2+ years and thus was uncoupled among cohorts. Therefore, negative environmental factors are ruled out as explanations of mortality. Instead, it appears as if self-thinning interacted with some ontogenetic factor. Although cohort 1 was undergoing self-thinning, trends in biomass-density curves were non-monotonous because of mass mortality. In contrast, self-thinning in cohort 2 followed a classical pattern. One possible mechanism for such contrasting differences was that 1+-year-old scallops produced byssal threads and attached to one another during the first year, forming multilayered clumps. This behaviour disappeared during the second year and mass mortality was experienced as scallops adopted a single-layered arrangement. Although details may differ among species, the process depicted above provides a potential trigger to the sequence of events leading to mass mortality in scallop culture. Our model suggests that self-thinning occurred in all density groups, with a common slope but with different elevations in the biomass-density space.

AB Environmental sustainability of post mined limestone quarries often requires reclamation to a diverse woody plant community. Woody species diversity may be severely limited if only nursery stock is relied on for propagation material; thus other sources must be evaluated. To address woody species establishment and survival from different propagule sources at a limestone quarry in western Canada, native trees (4) and shrubs (3) were seeded and transplanted into amended substrates (wood shavings, clean fill, unamended control) in two seasons (spring, fall). Plant sources were nursery stock, local forest wildlings, seeds and forest soil (LFH mineral soil mix). Plant emergence, survival, height, health and browsing were evaluated over four years. Survival was greater with fall transplanted seedlings than with spring transplanted. Survival was greater for Picea glauca, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Populus tremuloides from nursery than local source stock. Seedlings from seeds and LFH did not survive for any of the species. Growth and survival were affected by bighorn sheep. Amendments did not improve plant establishment. Diversity of the woody plant community was increased at the quarry in spite of the severe conditions.

AB Phytosociological databases are important data sources for a broad scale of ecological investigations. Vegetation samples are traditionally managed and published in tabular format, allowing for handling of the vegetation data in various combinations. Such tables usually comprise releves originated from the same locality, vegetation type and collected by the same investigator. Nevertheless, these releves are usually affected by the same bias. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of the effects acting at the level of the table (i.e., 'locally'), using the example of species removals from groups of releves. We examine the effect of the removal of infrequent species on community classification in relation with several data set properties using simulated plot data sampled from simulated coenoclines. A data set comprised groups of releves ('tables'), within which releves are sampled from the same point of the coenocline. Classifications obtained after the removal or permutation of infrequent species occurrences from these tables, after the removal of rare species from randomised tables and without any treatment were compared to a reference classification based on gradient positions of the releves. The results show that the removal of locally infrequent species helps to recognise the gradient pattern incorporated in the tabular arrangement of releves if the arrangement of releves among tables is in accordance with their gradient position. In cases when the grouping of releves is irrelevant regarding the real underlying pattern, the species removal is disadvantageous. Testing between-table heterogeneity within a data set is an especially successful way of examination of biological relevance of the arrangement of releves. We conclude that influence of table-level effects is mainly dependent on the pattern which is in accordance with the grouping of plots.

AB There has been considerable recent progress in integrating equilibrium and nonequilibrium rangeland ecologies on the basis of landscape heterogeneity. This follows from the argument that small key resource areas provide spatial buffer effects that sustain animal populations and are prone to animal-vegetation density-dependency, whereas wet-season ranges are density-independent. Although dryland spatial heterogeneity generally occurs through a combination of heterogeneous precipitation and landscape heterogeneity, the former is rarely considered in the development of such theories. Here, we used a published multi-agent model to examine how both types of heterogeneity interact. We found that a certain level of density-dependency occurred in wet-season range, even under extreme nonequilibrium conditions. During a drought, most of the key resources and part of the wet-season range that was not subject to drought simultaneously exhibited density-dependency, reflecting the impact of rainfall heterogeneity. With decreased key resource area, the density-dependency of the wet-season range after livestock population recovery-a factor included in current theory-decreased dramatically, whereas that during drought-a factor neglected in current theory-did not decrease markedly. Therefore, our results extend current theory by suggesting that the contradiction stemmed from neglecting the spatial buffer effect of heterogeneous precipitation, which is responsible for density-dependency of wet-season ranges during drought.

AB The fruiting seasonality of fig and non-fig species was studied for two years in a tropical. dry evergreen forest (TDEF) in Sriharikota, southern India, to assess the influence of rainfall on fleshy-fruit production and to compare the fruiting seasonality of fig with non-fig species. Fifty non-fig species and four fig species were monitored to record fruiting seasonality. A majority (37) of the 50 non-fig fleshy-fruit species produced ripe fruits during the rainy season. There was a positive correlation between rainfall and number of species with ripe fruits. In contrast, figs did not show any seasonality, conforming to the universal pattern of asynchrony. Fruiting peak in figs coincided with some lean fruiting periods of non-fig species, but not with all lean periods of non-fig fruiting. This study confirms the strong influence of rainfall on fleshy-fruit production in non-fig species. It also reveals that figs are an important fruit resource for frugivores during periods of fruit scarcity, but not during all periods of fruit scarcity.

AB Laboratory experiments with natural zooplankton communities were carried out to study the effects of two contrasting temperature regimes: constant temperature (15, 20, and 25 degrees C) and graded changes in temperature. The graded regime consisted of repeated sustained (three weeks) controlled stepwise temperature changes of 5 or 10 degrees C within 15-25 degrees C on the population dynamics of four dominant species of lake littoral zooplankton, Daphnia longispina (Muller, 1785), Diaphanosoma brachyurum (Lievin, 1848), Simocephalus vetulus (Muller, 1776) and Chydorus sphaericus (Muller, 1785). The results show that controlled stepwise changes (positive or negative) in temperature within the ranges of 15-20, 20-25, and 15-25 degrees C can exert either stimulating or inhibitory effect (direct or delayed) on the development of D. longispina and S. vetulus populations. The development of D. brachyurum and Ch. sphaericus, both more steno-thermophile, was only stimulated by a stable elevated temperature (25 degrees C). These results support the previously formulated hypothesis that, in determining the ecological temperature optimum of a species within a natural community, it is not enough to define its optimum from constant, cyclic or random temperature fluctuations, but also from unidirectional stepwise changes in temperature. These stepwise changes may also induce prolonged or delayed effects.

AB We present a mechanistic formulation of the intake response of ruminants to vegetation biomass based solely on physiological and morphological parameters that scale allometrically with the animal's body mass. The model is applied to describe herbivore-vegetation interactions in dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes with low quality but abundant "tall grass" and high quality but sparsely available "short grass", under two conditions: "uncoupled" (such that the effect of food intake on vegetation biomass can be neglected), or "coupled" (such that the vegetation biomass is determined by herbivore feeding). The results show that under uncoupled conditions, the minimum acceptance (proportion of vegetation consumed by the herbivore) at which the herbivore can leave its current patch without reducing its intake rate is when it has depleted the current patch by the energetic cost required to travel to another patch. The maximum acceptance at which the herbivore should leave its patch is when it has depleted the current patch by the cumulative energetic cost of traveling, handling, cropping, and digesting. Under coupled conditions, the optimal acceptance equals half the relative growth rate of the vegetation. Analytical solutions are obtained for equilibrium values for utilization of the vegetation, and for the densities of vegetation and ruminants, expressed in physiological and morphological herbivore parameters.

AB Grazing is one of the key processes in terrestrial ecosystems and this can be provided by both indigenous and domestic ungulates. However, a question remains whether or not traditional forms of land use such as the grazing of domestic animals support the maintenance of biodiversity. If it does not, then the second question becomes to what extent does grazing of domestic animals alter the systems and processes that support biodiversity? This study demonstrates that in attempting to answer this question, small organisms like dung beetles are ideal indicators that can be used to express significant differences between conserved (indigenous) and non-conserved (domestic) land. As a general trend, studies that investigated these differences displayed differences through analysis of the diversity indices. This method has in most cases demonstrated a lack of contrast between conserved and non-conserved land. In the existence of such uncertainty this study has demonstrated that in such cases, where the analysis of biodiversity indices fail to demonstrate significant differences a closer examination of actual species such as guilds and functional groups could confirm significant differences between conserved and non-conserved land. These apparently conflicting findings reflect the need to consider the actual elements of biodiversity (e.g. species) when assessing conservation issues rather than just the statistical measures of biodiversity.

AB Imitation is one of the central processes underlying learning. Although the mechanisms of imitation at the individual level have received considerable attention, the population effects of imitative behavior have scarcely been investigated. In this paper I address the problem of self-organization at the population level emerging from imitative behavior between individuals. The model considered is a modification of that developed by Durrett and Levin [Durrett, R., Levin, S.A., 2005. Can stable social groups be maintained by homophilous imitation alone? J. Econ. Behav. Organ. 57, 267-286] in investigation of the coexistence of social groups. I modified the previous model in order to approach it in describing not only human societies but also animal populations with simpler cultures. In contrast with the other studies, I do not assume any payoffs related to imitation behavior and the existence of social rank. Individuals are assumed to be of equal rank and to accept opinions of others in proportion to their similarity (homophilous imitation). The symmetrical structure of interactions induces random drift and development of stable self-organized social groups in both homogeneous and spatially distributed societies. This type of self-organization may be widely distributed in natural systems, where imitative behavior takes place. In particular, it can be involved in origins of dialects and ring species.

AB The legume trees Dichrostachys cinerea, Acacia karroo and Acacia nilotica are encroaching a number of African savannas. I quantified the extent to which these species regenerated by seeds and root suckers respectively, and how land management affects the mode of regeneration. I used transects at three sites inside the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and at three sites in adjacent villages outside the park to score all individuals shorter than 20 cm. I also excavated the roots to determine whether the plant was a gamete or a ramet connected to an established mother tree. I found D. cinerea regenerated to equal extent vegetatively and sexually, while A. karroo and A. nilotica mainly regenerated sexually. The present results suggest that the capacity of sexual regeneration of trees is important to consider in future management of bush encroachment in southern African savannas. (C) 2009 SAAB.

AB The present study evaluated the usefulness of collection of location specific data for assessing patterns of species diversity and endemism based on a dataset for the 10 temperate flowering plant families from the Indian Himalaya Region. Analysis was based on 818 grid cells (15 x 15') representing throughout the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). Based on the existing information on diverse aspects of the selected plant families four indices, i.e., species richness, weighted endemism, 1-4 cell endemism and corrected weighted endemism were developed and mapped for selected plant families. Analysis revealed that endemism is significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with species richness (1-4 cell endemic index: r = 0.85; weighted endemism; r = 0.58). On the basis of four different indices, potential areas have been identified for conservation. Data of each indices have been overlaid to each other for identification and prioritization of endemic rich areas in the Indian Himalayan Region.

ID COUNTS
AB The Arabian Leopard Panthera pardus nimr is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN and published information about this subspecies is scarce. We assessed the status of the species on the border of one of the most important remnants of its current range, the Dhofar mountain range. In this border area, the relative abundance of leopards (0.067 scats per kilometre) was found to be seven times lower than that reported from prime habitat areas in Dhofar. This result suggests that the leopard occurs in this border area in low numbers or uses it only intermittently. This is compatible with expected sub-optimal conditions found along the borders of the species' ranges. Furthermore, herders have reported that leopards used to be encountered more frequently in earlier times, which is also supportive evidence of higher vulnerability of this big cat along the edge of its distribution area. However, the habitat of the study area was found to be in relatively good condition, harbouring the leopard's main prey species and a number of regionally threatened large mammalian fauna, including the Nubian Ibex Capra nubiana, Arabian Gazelle Gazella gazella, Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis, Striped Hyaena Hyaena hyaena sultana, Caracal Caracal caracal schmitzi and Arabian Wolf Canis lupus arabs. Causes of the leopard decline in the area remain unclear, but given the availability of prey it is possible that human interference may have led to the retraction of the leopard's range.

AB Grazing can change plant community composition and structure, which may alter the functions of the shrub meadow ecosystem. Grazing effects on Potentilla fruticosa shrub community in the headwater region of the Yellow River, which is in core area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, are studied to provide adequate protection decision-making. We investigated continuous grazing and seasonal enclosure effects on P. fruticosa shrub communities. Three sites of P. fruticosa shrub comprising both continuous grazing and seasonal enclosure treatments were selected. The size of each fenced plot of P. fruticosa shrub was about 3000 m(2), the stocking rate was about 5 heads per 100 m(2) in continuous grazing treatment. Three samplings were made in each growing season of 2003 and 2004. Cover of vegetation, plant species composition and vegetation height were investigated in seven 1 x 1 m quadrates in each treatment. Above-ground biomass was measured in five 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrates. Shrub, forb, graminoid and sedge plant materials were clipped at ground level and oven-dried at 85 degrees C to a constant mass. Plant composition was affected by long term continuous grazing and changes were caused by forb species shifting. No apparent difference in species richness between the grazed and ungrazed communities over the growing months were found but the Shannon's diversity indices of the grazed communities in June and July were higher than that of the ungrazed but lower in the late August and September. Live vegetation cover was reduced by 6.7%, 7.3% and 11.5%, respectively, owing to grazing in July August and September, but not in June (P> 0.05). Forbs took up more than 50% cover of the vegetation in both grazed and ungrazed treatments. Relative cover of sedges and forbs in ungrazed treatment decreased in July, August and September, while that of graminoids increased more than 70% in the same period. Live vegetation height was reduced by 27% (2004) and 23% (2003) in late August and early September, but not in early growing season. Grazing reduced total above-ground biomass by 35%, 37% and 36% in July August and early September, respectively, and the reduction was mainly in forb biomass. Continuous grazing affects plant composition and species diversity. The quantitative characteristics of P. fruticosa communities were influenced by grazing over growing months, but the effects were offset by non-growing season grazing.

AB It is now well-known that introducing exotic species to an island carries environmental risks, as this can trigger a biological invasion. In Madagascar, the risk is aggravated by three factors: plant material is being introduced much more rapidly than any programmes to prevent invasion; the degree and frequency of human disturbance is facilitating plant invasions; biodiversity on the island is under severe threat. Our preliminary analysis of the status of 406 introduced species in Madagascar found that 12.8% were invasive in other countries, and that 39.2% carried an environmental risk of potential naturalisation. This article describes a shortlist of 19 species with a high environmental risk factor. Seven of these are known to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively, by suckering. To deal with the threat of invasion, a national management plan is needed to set priorities and then implement programmes for essential communication, research, prevention and early detection.

We hypothesized that the dredging activities affected the zooplankton communities and the hydrochemical conditions of the studied lakes. Significant differences in zooplankton abundance were found. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed that plankton communities were different between lakes and that the microcrustaceans largely contributed to the average dissimilarity. In particular, the lower densities of cladocerans and the presence of large-size species in the lake still under dredging during this study appeared to be related to the resuspension of sand in the water column. We report how the zooplankton communities evolved toward an higher taxonomical and functional diversity after conclusion of the dredging activities.

AB The composition and richness of woody species were experimentally tested in assemblages that were put together in order to evaluate - 18 months later - the combination that impacts several variables of woody community development the most and thus, its value on cloud forest rehabilitation. The experiment was conducted in an area of eastern Mexico characterized by cloud forest that had been severely damaged by plant cover removal and erosion as well as soil mixing and compacting caused by heavy machinery. Ten, 1-year-old, native woody species were employed to construct the assemblages. All species used in the experiment are native to eastern Mexican cloud forest, and each was included in at least two assemblages.
   More than half of the individuals that made up each assemblage succeeded in establishing and growing despite the dire condition of the study area; this was also true for 8 of the 10 species that made up assemblages. No evidence was found to suggest that assemblages affect development or survival at plot level, nor did the richness and composition of assemblages seem important in terms of community organization. However, in five species, assemblages were noted to influence some of the developmental variables analyzed, as the best performance came from the richest assemblage.
   The relative success of all assemblages and most individual species shows that it is possible to accelerate secondary succession in cloud forest by establishing assemblages of woody species juveniles. The results suggest that in this forest rehabilitation, any assemblage can be employed. Given the effects on each species, it is advisable to include the ones which exhibit the best survival and response under altered conditions in terms of crown size and height (Quercus, Carpinus, and Ulmus).

AB The reliability of basking counts as indices of relative abundance for Emys orbicularis was tested in a pond system in central Italy. For different field conditions regression was carried out between basking indices and population size estimates obtained by capture and recapture methods. Regression was particularly significant in midday hours of sunny days from May to July, suggesting that in these conditions basking counts can be used as indices of population size.

AB Food preference and fish-attractive parameters were studied on 1000 15- to 18-month-old Nile crocodiles, using two-choice preference tests.  All three experimental groups preferred live fish over dead fish and live chicks, while ground meat was the last choice.  As for fish attractiveness, motion, freshness, size, color and species were found as important parameters in the food-preference mechanism.  When new feeds were presented to naive, ground-meat-eating crocodiles, we could find out the nature of innate and learned food recognition.  Live fish, frogs and tadpoles were identified immediately as food, and the recognition of dead fish, chicks and anagmas required learning.

   mindsponge mechanism; wildlife consumption
ID ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE; DEMAND; BEHAVIOR; MARKET; PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE;

AB Biodiversity loss is happening at an unprecedented rate, especially in countries like Vietnam, with rich biodiversity and a high population growth rate. One of the main causes of biodiversity loss in Vietnam is the unsustainable bushmeat consumption rate in urban areas. To help mitigate the demand for bushmeat, this study aims to examine the associations between biodiversity loss perceptions, perception toward the prohibition of illegal wildlife consumption, and bushmeat consumption behaviors among urban residents in Vietnam. The investigation employed the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF)-an analytical framework that combines the strengths of the mindsponge mechanism and Bayesian inference to facilitate investigation into psychological and behavioral issues-on 535 respondents from urban areas across Vietnam (mostly in the two urban centers of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi). We found that people perceiving environmental degradation, and losses of economic growth, nature-based recreation opportunities, health, and knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss were more likely to support the prohibition of illegal wildlife consumption. Although urban residents tended to consume bushmeat less frequently if they perceived losses of economic growth and knowledge as consequences of biodiversity loss, the perception of environmental degradation had an opposite effect on the behavior. Additionally, people consuming bushmeat frequently and supporting the biodiversity loss preventive measure seemed to share similar features: high income and educational levels. These paradoxical results hint at the cultural additivity phenomenon-the willingness to incorporate into one's mind the new values that might or might not logically contradict their existing core cultural values-and its influence on psychology and behavior among Vietnamese urban residents. Given the influence of cultural additivity, it is recommended to put tougher measures (e.g., financial punishment) into perspective so that urban people can recognize the high "cost" of bushmeat consumption and change their perceptions and behaviors accordingly. Apart from that, social marketing, demarketing, or educational campaigns should convey knowledge and information that can help receivers relate biodiversity loss and bushmeat consumption to their subjective cost-benefit judgments rather than the rarity of the species to avoid triggering an anthropogenic Allee effect-for example, emphasizing the penalty for consuming bushmeat and negative impacts of biodiversity loss on humans in targeted campaigns (e.g., losses of economic growth and knowledge).

AB Biodiversity loss during the Anthropocene is a serious ecological challenge. Pollinators are important vectors that provide multiple essential ecosystem services but are declining rapidly in this changing world. However, several studies have argued that a high abundance of managed bee pollinators, such as honeybees (Apis mellifera), may be sufficient to provide pollination services for crop productivity, and sociological studies indicate that the majority of farmers worldwide do not recognize the contribution of wild pollinator diversity to agricultural yield. Here, we review the importance of pollinator diversity in natural and agricultural ecosystems that may be thwarted by the increase in abundance of managed pollinators such as honeybees. We also emphasize the additional roles diverse pollinator communities play in environmental safety, culture, and aesthetics. Research indicates that in natural ecosystems, pollinator diversity enhances pollination during environmental and climatic perturbations, thus allevi-ating pollen limitation. In agricultural ecosystems, pollinator diversity increases the quality and quantity of crop yield. Furthermore, studies indicate that many pollinator groups are useful in monitoring envi-ronmental pollution, aid in pest and disease control, and provide cultural and aesthetic value. During the uncertainties that may accompany rapid environmental changes in the Anthropocene, the conservation of pollinator diversity must expand beyond bee conservation. Similarly, the value of pollinator diversity maintenance extends beyond the provision of pollination services. Accordingly, conservation of polli-nator diversity requires an interdisciplinary approach with contributions from environmentalists, tax-onomists, and social scientists, including artists, who can shape opinions and behavior.Copyright (c) 2022 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB The distributions of marine ectotherms are governed by physiological sensitivities to long-term trends in seawater temperature and dissolved oxygen. Short-term variability in these parameters has the potential to facilitate rapid range expansions, and the resulting ecological and socioeconomic consequences may portend those of future marine communities. Here, we combine physiological experiments with ecological and demographic surveys to assess the causes and consequences of sudden but temporary poleward range expansions of a marine ectotherm with considerable life history plasticity (California market squid, Doryteuthis opalescens). We show that sequential factors related to resource accessibility in the core range-the buildup of large populations as a result of competitive release and climate-associated temperature increase and oxygen loss that constrain aerobic activity-may drive these expansions. We also reveal that poleward range expansion alters the body size-and therefore trophic role-of invading populations, with potential negative implications for socioeconomically valuable resident species. To help forecast rapid range expansions of marine ectotherms, we advocate that research efforts focus on factors impacting resource accessibility in core ranges. Determining how environmental conditions in receiving ecosystems affect body size and how body size is related to trophic role will help refine estimates of the impacts of future marine communities.

AB Southeast Tibet is significant in maintaining key ecological functions and providing irreplaceable ecosystem services but is also extremely vulnerable and susceptible to the impacts of human activities. Understanding the attitudes of local residents toward ecosystem conservation is considered essential for nature resource management. We therefore aimed to conduct an evaluation framework under hypothetical scenarios to measure communities' willingness to participate in ecosystem conservation using the contingent valuation method (CVM). Second, this study determined the underlying factors that might affect local's willingness to participate and then compared the willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to work (WTW) for different types of nature reserves. We found that income, education, community attachment, and acceptance of a payment scheme are significant factors determining the average amount that residents are willing to pay for ecosystem conservation, while their income, acceptance of a work scheme, and education are significant factors influencing the average service time that residents are willing to devote to work. Our results revealed that community residents have considerable willingness to participate in ecosystem conservation, which points not only to the great value attached to the ecosystem service function of Southeast Tibet nature but also suggests that people's willingness to participate is influenced by a conglomeration of socio-economic characteristics and their previous experience. The information herein can be used to implement conservation planning that involves community co-management and policymaking for sustainable development and will be beneficial to the dynamic conservation and adaptive management of Tibetan nature reserves.

AB Magnoliaceae, a primitive group of angiosperms and distinguished ornamental plants with more than 100 species in China, is one of the most threatened plant family in the wild due to logging, habitat loss, over-collection and climate change. To provide a scientific guide of its conservation for policymakers, we explore the diversity patterns of 114 Magnoliaceae species in China using three diversity indices (species richness, weighted endemism, beta-diversity) with a spatial resolution of 10 km by 10 km. Two methods, the top 5% richness algorithm and complementary algorithm, are used to identify diversity hotspots. Conservation gaps are recognized by overlapping the diversity hotspots with Chinese nature reserves. Our results indicate that Magnoliaceae species richness and weighted endemism are high in tropical to subtropical low montane forests in southern China, exceptionally high in southernmost Yunnan and boundary of Guizhou, Guangxi and Hunan. The beta-diversity are scattered in southern China, suggesting a different species composition among grid cells. We identify 2524 grids as diversity hotspots for Magnoliaceae species in China, with 24 grids covered by three diversity indices (first-level diversity hotspots), 561 grids covered by two indices (secondlevel diversity hotspots) simultaneously and 1939 grids (76.8%) covered by only one index (third-level diversity hotspots). The first-level diversity hotspots include over 70% of the critically endangered Magnoliaceae species and are the priority areas for Magnoliaceae conservation. However, only 24% of the diversity hotspots fall in nature reserves and only ten grids are from the first-level diversity hotspots. Zhejiang, Guizhou and Fujian have less than 20% of diversity hotspots covered by nature reserves and need attention in future Magnoliaceae conservation. Using multiple diversity indices and algorithms, our study identifies diversity hotspots and conservation gaps and provides scientific basis for Magnoliaceae conservation in future.

AB Human-induced climate- and land-use change have been affecting biogeographical and biodiversity patterns for the past two centuries all over the globe, resulting in increased extinction and biotic homogenization rates. High mountain ecosystems are more sensitive to these changes, which have led to physiological and phenological shifts, as well as to ecosystem processes' deformation. Glacial relicts, such as arctic-alpine taxa, are sensitive indicators of the effects of global warming and their rear-edge populations could include warm-adapted genotypes that might prove-conservation-wise-useful in an era of unprecedented climate regimes. Despite the ongoing thermophilization in European and Mediterranean summits, it still remains unknown how past and future climate-change might affect the distributional patterns of the glacial relict, arctic-alpine taxa occurring in Greece, their European southernmost distributional limit. Using species distribution models, we investigated the impacts of past and future climate changes on the arctic-alpine taxa occurring in Greece and identified the areas comprising arctic-alpine biodiversity hotspots in Greece. Most of these species will be faced with severe range reductions in the near future, despite their innate resilience to a multitude of threats, while the species richness hotspots will experience both altitudinal and latitudinal shifts. Being long-lived perennials means that there might be an extinction-debt present in these taxa, and a prolonged stability phase could be masking the deleterious effects of climate change on them. Several ex situ conservation measures (e.g., seed collection, population augmentation) should be taken to preserve the southernmost populations of these rare arctic-alpine taxa and a better understanding of their population genetics is urgently needed.

AB Human activity and climate change are increasing the spread of species across the planet, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Invasion engineers, such as birds, facilitate plant growth through manuring of soil, while native vegetation influences plant germination by creating suitable microhabitats which are especially valuable in cold and dry polar regions. Here we tested how penguin-derived nitrogen, several common Antarctic moss species and warming affect seed germination and growth of the non-native grass Agrostis capillaris under laboratory conditions. Experimental settings included a simulation of contemporary season-specific Antarctic light and temperature (2 degrees C) conditions and a +5 degrees C warming scenario. Mosses (Andreaea depressinervis, A. regularis, Sanionia uncinata and Chorisodontium aciphyllum) incorporated a range of nitrogen content and isotopic nitrogen signatures (delta N-15) due to variation in sampling proximity to penguin colonies. Moss species greatly affected time to germination with consequences for further growth under the simulated Antarctic conditions. Grass seeds germinated 10 days earlier among A. regularis compared to S. uncinata and C. aciphyllum and 26 days earlier compared to A. depressinervis. Moss-specific effects are likely related to microclimatic differences within the moss canopy. Warming reduced this moss influence. Grass emerged on average 20 days earlier under warming, leading to increased leaf count (88%), plant height (112%) and biomass (145%). Positive correlations were identified between moss and grass nitrogen content (r = 0.377), grass biomass (r = 0.332) and height (r = 0.742) with stronger effects under the warming scenario. Transfer of nitrogen from moss to grass was confirmed by delta N-15 (r = 0.803). Overall, the results suggest a shift from temperature-limited to N-limited growth of invasive plants under increased warming in the maritime Antarctic.

AB Background Algivorous sea urchins can obtain energy from a diet of a single algal species, which may result in consequent changes in their gut microbe assemblies and association networks. Methods To ascertain whether such changes are led by specific microbes or limited to a specific region in the gut, we compared the microbial assembly in the three major gut regions of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla elatensis when fed a mono-specific algal diet of either Ulva fasciata or Gracilaria conferta, or an algal-free diet. DNA extracts from 5 to 7 individuals from each diet treatment were used for Illumina MiSeq based 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region). Niche breadth of each microbe in the assembly was calculated for identification of core, generalist, specialist, or unique microbes. Network analyzers were used to measure the connectivity of the entire assembly and of each of the microbes within it and whether it altered with a given diet or gut region. Lastly, the predicted metabolic functions of key microbes in the gut were analyzed to evaluate their potential contribution to decomposition of dietary algal polysaccharides. Results Sea urchins fed with U. fasciata grew faster and their gut microbiome network was rich in bacterial associations (edges) and networking clusters. Bacteroidetes was the keystone microbe phylum in the gut, with core, generalist, and specialist representatives. A few microbes of this phylum were central hub nodes that maintained community connectivity, while others were driver microbes that led the rewiring of the assembly network based on diet type through changes in their associations and centrality. Niche breadth agreed with microbes' richness in genes for carbohydrate active enzymes and correlated Bacteroidetes specialists to decomposition of specific polysaccharides in the algal diets. Conclusions The dense and well-connected microbial network in the gut of Ulva-fed sea urchins, together with animal's rapid growth, may suggest that this alga was most nutritious among the experimental diets. Our findings expand the knowledge on the gut microbial assembly in T. gratilla elatensis and strengthen the correlation between microbes' generalism or specialism in terms of occurrence in different niches and their metabolic arsenal which may aid host nutrition.

AB Zoo- and phyto-parasitic nematodes of the order Rhabditida and zooparasites of the subclass Dorylaimia are well known, due largely to their medical, veterinarian and agricultural significance. However, there have been many switches from a free-living to a symbiotic (including parasitism) mode of existence in the evolutionary trajectories of various nematode clades. Here, we attempt to summarize all known cases of symbioses (from commensalism to true parasitism) between marine nematodes representing nonparasitic taxa and various larger animals, ranging from protists to vertebrates. Most cases are of nematodes relating to dwelling on crustaceans (ectocommensalism) or living in the body cavity and internal organs of various invertebrates (endoparasitism or parasitoidism). Ectocommensal species may differ from their free-living relatives in their longer filiform bodies and enlarged ventral and caudal glands, which may be interpreted as adaptations for the purpose of fixation on the body surface of a motile host. Endoparasitic species are characterized by deep anatomical modification, including rudimentation of the alimentary tract and hypertrophy of reproductive organs. Unlike terrestrial and limnetic invertebrates, marine invertebrates have almost no intestinal nematode dwellers. The evolutionary trajectories of nematode dwellers of marine and nonmarine invertebrates are compared.

A total of 31 representative Van Panchayat Forests (VPFs) in western Himalaya were investigated to assess: (i) the ecological condition, and (ii) their status of management. In addition review of available literature was also carried out to understand global trends of knowledge on CFs, and to specifically know the focus of studies on VPs in the study region. A total of 1158 documents on CFs were obtained, of which 91 pertained to VPs/VPFs. These 91 studies were considered for detail assessment. Analysis of published literature on VPFs indicated larger leaning towards management and governance. However, in recent years (2011 onward) a shift towards ecological processes and climate change mitigation was noticed. Overall, the studied VPFs indicated the deteriorating state of ecological health. However, the forests having proper management had better ecological health i.e., higher species richness, tree density and regeneration. Species richness and contribution of native species was found high in VPFs established before 1980. Analysis across the elevation range reveals higher level of disturbances in VPFs located below 1500 m asl. While higher elevation (above 1500 m asl) performing better both with respect to ecological health and management status. The findings of the study call for urgent attention to bring back the glory of VPFs through policy interventions. Analysis of literature and primary observation suggest that the VPFs in west Himalaya with their existence for over 9 decades are fading the glory due to mismatched policy and practice priorities. The scenario can be changed with appropriate interventions to make these VPFs more relevant for local people as well as the emerging global targets of conservation and sustainable development.

AB Rationale The diet of wild Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) is difficult to assess because they are cryptic and nocturnal predators that are extremely sensitive to disturbance by observers, and stomach content analysis is challenging, especially in large specimens. Stable light isotope analysis provides a means of assessing their diet, but diet-to-tissue discrimination factors have yet to be established for the species. Methods Isotope ratio (N-15/N-14 and C-13/C-12 expressed as delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses of scutes, claws, and blood of farmed crocodiles of different sizes were compared with the isotope values of their lifelong diet, which comprises chickens from a single supplier. Results Systematic size dependence in the diet-to-tissue discrimination factors for scute collagen, scute keratin, and claw keratin is described in regression relationships against the snout to vent length. Fixed values are presented for erythrocytes and blood plasma because blood was not sampled from juveniles. Conclusions The diet-to-tissue discrimination factors help assess the diet of wild crocodiles. The diet of crocodiles from Lake Flag Boshielo shows a clear ontogenic shift, as has been seen in other studies, and the results strongly indicate a dependence on the terrestrial food web rather than a fish diet. That this population may exploit a terrestrial diet highlights potential conflicts for conserving Nile crocodiles outside protected areas.

AB Behavioral innovation is believed to represent the ability of species to adapt to novel environments and to thus affect the observed establishment success of alien species in a new range. However, the relative importance of behavioral innovation in explaining alien species establishment among key event-, location-, and species-level factors remains poorly evaluated. In addition, the effects of technical innovation in food searching and handling techniques and consumer innovation in the use of new foods on establishment success are not clear. Here, based on a global dataset including information on 247 species across 9,899 successful and 2,370 failed introduction events spanning 199 countries or regions worldwide, we show that the behavioral innovation rate is a key factor facilitating alien bird establishment success after considering propagule pressure, climate matching, historical invasional meltdown, and life-history traits. Furthermore, we find that technical innovation is more influential than consumer innovation in explaining establishment success. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the effect of behavioral innovation on the establishment success of alien species in new ranges and may help predict the response of both native and alien species to accelerating global change during the Anthropocene.

AB Building a suitable soil is the foundation for successful revegetation and ecosystem development following disturbance. Mines produce large amounts of waste materials, which are important resources for soil building where it is lacking, although their potential on their own to support plants is often low. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of built micro topography, organic amendments and an anionic polymer erosion control product (Soil Lynx) in improving plant community establishment on substrates of diamond mine waste materials (crushed rock, processed kimberlite, lakebed sediment) in the Northwest Territories, Canada. In general, micro topography and organic amendments worked independently to enhance revegetation. Built micro topography only enhanced plant establishment on processed kimberlite with highest plant density, cover and height in depressions. Plant response was considerably less on this substrate than on the others. Crushed rock had at least eight times the plant density and cover of processed kimberlite and double that of lakebed sediment. Sewage sludge incorporated 5-10 cm into surface substrates significantly improved plant establishment, growth and frequency of seed heads. Soil Lynx provided no benefit for plants. After 4 years, crushed rock with sewage sludge showed the greatest potential for use in reclamation. Seeded grasses dominated all treatments, although moss and lichen cover were increasing with time on crushed rock. Gravel disturbances are common in arctic regions and the ability to accelerate plant community development through use of novel soil building materials can ensure ecosystem resilience.

AB Management of tree cover, either to curb bush encroachment or to mitigate losses of woody cover to over-browsing, is a major concern in savanna ecosystems. Once established, trees are often "trapped" as saplings, since interactions among disturbance, plant competition, and precipitation delay sapling recruitment into adult size classes. Saplings can be directly suppressed by wildlife browsing and competition from adjacent plants, and indirectly facilitated by grazers, such as cattle, which feed on neighboring grasses. Yet few experimental studies have simultaneously quantified the effects of cattle and wildlife on sapling growth, particularly over long time scales. We used a series of replicated 4-ha herbivore-manipulation plots to investigate the net effects of wildlife and moderate cattle grazing on Acacia drepanolobium sapling growth over 10 years that encompassed extended wet and dry periods. We also simulated more intense cattle grazing using grass removal treatments (0.5-m radius around saplings), and we quantified the role of intraspecific tree competition using neighborhood tree surveys (trees within a 3-m radius). Wildlife, which included elephants, had a positive effect on sapling growth. Wildlife also reduced neighbor tree density during the 10-yr study, which likely caused the positive effect of wildlife on saplings. Although moderate cattle grazing did not affect sapling growth, grass removal treatments simulating heavy grazing increased sapling growth. Both grass removal and neighbor tree effects on saplings were strongest during above-average rainfall years following drought. This highlights that livestock-driven reductions in grass cover and catastrophic wildlife damage to trees during droughts present a need, or an opportunity, for targeted management of sapling growth and woody plant cover during ensuing wet periods.

AB Alien invasive Australian tree species are most prevalent in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), a global biodiversity hotspot. The plants pose a serious threat as they have replaced indigenous riparian forest vegetation, including many native tree species such as Brabejum stellatifolium and Metrosideros angustifolia along many watercourses. Black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) is a leguminous nitrogen fixer which makes significant contributions to available nitrogen in its new habitats in the fynbos, which is generally low in nutrients. However, the magnitude and the timing of litter associated nutrient input into riparian forests and woodlands and adjacent aquatic environments are not known. In this study, we assessed patterns of leaf litterfall, nutrient return to soil and resorption (N and P) of A. mearnsii and two co-occurring native species in two perennial streams in the Mediterranean-type Fynbos biome of the CFR. Leaf litterfall of A. mearnsii in the riparian forests was significantly greater compared to native vegetation, with two peaks in litterfall, one in mid-autumn, and the other in mid-summer at both streams. In contrast, the native vegetation only dropped leaves in the summer month of December. Acacia mearnsii also returned substantially more nutrients (N and P) during the peak leaf litterfall period (December) than cooccurring native species. However, the co-occurring native species were more efficient in the resorption of nutrients (N and P), with average resorption higher than the global averages of 52% for N and 50% for P. In contrast, A. mearnsii was relatively inefficient in resorbing N (30% mean N resorption) but was more efficient in resorbing P (76% mean P resorption). In addition to fixing N, it is possible that the A. mearnsii stands rely on the return of nutrient-rich leaf litter to soils and through specialized root systems and root symbionts assisting reuse of nutrients. The results highlight the differences in the nutritional economy between native riparian forest species and invasive A. mearnsii. Our findings provide further insight into the success of invasive leguminous woody tree species in nutrient-poor Mediterranean riparian forests.

AB The Eastern Mediterranean Sea hosts more non-indigenous species than any other marine region, yet their impacts on the native biota remain poorly understood. Focusing on mollusks from the Israeli rocky intertidal, we explored the hypothesis that this abiotically harsh habitat supports a limited trait diversity, and thus may promote niche overlap and competition between native and non-indigenous species. Indeed, native and non indigenous assemblage components often had a highly similar trait composition, caused by functionally similar native (Patella caerulea) and non-indigenous (Cellana rota) limpets. Body size of P. caerulea decreased with increasing C. rota prevalence, but not vice versa, indicating potential asymmetric competition. Although both species have coexisted in Israel for >15 years, a rapid 'replacement' of native limpets by C. rota has been reported for a thermally polluted site, suggesting that competition and regionally rapid climate-related seawater warming might interact to progressively erode native limpet performance along the Israeli coast.

AB Studies on endemism are always of high interest in biogeography and contribute to better understanding of the evolution of species and making conservation plans. The present study aimed to investigate the endemism patterns of planthoppers in China by delimiting centers of endemism and areas of endemism. We collected 6,907 spatial distribution records for 860 endemic planthopper species from various resources. Centers of endemism were identified using weighted endemism values at 1 degrees grid size. Parsimony analysis of endemicity and endemicity analysis were employed to detect areas of endemism at 1 degrees, 1.5 degrees, and 2 degrees grid sizes. Six centers of endemism located in mountainous areas were identified: Taiwan Island, Hainan Island, eastern Yungui Plateau, Wuyi Mountains, western Qinling Mountains, and western Yunnan. We also delimited six areas of endemism, which were generally consistent with centers of endemism. Our findings demonstrated that mountainous areas have an essential role in facilitating the high level of endemism and formation of areas of endemism in planthoppers through the combined effects of complex topography, a long-term stable environment, and geological events. Dispersal ability and distribution of host plants also have important effects on the patterns of planthoppers' endemism.

AB We assessed long-term impacts of multiple stressors and their interaction on the zooplankton community of the large, eutrophic, cyanobacteria-dominated Lake Peipsi (Estonia, Russia). Stressor dataset consisted in time series (1997-2018) of temperature, nutrients, pH, water transparency, phytoplankton biomass and taxonomic richness. The best predictors were selected with random forests machine-learning algorithms and the subsequent models were constructed with generalized linear modeling. We also aimed to identify graphical thresholds representing non-linear, marked responses of abundance or biomass to stressors. Temperature was the dominant stressor for explaining zooplankton abundance and biomass, followed by cyanobacteria biomass, total nitrogen concentration and water transparency. The effect of water temperature was positive, whereas the effect of cyanobacteria became negative after their biomass exceeded a threshold of similar to 2 mg l(-1). However, the two stressors together had antagonistic effects on zooplankton, causing a decrease in biomass and abundance. For zooplankton, critical thresholds of total nitrogen (similar to 700 mu g l(-1)), total phosphorus (similar to 70 mu g l(-1)), and water transparency (similar to 1.4 m) after which zooplankton metrics changed drastically, were determined. These findings show that although lake warming alone could be positive for zooplankton, the necessity of reducing interacting stressors that influence harmful cyanobacteria growth and biomass, especially nitrogen loads, must be considered.

AB The Milne Bay Region of southeasternmost Papua New Guinea comprises a small portion of mainland New Guinea and several offshore islands, totaling 15,000 km(2) in land area. I numerically summarize the literature and findings from my field surveys of the region's herpetofauna and show that it contains the greatest known assemblage of range-restricted endemic herpetofauna globally for such a small area. Further, most of these species occupy only one or two of 11 small areas of local endemism within the region. I compare the number and density of endemic herpetofauna in the Milne Bay Region to other regions of notable endemic biodiversity and find it to be far larger than that in the large majority of these other "hotspots", despite the much larger sizes of those areas. Herpetofaunal surveys within the Milne Bay Region are more complete than for other taxa, but it is clear that this region holds a large trove of range-restricted endemic species within less well-studied groups too. The driver of this endemic diversity is the ongoing geological dismemberment and uplift of the region resulting from the opening of the Woodlark Rift. Prior ignorance of the biodiversity importance of this region stems from decades of classifying New Guinea as a "tropical wilderness area", which has deprived that region of the conservation focus accorded the more famous "hotspots". One effect of this is that some of the areas of local endemism identified here are under immediate pressure for habitat conversion, especially Woodlark Island, which is threatened by both mining and virtually complete conversion to oil palm, posing a high extinction risk for scores of endemic species.

AB The second part of a taxonomic revision of the tribe Barlerieae (Acanthaceae) in Angola and Namibia covers Barleria sects. Somalia and Stellatohirta. Thirty-one taxa including 27 accepted species are treated. Four new species (Barleria eburnea, B. imatensis, B. louiseana and B. thunbergiiflora), one new subspecies (B. kacondensis subsp. glabrescens) and one new variety (B. violascens var. humpatana) are described. In addition, B. taitensis S.Moore var. occidentalis S.Moore is elevated to subspecies status and B. newtonii Lindau is resurrected as a distinct species endemic to the Lubango Highlands of Angola. Full descriptions, citations of types and representative specimens, and notes on their habitat(s), ecology and biogeography are provided for each taxon. Thirteen names in Barleria are lectotypified and a neotype is selected for B. newtonii. A preliminary assessment of the conservation status and extinction risk is provided for each taxon. Of the 31 taxa enumerated, five are assessed as Endangered, two as Vulnerable, two as Near Threatened, and 13 are of Least Concern, whilst nine are currently considered to be Data Deficient. This contribution completes our revision of Barleria in Angola and Namibia, with 59 accepted species, four additional subspecies, four additional varieties and two incompletely known taxa documented in total. A remarkable 75% of the taxa are endemic or near-endemic to Angola and Namibia.

ID ANALYSIS MODEL; PANTHERA-LEO; CONSERVATION; TRADE
AB Simple Summary In South Africa, African lions (Panthera leo) are bred on farms for commercial purposes such as tourism, trophy hunting, and the international traditional medicine market. Despite its legal status, South Africa's growing lion farming industry is a contentious issue. In 2020, a high-level panel was appointed to review the policies, legislation, and management of breeding, hunting, trade, and handling of four wildlife species, namely rhino, elephant, leopard, and lions. In May 2021, it was announced that the government will stop issuing permits to new entrants into this industry as well as the issuance of hunting permits and will start amending permit conditions to prohibit breeding and exclude tourism interactions with captive lions, effectively ending the lion farming industry. In order to follow this line of action, a comprehensive, well-managed plan will be required to ensure a responsible transition away from the current industry. Here, using a "gap analysis" management tool, we outline some of the key considerations necessary for a responsible, well-managed exit from the lion farming industry in South Africa. We compiled key background information about the current state of the industry and use this information to identify desired management states and specific steps that could facilitate a successful phase out of lion farming. African lions (Panthera leo) are commercially farmed across South Africa for sport hunting, tourism, and the international bone trade, primarily in Southeast Asia. Despite its legal status, South Africa's growing lion farming industry is a contentious issue. In 2020 a high-level panel was initiated to review the policies, legislation, and management regarding the breeding, hunting, trade, and handling of four wildlife species, including lions. In May 2021, it was announced that the government intends to amend existing permit conditions to prohibit lion breeding and tourism interactions with captive lions, as well as to stop issuing permits to new entrants into the industry, effectively ending lion farming. In order to follow this line of action, a comprehensive, well-managed plan will be necessary to execute a responsible exit from the industry as it currently stands. Using a "gap analysis" management tool, we aim to: (1) outline some of the key considerations regarding the current state of the lion farming industry in South Africa; and (2) propose specific action steps that could be taken within five key areas (regulation, animal welfare, health and safety, equitability, and conservation) to help inform a responsible transition away from this type of wildlife farming in the biodiversity economy. For our gap analysis, we conducted a semi-systematic literature search to compile key background information about the current state of the industry. This information was then used to identify corresponding desired management states, and steps that could facilitate a successful phase out of lion farming in South Africa. We hope our approach helps identify key considerations for a responsible transition and can help aid decisions during the management of this process.

AB Aquatic organisms rely on microbial symbionts for coping with various challenges they encounter during stress and for defending themselves against predators, pathogens and parasites. Microbial symbionts are also often indispensable for the host's development or life cycle completion. Many aquatic ecosystems are currently under pressure due to diverse human activities that have a profound impact on ecosystem functioning. These human activities are also expected to alter interactions between aquatic hosts and their associated microbes. This can directly impact the host's health and-given the importance and widespread occurrence of microbial symbiosis in aquatic systems-the ecosystem at large. In this review, we provide an overview of the importance of microbial symbionts for aquatic organisms, and we consider how the beneficial services provided by microbial symbionts can be affected by human activities. The scarcity of available studies that assess the functional consequences of human impacts on aquatic microbial symbioses shows that our knowledge on this topic is currently limited, making it difficult to draw general conclusions and predict future changes in microbial symbiont-host relationships in a changing world. To address this important knowledge gap, we provide an overview of approaches that can be used to assess the impact of human disturbances on the functioning of aquatic microbial symbioses.

AB Invasive plants form new ecological links with native biota that can affect soil animals. Giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea Aiton) of the Asteraceae family originates in North America, but it is an invasive plant elsewhere in the world. We studied the belowground arthropod communities of invasive S. gigantea and native vegetation at three sites near Moscow, Russia. Molecular techniques allow for quick identification of the community composition but provide little information on the abundance of soil animals and should be verified by classical taxonomy methods. Thus, we identified soil arthropods using metabarcoding and morphological identification. The number of arthropod families identified by the two methods was comparable (53 and 56, respectively), with a significant correlation in the number of families detected in individual samples based on morphological and metabarcoding approaches. The structure of the belowground arthropod community was subtly different between the goldenrod and control sites. A goldenrod transplant experiment was designed to control the random factors that created site-specific variation. After one year, the abundance and diversity of soil arthropods remained the same in sites with transplanted goldenrod and the control plots, leading to the conclusion that invasive S. gigantea does not affect soil arthropod communities in this region.

TI Connectivity of coastal and neritic fish larvae to the deep waters
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Four ichthyoplankton cruises and backward tracking experiments were conducted to study the connectivity of coastal and neritic fish larvae over the continental slope and to the oceanic deep-water region of the western Gulf of Mexico. Distribution patterns of larval abundance at oceanic stations showed higher abundance and the presence of larvae at oceanic stations during two cruises. Larval transport was simulated using outputs of a data assimilation model that represented the flow conditions during each cruise. Higher abundances of larvae of coastal and neritic species at oceanic stations agreed with offshore transport inferred from numerical experiments seeding particles over different spatial scales (stations vs. transects). Satellite images of surface chlorophyll were consistent with the circulation patterns indicated by the model, indicating filaments of shelf waters were transported toward the transects with higher larval abundances. Particle tracking experiments indicated that the northwestern shelf provinces of Perdido, Tamaulipas, and Texas were the main source of propagules to the oceanic region, while shelf provinces of northern Veracruz, Campeche, Yucatan, Louisiana, and Mississippi-Alabama contributed much less. The length and intensity of the shelf front limited ichthyoplankton cross-shelf exchange during some cruises, and mesoscale anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies advected larvae to the deep-water region during others. The agreement between the spatial distribution of fish larvae and the simulated larval transport confirm that circulation models are a valuable tool for examining potential dispersal pathways of neritic species, as long as similar spatial and temporal scales as the ones used in this study are considered.

AB The growing invasion of ecosystems by invasive alien plants (IAPs) has substantially affected biodiversity worldwide, compromising provision of ecosystem services. In this study, we present evidence of the impacts of an IAP, Robinia pseudoacacia L., on native plant diversity in montane rangelands of South Africa and its threats to grazing, an ecosystem service. We assessed stand characteristics, understory vegetation composition and rangeland condition similarities in invaded and uninvaded sites. We observed a shift in grass communities after invasion by R. pseudoacacia as invaded communities differed by 96% from uninvaded rangeland. Invaded habitat was dominated by nitrophilous, shade-tolerant alien ruderals that follow the primitive C-3 carbon fixation pathway. Nitrogen fixation and light-demanding properties of R. pseudoacacia are likely to be the main factors driving these changes. As a result, range condition was significantly lower in invaded habitats with smaller and dense trees (180 +/- 24.3) (mean +/- standard error) when compared with adjacent uninvaded habitat (401 +/- 24.3). These preliminary findings support an urgent need for sustainable control of R. pseudoacacia as an effective approach to stop further reduction in grazing capacity and losses in livestock production.

AB Nutrient availability, especially of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), is of major importance for every organism and at a larger scale for ecosystem functioning and productivity. Changes in nutrient availability and potential stoichiometric imbalance due to anthropogenic nitrogen deposition might lead to nutrient deficiency or alter ecosystem functioning in various ways. In this study, we present 6 years (2014-2020) of flux-, plant-, and remote sensing data from a large-scale nutrient manipulation experiment conducted in a Mediterranean savanna-type ecosystem with an emphasis on the effects of N and P treatments on ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency (WUE) and related mechanisms. Two plots were fertilized with N (NT, 16.9 Ha) and N + P (NPT, 21.5 Ha), and a third unfertilized plot served as a control (CT). Fertilization had a strong impact on leaf nutrient stoichiometry only within the herbaceous layer with increased leaf N in both fertilized treatments and increased leaf P in NPT. Following fertilization, WUE in NT and NPT increased during the peak of growing season. While gross primary productivity similarly increased in NT and NPT, transpiration and surface conductance increased more in NT than in NPT. The results show that the NPT plot with higher nutrient availability, but more balanced N:P leaf stoichiometry had the highest WUE. On average, higher N availability resulted in a 40% increased leaf area index (LAI) in both fertilized treatments in the spring. Increased LAI reduced aerodynamic conductance and thus evaporation at both fertilized plots in the spring. Despite reduced evaporation, annual evapotranspiration increased by 10% (48.6 +/- 28.3 kg H2O m(-2)), in the NT plot, while NPT remained similar to CT (-1%, -6.7 +/- 12.2 kgH(2)O m(-2)). Potential causes for increased transpiration at NT could be increased root biomass and thus higher water uptake or rhizosphere priming to increase P-mobilization through microbes. The annual net ecosystem exchange shifted from a carbon source in CT (75.0 +/- 20.6 gC m(-2)) to carbon-neutral in both fertilized treatments [-7.0 +/- 18.5 gC m(-2) (NT) 0.4 +/- 22.6 gC m(-2) (NPT)]. Our results show, that the N:P stoichiometric imbalance, resulting from N addition (without P), increases the WUE less than the addition of N + P, due to the strong increase in transpiration at NT, which indicates the importance of a balanced N and P content for WUE.

AB Processes driving the divergence of floral traits may be integral to the extraordinary richness of flowering plants and the assembly of diverse plant communities. Several models of pollinator-mediated floral evolution have been proposed; floral divergence may (i) be directly involved in driving speciation or may occur after speciation driven by (ii) drift or local adaptation in allopatry or (iii) negative interactions between species in sympatry. Here, we generate predictions for patterns of trait divergence and community assembly expected under these three models, and test these predictions in Hakea (Proteaceae), a diverse genus in the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. We quantified functional richness for two key floral traits (pistil length and flower color), as well as phylogenetic distances between species, across ecological communities, and compared these to patterns generated from null models of community assembly. We also estimated the statistical relationship between rates of trait evolution and lineage diversification across the phylogeny. Patterns of community assembly suggest that flower color, but not floral phenology or morphology, or phylogenetic relatedness, is more divergent in communities than expected. Rates of lineage diversification and flower color evolution were negatively correlated across the phylogeny and rates of flower colour evolution were positively related to branching times. These results support a role for diversity-dependent species interactions driving floral divergence during the Hakea radiation, contributing to the development of the extraordinary species richness of southwest Australia.

AB Invasive alien species threaten tropical grasslands and native biodiversity across the globe, including in the natural mosaic of native grasslands and forests in the Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats. Here, grasslands have been lost to exotic tree invasion (Acacias, Eucalyptus, and Pines) since the 1950s, but differing invasion intensities between these species and intermixing with native species constitutes a major challenge for remotely sensed assessments. In this study, we assess the accuracy of three satellite and airborne remote sensing sensors (Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data and AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data) and three machine learning classification algorithms to identify the spatial extent of native habitats and invasive tree species. We used the support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest (RF) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. Results indicate that AVIRIS-NG data in combination with SVM produced the highest classification accuracy (98.7%). Fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 produce 91% accuracy, while Sentinel-2 alone yielded 91% accuracy; but only with higher coverage of ground control points. The hyperspectral data (AVIRIS-NG) was the only sensor that permitted distinguishing recent invasions (young trees) with high precision. We suspect that large areas will have to be mapped and assessed in the coming years by conservation managers, NGOs to plan restoration or to assess the success of restoration activities, for which a choice of sensors may have to be made based on the age of invasion being mapped, and the quantum of ground control data available.

AB Arthropods are the most diversified animals on Earth. The morphology of the digestive system has been widely studied in insects; however, crustaceans have received comparatively little attention. This study describes the hindgut tract of the common spider crab Maja brachydactyla Balss, 1922, in larvae and adults using dissection, light and electron microscopical analyses. The hindgut tract maintains a similar general shape in larvae and adults. Major differences among stages are found in the morphology of epithelial cells and microspines, the thickness of the cuticle and connective-like tissue, and the presence of rosette glands (only in adults). Here, we provide the description of the sub-cellular structure of the folds, epithelium (conformed by tendon cells), musculature, and microspines of the hindgut of larvae and adults of M. brachydactyla. The morphological features of the hindgut of M. brachydactyla are compared with those of other arthropods (Insecta, Myriapoda and Arachnida). Our results suggest that the morphology of the hindgut is associated mainly with transport of faeces. In adults, the hindgut may also exert an osmoregulatory function, as described in other arthropods. At difference from holometabolous insets, the hindgut of M. brachydactyla (Decapoda) does not undergo a true metamorphic change during development, but major changes observed between larval and adult stages might respond to the different body size between life stages.

AB Context Reduced connectivity across grassland ecosystems can impair their functional heterogeneity and negatively impact large herbivore populations. Maintaining landscape connectivity across human-dominated rangelands is therefore a key conservation priority. Objective Integrate data on large herbivore occurrence and species richness with analyses of functional landscape connectivity to identify important areas for maintaining or restoring connectivity for large herbivores. Methods The study was conducted on a landscape with a mosaic of multiple land uses in Laikipia County, Kenya. We used occupancy estimates for four herbivore species [African elephant (Loxodonta africana), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), plains zebra (Equus quagga), and Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi)] and species richness estimates derived from aerial surveys to create resistance surfaces to movement for single species and a multi-species assemblage, respectively. We validated single-species resistance surfaces using telemetry data. We used circuit theory and least cost-path analyses to model linkage zones across the landscape and prioritize areas for connectivity restoration. Results Resistance layers approximated the movements of our focal species. Results for single-species and multi-species connectivity models were highly correlated (r(p) > 0.9), indicating similar spatial patterns of functional connectivity between individual species and the larger herbivore assemblage. We identified critical linkage zones that may improve permeability to large-herbivore movements. Conclusion Our analysis highlights the utility of aerial surveys in modeling landscape connectivity and informing conservation management when animal movement data are scarce. Our results can guide management decisions, providing valuable information to evaluate the trade-offs between improving landscape connectivity and safeguarding livelihoods with electrified fences across rangelands.

AB Pet trading and keeping globally involves at least 13,0 0 0 species, and at least 350 million individual non-domesticated or "wild pet" animals annually. In addition, over 445 million domesticated dogs and cats are thought to occupy homes worldwide. Several major problematic concerns are associated with pet keeping, in particular linked to nondomesticated or wild pet forms, including: animal welfare; species conservation; public health and safety; antimicrobial resistance; agricultural animal health; invasive alien organism introductions; and poor information uptake by the public. Regulation of both domesticated and wild pets characteristically involves negative list systems, under which all trading and keeping problems continue to burgeon. Negative lists involve the itemization of animal types that are monitored, restricted or banned in the context of trading and keeping, with all nonlisted animals essentially being unregu-lated. In contrast, positive lists involve the itemization of animal types that are permitted for trading and keeping, with all nonlisted animals essentially being barred. Compelling rationales, as well as an important scientific evidence-base, strongly indicate replacement of historically common negative list ap-proaches with objective positive list systems to better regulate the sale and keeping of both wild pet and domesticated pet animals. This report aims to produce a novel method for developing positive lists that meets several criteria that we considered to be fundamental to a robust decision-making protocol: operational objectivity; quantitative algorithm design; no or negligible consensus-based decision-making; binary results; independent repeatability; user-friendliness; resource efficiency; optional use alongside other methods.

AB Legumes (family Leguminosae) are an economically important and widely distributed species found in several regions of the world, including the Guineo-Congolian (GC) forest region. Recent studies have reported the impact of climate change on plant biodiversity. Thus, understanding the distribution pattern of the endemic legume species of the GC region under current and future climate scenarios are imperative for long-term conservation management plans. We used 762 occurrence data of the 237 endemic legume species to elucidate the habitat suitability and impact of climate change on the species. Analyses used an ecological niche modeling ensemble method to map the current and future (2050-2070) distribution patterns of the endemic legumes under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Further, we generated the ensemble of four different species distribution modeling methods to predict areas where climatically suitable regions is lost or gained under future climate change. The model predicted the current suitable areas for endemic legumes to be Southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo (COG), and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Our findings indicate precipitation of Warmest Quarter and seasonality as the significant climatic variables affecting the habitat suitability of endemic legumes in the GC regions. Results showed areas such as the coastal region of Cote d' Ivoire, southwest province of Cameroon, Central African Republic, COG (Ngounnie), central DRC, and southern Nigeria will experience >40% loss of climatically suitable areas by 2050. Also, species such as Baphia maxima, and Psophocarpus scandens were projected to experience a 70% reduction in their climatically suitable areas under future climate scenarios. Our study concludes that the projected distribution of the endemic legume species in the GC region will consequently decline in the future due to the gross effect of climate change. The anticipated changes in the distribution patterns of the endemic legumes could have significant ecological and socio-economic significance. Therefore, we recommend improved conservation to protect the endemic legume species and its associated habitats in GC forest.

AB An experimental trial was conducted for 90 days to evaluate the effect of different carbon sources viz. yam and potato on growth performance of milkfish (Chanos chanos) in biofloc-based system. Milkfish fry (average body weight of 0.66 +/- 0.01 g) was stocked in biofloc treatments, yam-based biofloc (BFY) and potato-based biofloc (BFP), and clear water (CW) as control in triplicates. Milkfish reared in biofloc-based units obtained significantly better (p < 0.05) performance in terms of growth, digestive enzyme activity and survival when compared to clear water control. Among the biofloc-based treatments, the highest average body weight (11.62 +/- 0.24 g), specific growth rate (3.21 +/- 0.01% day(-1)), percentage weight gain (1688.10 +/- 19.05) and survival (90.83 +/- 2.01%) were found in BFY group. Similarly, the essential amino acid and non-essential amino acid contents of biofloc and experimental fish were higher in BFY as compared to BFP. Additionally, the highest level of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and total n-6 and n-3 PUFA were found higher in BFY. Bacterial composition analysis showed that BFY treatment groups had a more diverse bacterial community than those with BFP treatment groups. This study demonstrated that biofloc-based culture system is suitable for rearing of C. chanos fry and the most preferable type of carbon source is found to be Yam.

AB Intensive cocoa production in Cote d'Ivoire, the world's leading cocoa producer, has grown at the expense of forest cover. To reverse this trend, the country has adopted a "zero deforestation" agricultural policy and committed to rehabilitating its forest cover through the planting of high-value tree species in cocoa landscapes using a participatory approach. However, little is known regarding the factors influencing farmers' introduction of high-value tree species to cocoa landscapes. We tested the hypothesis that ten previously reported factors to influence agroforestry system adoption to predict the number and choice of tree species that farmers introduce to cocoa farms. We interviewed 683 households in the cocoa-producing zone of Cote d'Ivoire and counted tree species on their cocoa farms. On average, two tree species were recorded per surveyed farm. Generalized Poisson regression models revealed that, in the cocoa production area, experience in tree planting and expected benefits, including income and food, influence tree species introduction through planting or "retention" when clearing land for cocoa establishment. The age of the farmer also influenced (p = 0.017) farmers' tree species planting on cocoa farms. Fewer tree species were introduced into current intensive cocoa-production areas than in "old cocoa-loops" and forested areas. The number of tree species introduced to cocoa farms increased with expected benefits and experience in tree planting. The number of planted tree species also increased with farmers' age. Tree species were mostly selected for the provision of shade to cocoa, production of useful tree products (38%), and income from the sale of these products (7%). Fruit tree species were the most planted, while timber tree species were mostly spared when clearing land for cocoa production.

AB Arid ecosystems are strongly limited by water availability, and precipitation plays a major role in the dynamics of all species in arid regions, as well as the ecosystem processes that occur there. However, understanding how biotic interactions mediate long-term responses of dryland ecosystems to rainfall remains very fragmented. We report on a unique large-scale field experiment spanning 25 yr and three trophic levels (plants, small mammal herbivores, predators) in a dryland ecosystem in the northern Chilean Mediterranean Region where we assessed how biotic interactions influence the long-term plant community responses to precipitation. As the most persistent ecological changes in dryland systems may result from changes in the structure, cover, and composition of the perennial vegetation, we emphasized the interplay between bottom-up and top-down controls of perennial plants in our analyses. Rainfall was the primary factor affecting the dynamics of, and interactions among, plants and small mammals. Ephemeral plant cover dynamics closely tracked short-term annual rainfall, but seemed unaffected by top-down controls (herbivory). In contrast, the response of the perennial plant cover to precipitation was mediated by (1) a complex interplay between subtle top-down (herbivory) controls that become more apparent in the long-term, (2) competition with ephemeral plants during wet years, and (3) an indirect effect of predators on subdominant shrubs and perennial herbs. This long-term field experiment highlights how climate-induced responses of arid perennial vegetation are influenced by interactions across trophic levels and temporal scales. In the face of global change, understanding how multi-trophic controls mediate dryland vegetation responses to climate is essential to properly managing the conservation of biodiversity in arid systems.

AB Population time series analysis is an integral part of conservation biology in the current context of global changes. To quantify changes in population size, wildlife counts only provide estimates because of various sources of error. When unaccounted for, such errors can obscure important ecological patterns and reduce confidence in the derived trend. In the case of highly gregarious species, which are common in the animal kingdom, the estimation of group size is an important potential bias, which is characterized by high variance among observers. In this context, it is crucial to quantify the impact of observer changes, inherent to population monitoring, on i) the minimum length of population time series required to detect significant trends and ii) the accuracy (bias and precision) of the trend estimate.
   We acquired group size estimation error data by an experimental protocol where 24 experienced observers conducted counting simulation tests on group sizes. We used this empirical data to simulate observations over 25 years of a declining population distributed over 100 sites. Five scenarios of changes in observer identity over time and sites were tested for each of three simulated trends (true population size evolving according to deterministic models parameterized with declines of 1.1%, 3.9% or 7.4% per year that justify respectively a "declining," "vulnerable" or "endangered" population under IUCN criteria).
   We found that under realistic field conditions observers detected the accurate value of the population trend in only 1.3% of the cases. Our results also show that trend estimates are similar if many observers are spatially distributed among the different sites, or if one single observer counts all sites. However, successive changes in observer identity over time lead to a clear decrease in the ability to reliably estimate a given population trend, and an increase in the number of years of monitoring required to adequately detect the trend.
   Minimizing temporal changes of observers improve the quality of count data and help taking appropriate management decisions and setting conservation priorities. The same occurs when increasing the number of observers spread over 100 sites. If the population surveyed is composed of few sites, then it is preferable to perform the survey by one observer. In this context, it is important to reconsider how we use estimated population trend values and potentially to scale our decisions according to the direction and duration of estimated trends, instead of setting too precise threshold values before action.

AB Invasive plant introductions are increasing globally, and trends in human activity suggest these increases will continue. Although we know much about interactions between invasive herbaceous plants and arthropod communities, there is a dearth of knowledge examining interactions between invasive woody plants and arthropod communities. What information does exist shows that invasive woody plant relationships with mutualists (e.g., pollinators), herbivores, twig- and stem-borers, leaf-litter and soil-dwelling arthropods, and other arthropod groups are complex and hint at multiple factors influencing effects. These relationships warrant additional attention to allow better prioritization of species for research and regulatory review. Chinese tallow tree, e.g., is renowned for its attractiveness to honeybees, whereas reduced pollinator populations are found among other invasive woody plants such as privet. The unknown driving mechanisms and interactions that create these differences represent a substantial gap in knowledge and warrant additional research. Our objectives are to review current knowledge regarding invasive woody plants and their interactions with various arthropod groups in the United States, outline future research needs, and present a call to action regarding invasive woody plant research.

AB This investigation revealed that there are 42 species belonging to fifteen families in eleven governorates of KSA. The highest number (seven) and percentage (20.60%) of introduced species were recorded in Dammam and Riyadh, while, the lowest values were recorded in the regions of Al-Baha, Al-Ghat and Jizan (one and 2.94%). As for Al-Baha a large number of introduced species (nineteen, 46.34%) were recorded, nearly half of the number of species examined, while no invasive species were recorded in Bisha, Dammam, and Tabuk. The life growth of the introduced species ranges from trees to young weeds. Phanerophytes (45%) had the highest proportion of life expectancy for the introduced plants, followed by Therophyte (40%) and Chamaephytes (15%), while the highest percentage (63%) among life ratios of the introduced and invasive plants was recorded for Therophyte, and the percentage of life growth of introduced plants indicates the dominance of herbs among other life forms. Regarding the total growth of life, the highest recorded percentage was in herbs (50%), followed by shrubs (19.05%), trees (16.67%), bush (9.52%) and grass (4.76%). The biological growth of weeds was dominant for the invasive plant species, followed by trees in the introduced species, and shrubs and trees in the introduced and invasive species. These indicate that the annual species and invasive weeds are better adapted to the environmental conditions in the studied areas in KSA.

AB Chirocephalus marchesonii is a fairy shrimp endemic to the Pilato Lake, a small temporary high-elevation lake (1948 m a.s.l.) located in the Central Apennines (Italy). The species is of particular conservation interest, since it has limited thermal tolerance, low dispersal capacity and is represented by a single population with a very restricted range. The anthropogenic pressure linked to summer tourism and the habitat's vulnerability to climate change represent the main threats to the species. Concern over the population's persistence has been increased by a period of total drying of the lake in summer 2017, which was attributed to earthquakes that occurred in 2016 and were judged to have altered the hydrogeological conditions. Our study aims were to: i) evaluate the conservation status of C. marchesonii and its habitat; ii) examine the influence of enviromnental parameters on the zooplankton community, with special reference to C. marchesonii population densities; and iii) provide information to underpin effective conservation strategies. The zooplankton community was monitored monthly from July to November 2018 and from June to August 2019, using a Runner bottle and an 80-mu m mesh net within transects of known length. On each sampling occasion, 13 physicochemical parameters were measured, and water-level fluctuations and lake surface area were recorded. Higher air temperatures seem to be a key driver of drying events, whereas we identified no significant differences in water physicochemistry compared to the past. The mean estimated population density of C. marchesonii (0.06 individuals L-1) showed that, despite the 2017 drying event, the species completed its life cycle during the study period, although its population densities were lower than previously recorded. Our results can inform extinction risk assessment and associated management strategies, such as the identification of alternative habitats with the potential to support C. marchesonii populations.

AB Widespread invasive nitrogen-fixing plant species pose major threats to water resources, biodiversity and nutrient dynamics of river catchments around the world. However, the impacts of invasive N-2-fixing plants on in-stream sediment nutrient dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the impacts of invasive N-2-fixing Acacia mearnsii and A. mearnsii clearing on two mountain streams in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. Nutrients were measured in fine sediment that had infiltrated into the gravel bed and surface water in three reaches associated with natural fynbos shrubs, A. mearnsii invaded and cleared riparian ecotones. Results showed that the impacts of A. mearnsii invasions and Acacia clearing in riparian areas on in-stream sediment-associated nutrient concentrations are context-dependent. The difference in channel morphometry and sediment geochemical attributes at reach-scale contributed to the contrasting spatial patterns of sediment-adsorbed nutrients within these rivers. There was also an indication of a long-lasting effect of invasion on total phosphorus that could persist in river sediments >= 10 years after the removal of dense A. mearnsii stands in close proximity to streams. This could be a result of the complexation between phosphorus and immobile iron in sediment, resulting in the retention of 'legacy phosphorus'. This underlines the importance of fine sediments in capturing nutrients and ultimately regulating nutrient concentrations in the water column.

AB Management options to maintain the stability of Drakensberg grasslands need to incorporate their dynamic nature in response to fire. This study addressed the lack of information on the spatial and temporal changes of these grasslands at a small (tuft) scale. The basal area of every tuft in three 0.25 m2 quadrats per replicate (3) of four burning treatments was mapped over two years in a long-term burning trial using a pantograph. The extent of change in size and shape of tufts indicated the dynamic nature of these grasslands from year to year. Basal cover of Themeda triandra was high in the annual winter (62.5%) and biennial spring (50.5%) burns, lower in the five-year burn (36.1%) and low in the biennial summer burn (11.5%). The bare area in the biennial summer burn increased by 5.6%, remained the same in the annual winter, and decreased in the biennial spring (6.1%) and five-year (7.8%) burns. The disappearance of Stiburus alopecuroides from the summer burn and increase in basal cover of Tristachya leucothrix indicates a directional change in composition that is likely to be irreversible. The biennial spring burn, where the three dominant species were in a state of equilibrium, is recommended for stability.

AB Questions: Globally, ecological restoration is required to restore degraded landscapes and to contribute to biodiversity conservation. Ecological theory suggests that manipulating dispersal, abiotic and biotic filters limiting plant re-establishment will improve restoration outcomes. Here, we manipulated spread depth of soil containing a salvaged soil seedbank (dispersal filter), soil compaction (abiotic filter) and herbivore grazing (biotic filter) in a topsoil transfer experiment to test their effects on restoration success.
   Location: Banksia woodland of the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia.
   Methods: Topsoil (upper similar to 7 cm) with its seedbank was removed from a donor site (20 ha) of recently cleared native vegetation and transferred to six recipient restoration sites (16 ha). Deep (10 cm thick) and shallow (5 cm thick) layers of topsoil were applied in a fully factorial experiment, with and without soil ripping and fencing, respectively. We analysed emergence, survival and functional types (alien/native, life form, fire response) of all vascular plant species for two consecutive years after topsoil transfer.
   Results: The most successful restoration treatment was deep topsoil with a mean density of 14.3 m(-2) native perennial germinants in year one and 7.3 m(-2) in year two. Application of deep topsoil increased native seedling emergence by 34% and decreased weed density by 21% compared with shallow topsoil. Overall seedling survival across the two-year period was unaffected by filter treatments (range 0.6%-5%). After two years, the resulting plant community was 6%-38% weed species and of native perennial species, 12%-48% were capable of resprouting.
   Conclusions: Manipulation of the dispersal filter alone, that is deep topsoil application, can lead to near-equivalent native species number emerging on restoration sites as compared to pre-cleared woodland. However, more research is required to test additional restoration tools to improve survival of biodiverse plant communities. For example, targeted herbicide application coupled with soil ripping to improve weed management and native seedling establishment.

AB Competition for shared resources represents a fundamental driver of biological diversity. However, the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution in deep-time has been predominantly investigated using trait evolutionary models which assume that lineages evolve independently from each other. Consequently, the role of species interactions in driving macroevolutionary dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify the prevalence for signatures of competition between related species in the evolution of ecomorphological traits across the bird radiation. We find that mechanistic trait models accounting for the effect of species interactions on phenotypic divergence provide the best fit for the data on at least one trait axis in 27 out of 59 clades ranging between 21 and 195 species. Where it occurs, the signature of competition generally coincides with positive species diversity-dependence, driven by the accumulation of lineages with similar ecologies, and we find scarce evidence for trait-dependent or negative diversity-dependent phenotypic evolution. Overall, our results suggest that the footprint of interspecific competition is often eroded in long-term patterns of phenotypic diversification, and that other selection pressures may predominantly shape ecomorphological diversity among extant species at macroevolutionary scales.

AB Intensive fishing that selects for large and old individuals can have pervasive effects on traits directly associated with the fecundity and survival of the target species. The observed reduction in fish body size can result in earlier sexual maturity at a smaller body size, leading to a lower individual reproductive output and population productivity in the long term. In addition, increased predation can induce similar responses in age and size at maturity due to the release of intraspecific competition and the lower population density. Thus, the combined impact of fisheries and predation is more difficult to predict due to their competition for fish, ultimately limiting and directing the prey size selectivity of each competitor. This can lead to various responses of fish on individual and population levels, depending on how the impacts of fisheries and predation affect each other. To explore this topic, we used an individual-based model to investigate the responses of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) to the coupled pressures of the prevailing fishing regime and predation by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) as a study system. By simulating the growth trajectories of hake with consideration to its pronounced sexual size dimorphism (SSD), we applied Holling's Type II and III functional responses (FRII and FRIII, respectively) and the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator model to describe prey-predator dynamics. Our results demonstrate how the intensity, duration, and prey sizes selected by predation and fisheries determine the potential for evolutionary changes in hake life-history traits. Additionally, pronounced SSD in hake as well as the predation type play a pivotal role in hake resilience and recovery following a period of overexploitation. Different types of predation reveal the discrepancy in the intensity of competition between predators and fisheries for fish, as well as predator survival, which is relevant for sustainable fisheries management and effective predator conservation strategies.

   resilient landscape; immaterial heritage; Spanish Mediterranean Huertas
AB The Huerta is recognised as one of the 13 specific agricultural landscapes in Europe, present in only three Mediterranean countries, namely Spain, Italy, and Greece. In the case of Spain, three areas fall within the established Huerta agricultural classification: the Huertas de Valencia, Murcia, and Vega Baja. While all of them share common landscape features, each Huerta has distinguishing singularities which are approached through two perspectives: firstly, the structural tangible elements, related to functional networks-water distribution, pathways networks, settlement patterns, and the agricultural production system; and secondly, the role of the intangible components-connotations of the word Huerta, water management, canal and path upkeep rules, and the administration of these territories. The analysis of the tangible elements and intangible components in the three Spanish Huertas shows these territories as complex and balanced systems that have historically counterbalanced the environmental drawbacks in one of the most arid European regions. Despite being a highly appreciated environmental and productive asset, these Huertas are under intense pressure from urban development in highly urbanized metropolitan areas. This study shows Huertas' uniqueness through their historical role in the territorial planning and management strategies at the local level, finally depicting Huertas as a present strategical opportunity for reaching environmental goals in peri-urban areas.

AB Understanding the causes behind species richness and endemicity is fundamental to explain biodiversity and assist conservation management, especially in biodiversity hotspots like the Mediterranean Basin. Here we investigate the patterns in Iberian forest spider communities and the processes behind their assembly, by testing hypotheses about the effects of climate and habitat on species richness, endemicity and structure of communities at different spatial scales, and about how microhabitat and dispersal affect the level of endemicity of species. We studied 16 spider communities in IberianQuercusforests from different climatic zones, applying a standardised sampling protocol. We examined the contribution of habitat, climate, and geography to the differences in the composition of spider communities across spatial scales using distance-based redundancy analysis models (dbRDA) and principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM). We assessed the effects of the same variables on the endemicity of communities (measured by a weighted index), and tested the correlation between the microhabitat and the ballooning frequency (obtained from bibliography), and the endemicity of species through generalised linear models. Spider communities formed two groups-one southern and one northern-based on similarity in species composition. Precipitation and temperature were inversely related with the number of species while geography and forest type explained the compositional similarities between communities at different spatial scales. Endemicity of communities increased with temperature and decreased with precipitation, whereas species endemicity decreased with ballooning frequency. Our findings illustrate how niche-related processes may drive spider diversity while dispersal determines species distribution and identity and, ultimately, community composition. From a conservation viewpoint, when maximising species richness is incompatible with prioritising endemicity, the criteria to follow may depend on the geographic scale at which decisions are made.

AB Human mobility connects urban dwellers and neighborhoods and impacts social equity. An in-depth understanding of human mobility helps to enhance urban resilience. However, limited research has focused on mobility resilience. Building on previous research, this study looks at the neighborhood connectivity enabled by urban mobility. We analyze the aggregated mobility patterns in Boston through the coupling of network structure and social characteristics. Geocoded twitter data combined with socioeconomic datasets were used to create a mobility-based urban network. Through the quantitative analysis, we found that the social segregation in Boston shapes its mobility network. Network communities identified by the Louvain modularity algorithm are often self-containing, meaning that their residents are more likely to move within their communities. A multinomial regression reveals that spatial racial and income segregation has a strong impact on the dynamic segregation of the network. The beneficial network characteristics -e.g. higher density and well-connected motifs- are less present in areas with bolder presence of minorities. Thus, the resilience state is not equitable among neighborhoods of different income levels and races, indicating that the resilience measures of urban networks need to be adapted according to sociodemographic characteristics.

AB Seasonal changes in prevalence rate and number of the epizoic limpet Lottia tenuisculpta on its gastropod hosts, Omphalius nigerrimus and Reishia clavigera, were investigated in Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Monthly samplings conducted from September 2013 to September 2014 revealed that L. tenuisculpta disappeared from the host in winter and new recruits appeared in early spring. Limpets remained on their host up to a critical shell length of 7 mm on O. nigerrimus and 5 mm on R. clavigera. Capture-recapture method confirmed limpets reaching these sizes migrate onto rock surfaces. Additionally, the effects of the host sizes on their epizoic limpets were examined using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model showed that limpet shell length decreased with the increasing number of conspecifics on both host species. The shell width of O. nigerrimus had a slightly negative effect on the shell length of limpets, whereas that of R. clavigera had a positive effect on it. Our study revealed the host utilization of epizoic limpets changed seasonally and differed between host species. We suggest that both physical and biological factors of hosts affect the growth, survival, and attachment of the epizoites.

AB The historic influence of human fire and the role of 'top-down' vs 'bottom-up' drivers on ecosystems globally is highly contested, and our knowledge of regime diversity is poor. This paper uses an early European account as a case study to describe Aboriginal fire history in south-eastern Australia based on links between fire and: grasslands, native foods and culture. The route and observations detailed in Assistant Protector William Thomas' 1840 account of a journey led by Aborigines to Western Port, Victoria, were overlayed with grass-tree boundaries compiled from historic plans. The narrative provides direct evidence of up to moderate-scale and intensity burns (with minimal fine-scale patchiness), undertaken in the height of the dry season, opportunistically linked to rainfall. The fires targeted open grassy 'plains' to maintain and access preferred hunter-gathering grounds. A synthesis of the earliest records supports high frequency anthropogenic burning maintaining alternative vegetation states with dynamic boundaries on elevated alluvial plains and, in places, adjoining swamps. The narrative represents an important primary source for studying traditional society, including the description of a local historic fire regime ('koyuga burning'). Establishing such a fire regime 'benchmark' has the potential to stimulate new interdisciplinary research around the complex processes controlling grass-tree patterns, and build confidence that fire-stick farming was potentially instrumental in grassland formation, and integral to grassland maintenance throughout this region.

AB Habitat degradation and land-use change severely threaten the survival of fairy shrimp and the vernal pools in which they live. Limiting effective fairy shrimp conservation management efforts is the ability to readily identify species without the capture and sacrifice of individuals for microscopy. Here we demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding is an effective non-invasive tool for monitoring fairy shrimp. Results from ten Southern California vernal pools comparing eDNA and traditional dip-net methods showed that eDNA metabarcoding with16SrDNA provides exceptional species-level resolution. Importantly, while the two methods were concordant during early hydroperiods where adults were present, eDNA detected fairy shrimp for up to 2 months after dip-nets failed to detect any adults, expanding the time period for vernal pool monitoring. Together, these results provide resource managers a simple, cost-effective, and non-invasive method for biomonitoring endangered fairy shrimp species.

AB The impact of historical and present drivers on biodiversity, particularly species richness and abundance, in afforestation areas concerning non-native tree species is still poorly understood. A better understanding is important to ensure appropriate forest management in the face of climate change and increasing demand for wood products. Here, we have reviewed 75 biodiversity studies in Sitka spruce plantations in NW Europe, forest management recommendations for maintaining biodiversity, timber production and carbon sequestration in Sitka spruce forests in coastal Norway compared to NW Europe. Due to more focus on non-market landscape benefits and protection sites in coastal areas, transformation of spruce plantations is common. Premature cutting of stands and shelterbelts and clearing away saplings has become the dominant management practice in Norway. Based on the extent of use in Norway, and results from biodiversity studies in Sitka spruce plantations in NW Europe, the quality of evidence for the prevailing practice and recommendations in coastal Norway is highly questioned. To reduce conflicts, we propose a more knowledge-based management, a broader perspective underpinning the range of afforestation goals, also including the use of alternative silvicultural methods to increase structural variation in Sitka spruce stands.

TI Guano morphology has the potential to inform conservation strategies in

AB Bats are primary consumers of nocturnal insects, disperse nutrients across landscapes, and are excellent bioindicators of an ecosystem's health, however four of the seventeen Great British species are listed as declining. In this study we aim to investigate the link between bat guano morphology and diet, specifically looking at the ability to predict 1) species, 2) dietary guild, and 3) bat size, using guano morphology alone. Guano from 16 bat species sampled from across Great Britain were analysed to determine various morphological metrics. These data were coupled with diet data obtained by an extensive literature review. It was found that guano morphology overlapped too much to make predictions on the species of bat which deposited the guano, however, in some cases, it could be used to indicate the dietary guild to which the bat belonged. In general, guano morphology seems more correlated to diet than species. This enables the identification of the most important prey taxa within a local environment; a crucial step for informing conservation strategies.

TI Droughts Decouple African Savanna Grazers from Their Preferred Forage

AB Grazing lawn and flammable-tussock grass communities are contrasting resource pools for mammalian grazers in terms of forage quantity and quality. Drought events fundamentally alter forage availability within these communities and therefore should alter herbivore use with repercussions for the recovery and functioning of ecosystems after drought. During and after an intense El Nino drought (2014-2017) in Kruger National Park, South Africa, we addressed two questions: (1) how does herbivore use of different grass types change during a drought and (2) how do these changes affect grass productivity post-drought? We monitored grazer use of three different grass communities (lawn, tussock and burned-tussock) at a landscape scale and measured primary productivity monthly during and post-drought. For the first drought year, grazer numbers were highest on grazing lawn communities. This pattern continued into the second dry growing season, until herbivores finally left the study area. Both lawns and tussock grasslands recovered rapidly after the first good rainfall (productivity > 150 g m(-2) per month). However, grazers did not return to feed on the same patches they had frequented pre-drought resulting in grazing lawn grasses self-shading and senescing. Longer droughts have the potential to decouple grazers and grazing lawns with negative impacts on lawn productivity and persistence that could drive the loss of lawns in savanna landscapes and impact mesoherbivore populations. It is clear from our results that grazer effects need to be incorporated into drought frameworks to understand the consequences of droughts for grassland function.

AB Seasonally dry woodlands are the dominant land cover across southern Africa. They are biodiverse, structurally complex, and important for ecosystem service provision. Species composition and structure vary across the region producing a diverse array of woodland types. The woodlands of the Huila plateau in southwest Angola represent the extreme southwestern extent of the miombo ecoregion and are markedly drier than other woodlands within this ecoregion. They remain understudied, however, compared to woodlands further east in the miombo ecoregion. We aimed to elucidate further the tree diversity found within southwestern Angolan woodlands by conducting a plot-based study in Bicuar National Park, comparing tree species composition and woodland structure with similar plots in Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We found Bicuar National Park had comparatively low tree species diversity, but contained 27 tree species not found in other plots. Plots in Bicuar had low basal area, excepting plots dominated by Baikiaea plurijuga. In a comparison of plots in intact vegetation with areas previously disturbed by shifting-cultivation agriculture, we found species diversity was marginally higher in disturbed plots. Bicuar National Park remains an important woodland refuge in Angola, with an uncommon mosaic of woodland types within a small area. While we highlight wide variation in species composition and woodland structure across the miombo ecoregion, plot-based studies with more dense sampling across the ecoregion are clearly needed to more broadly understand regional variation in vegetation diversity, composition and structure.

AB This study attempts to understand how invasive legumes such as Acacia saligna may compete with indigenous legumes such as Virgilia divaricata. The two species are trees with similar growth forms. We studied the competitive ability of invasive and indigenous seedlings under variations in soil phosphorus availability. South African fynbos vegetation is threatened by invasive Acacia. The indigenous tree legume, Virgilia, grows in similar phosphorus soil conditions as Acacia although there is a gap in the knowledge of their physiology. We investigated the utilization of different inorganic P sources by the invasive A. saligna and the native V. divaricata in the presence and absence of root nodules in each species. Plant performance in terms of photosynthesis and biomass production was also analysed. Plants were cultivated in silica sand supplied with Long Ashton nutrient solution, modified to contain either 50 mu M P or 500 mu M P applied as NaH2PO4 center dot 2H(2)O. Rate of growth was estimated as the increase in mass in plants harvested after 4 and 8 weeks of growth. After 4 weeks of growth, the seedlings of Virgilia grew quicker and produced more biomass than Acacia, under both phosphorus conditions. However, this was reversed after 8 weeks of growth, with Acacia out-competing Virgilia. Increased growth of the invasive legumes was achieved by relying on soil nitrogen under high phosphorus conditions and shifting to atmospheric sources under lower phosphorus levels. The strategies of altering photosynthetic carbon balance and nitrogen acquisition under varying soil phosphorus conditions potentially underpin the invasive potential of Acacia in fynbos soils.

AB Body size is fundamental to the physiology and ecology of organisms. Crocodyliforms are no exception, and several methods have been developed to estimate their absolute body sizes from bone measurements. However, speciesspecific sizes, such as sexually mature sizes and the maximum sizes were not taken into account due to the challenging maturity assessment of osteological specimens. Here, we provide a vertebrae-based method to estimate absolute and species-specific body lengths in crocodylians. Lengths of cervical to anterior caudal centra were measured and relations between the body lengths (snout-vent and total lengths [TLs]) and lengths of either a single centrum or a series of centra were modeled for extant species. Additionally, states of neurocentral (NC) suture closure were recorded for the maturity assessment. Comparisons of TLs and timings of NC suture closure showed that most extant crocodylians reach sexual maturity before closure of precaudal NC sutures. Centrum lengths (CLs) of the smallest individuals with closed precaudal NC sutures within species were correlated with the species maximum TLs in extant taxa; therefore, the upper or lower limit of the species maximum sizes can be determined from CLs and states of NC suture closure. The application of the current method to noncrocodylian crocodyliforms requires similar numbers of precaudal vertebrae, body proportions, and timings of NC suture closure as compared to extant crocodylians.

AB The Human System is within the Earth System. They should be modeled bidirectionally coupled, as they are in reality. The Human System is rapidly expanding, mostly due to consumption of fossil fuels (approximately one million times faster than Nature accumulated them) and fossil water. This threatens not only other planetary subsystems but also the Human System itself. Carrying Capacity is an important tool to measure sustainability, but there is a widespread view that Carrying Capacity is not applicable to humans. Carrying Capacity has generally been prescribed a priori, mostly using the logistic equation. However, the real dynamics of human population and consumption are not represented by this equation or its variants. We argue that Carrying Capacity should not be prescribed but should instead be dynamically derived a posteriori from the bidirectional coupling of Earth System submodels with the Human System model. We demonstrate this approach with a minimal model of Human-Nature interaction (HANDY).
   The Human System is a subsystem of the Earth System, with inputs (resources) from Earth System sources and outputs (waste, emissions) to Earth System sinks.
   The Human System is growing rapidly due to nonrenewable stocks of fossil fuels and water and threatens the sustainability of the Human System and to overwhelm the Earth System.
   Carrying Capacity has been prescribed a priori and using the logistic equation, which does not represent the dynamics of the Human System.
   Our new approach to human Carrying Capacity is derived from dynamically coupled Earth System-Human System models and can be used to estimate the sustainability of the Human System.

AB Ecological restoration of closed landfill sites is often challenging due to poor soil structure and seed bank. Currently, the planting mixes used in closed landfills in Hong Kong involved mainly exotic trees with only a small proportion of native trees and shrubs. In this study, we investigated the vegetation regeneration in seven closed landfill sites in Hong Kong. Our Generalised Linear Mixed Models suggested that native plant regeneration, species diversity and evenness were positively influenced by restoration age as well as density and diversity of native species planted. Commonly planted exotic tree species were shown to persist which explained the poorer native regeneration. It is recommended to improve the planting mixes by increasing the proportion of native species. Despite the merit provided by exotic legumes for ecosystem services (e.g. nitrogen fixation), removal of exotic species in the existing plantations is considered necessary to release resources for natural regeneration.

AB Omnivory is widespread in food webs, with an important stabilising effect. The strength of omnivorous trophic interactions may change considerably with changes in the local environment. Shallow temporary waters are often characterised by high levels of inorganic turbidity that may directly limit the food uptake of filter-feeding organisms, but there is little evidence on how it might affect omnivorous species. Anostracans are key species of temporary waters and recent evidence suggests that these organisms are omnivorous consumers of both phyto- and zooplankton. Using Branchinecta orientalis as a model species, our aim was to test how turbidity affects the feeding of an omnivorous anostracan. To do this, we used short-term feeding experiments and stable isotope analyses, with animals collected from soda pans in eastern Austria. In the feeding experiments, algae and zooplankton were offered as food either separately or in combination. The prey type treatments were crossed with turbidity levels in a factorial design. There was a pronounced decrease in the ingested algal biomass with increasing turbidity. Conversely, ingestion rates on zooplankton were less affected by turbidity. Stable isotope analyses from field material supported our experimental results by showing a positive relationship of the trophic position of anostracans and the trophic niche of the communities with turbidity. Our results show that turbidity modulates the intraguild trophic relationship between anostracans and their prey by shifting the diet of anostracans from more herbivorous in transparent to more carnivorous in turbid waters. Thus, inorganic turbidity might also have a community-shaping role in plankton communities of temporary waters through altering trophic relationships.

AB Categorical raster datasets often require upscaling to a lower spatial resolution to make them compatible with the scale of ecological analysis. When aggregating categorical data, two critical issues arise: (a) ignoring compositional information present in the high-resolution grid cells leads to high and uncontrolled loss of information in the scaled dataset; and (b) restricting classes to those present in the high-resolution dataset assumes validity of the classification scheme at the lower, aggregated resolution. I introduce a new scaling algorithm that aggregates categorical data while simultaneously controlling for information loss by generating a non-hierarchical, representative, classification system for the aggregated scale. The Multi-Dimensional Grid-Point (MDGP) scaling algorithm acknowledges the statistical constraints of compositional count data. In a neutral-landscape simulation study implementing a full-factorial design for landscape characteristics, scale factors and algorithm parameters, I evaluated consistency and sensitivity of the scaling algorithm. Consistency and sensitivity were assessed for compositional information retention (IRcmp) and class-label fidelity (CLF, the probability of recurring scaled class labels) for neutral random landscapes with the same properties. The MDGP-scaling algorithm consistently preserved information at a significantly higher rate than other commonly used algorithms. Consistency of the algorithm was high for IRcmp and CLF, but coefficients of variation of both metrics across landscapes varied most with class-abundance distribution. A diminishing return for IRcmp was observed with increasing class-label precision. Mean class-label recurrence probability was consistently above 75% for all simulated landscape types, scale factors and class-label precisions. The MDGP-scaling algorithm is the first algorithm that generates data-driven, scale-specific classification schemes while conducting spatial data aggregation. Consistent gain in IRcmp and the associated reproducibility of classification systems strongly suggest that the increased precision of scaled maps will improve ecological models that rely on upscaling of high-resolution categorical raster data.

AB The shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.) is a major parkland species occurring across Africa from East to West. Its fruits, butter, and further products from shea butter play key roles in the Sustainable Development Goals of poverty eradication, hunger elimination, and gender equity in many African regions. The inter-play of abiotic conditions (e.g. rainfall patterns, drought periods) and biotic interactions (grazing by large herbivores) shape parklands because they influence vital processes like photosynthesis, transpiration and biomass production of common plant species including shea. We measured gas exchange of shea seedlings grown under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)), with and without competition of the C4 grass Cenchrus pedicellatus, and under different water availabilities in greenhouse chambers. We hypothesized that eCO(2) will generally increase seedling growth in shea via increases in photosynthesis. When growing together with C4 grass at low water availability, we expect an improved competitiveness of shea under eCO(2), beacuse eCO(2) is reported to augment water use efficiency (WUEi) of C3 plants more than C4 plants. Increased CO2 caused a 10% (p < 0.001) increase in maximum light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax), 22% (p < 0.001) increase in WUEi and 13% (p < 0.001) increase in stem mass fraction (SMF) of shea. Grass competition significantly reduced Amax by 9% (p < 0.001), SMF (p < 0.001) by 19%, with a corresponding reduction in all biomass parameters, but also significantly increased the C/N ratio (by 3%, p < 0.001). Interactive effects of eCO(2) and competition were recorded for maximum electron transport rate, dark respiration, stomatal conductance, CO2 compensation point and the leaf area ratio. The control of grasses in the early stages of shea development is therefore recommended.

AB Questions Perennial tussock grasses represent the principal fuel source for savanna fires; however, basic information about the impact of fire on their demography remains scarce. Do dominant perennial grass species differ in their demographic parameters? What is the overall impact of tussock circumference and fire regimes on grass demographic parameters? Do grass species differ in the sensitivity of their demographic parameters to fire regimes and tussock circumference? Location The study site is located in the savanna of the Lamto reserve, in the center of Ivory Coast (6 degrees 9 ' to 6 degrees 18 ' N, 5 degrees 15 ' to 4 degrees 57 ' E). Methods Data on the nine dominant species of tussock grasses were sampled over one year under four fire treatments (early fire, mid-season fire, late fire and no fire). We studied the impact of these fire treatments and tussock circumference on five demographic parameters: mortality, fragmentation (the division of a tussock into several smaller ones), growth, retrogression (the decrease in tussock size) and fecundity. Results All demographic parameters varied among species and across the fire regimes. Late fire had the largest negative effect on all parameters except fecundity. Schizachyrium platyphyllum was the most disadvantaged species by fire in terms of mortality, retrogression and growth, whilst Andropogon ascinodis was the most prone to fragmentation. Hyparrhenia smithiana and Sorghastrum bipennatum produced the most seeds and Brachiaria brachylopha produced the most new tussocks. The circumference of perennial grasses impacted all demographic parameters. Small individuals had the highest mortality and growth rates, while large individuals showed the highest fragmentation and retrogression rates, and produced the most seeds. Conclusions This study showed that perennial grass species differed in their sensitivity to fire treatments. Nevertheless, the mid-season fire could be advised to managers for the sustainable management of the Lamto savanna.

AB The functioning of many ecosystems is highly dependent on their faunal communities, dominated by brachyuran crabs. Key to the maintenance of crab populations are the factors that influence their recruitment into the system, particularly the settlement of their megalopae. While spawning is normally highly synchronised, settlement is often not, implying temporal disruption between spawning and settlement. We examined the roles of several key factors (vegetation type, day/night cycle, and lunar phase) on settlement, testing for generality by working in mangroves at 2 sites in Kenya and South Africa. At each site, larval settlement was quantified using artificial collectors placed in 2 vegetation zones for 12 h periods throughout the part of the neap-spring tidal cycle when tide was sufficient to cover the collectors. This continued for 6 mo in Kenya and 11 mo in South Africa, giving the first long-term settlement dataset for east African mangroves. Moon phase proved to have a major role in megalopal settlement, which demonstrated a high degree of spatial specificity. Settlement was correlated across species with tidal amplitude on both short (monthly) and long time scales and focussed on the vegetation zones occupied by conspecific adults. As the distribution of mangrove species is tightly related to local hydrology, this implies a feedback situation with the conservation of mangroves requiring the maintenance of patterns of water flow within the system to support both the vegetation and the associated fauna.
