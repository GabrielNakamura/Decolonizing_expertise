AB We embraced the learning from nature and back to nature paradigm to develop viable agroforestry scenarios through studying species association in 12 wild yellowhorn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium: a Chinese endemic oil woody plants) communities. We identified 18 species combinations for their suitability as agroforestry mixes where positive associations were detected and thus economic benefits are anticipated. In each wild yellowhorn community, we use nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination to assess community structure and composition, and the climatic variables that most likely influenced existing species distributions. Next, pairwise and multiple species associations were evaluated using several multiple species association indices (e.g., chi(2), Jaccard, Ochiai, Dice). Generally, all species association indices were in agreement and were helpful in identifying several high valued medicinal species that showed positive and significant associations with yellowhorn. Finally, we proposed several agroforestry species mixes suitable for yellowhorn.

AB The population genetic studies of marine fishes usually show complex patterns of genetic differentiation which were influenced by both historical process and contemporary gene flow. Genetic structure of eight different populations for eastern keelback mullet, Liza affinis, collected from the coast along eastern and southern China, was examined using six microsatellite loci. We found strong genetic similarities among most of the samples except the Dongguan population and most microsatellite variation was found within populations. All loci were characterized by high genetic variability with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.871 to 0.928. The Bayesian cluster analysis of the microsatellite data detected four genetic groups with no relation to geographic areas. The bottleneck results also showed no significant values. Based on these data we postulated that complex marine currents and larval dispersal shaped the genetic structured of studied populations. The present study illustrated the importance of understanding the biological significance of genetic differentiation when using molecular data in identifying units for management and protection.

AB Treatments to reduce shrub cover are commonly implemented with the objective of shifting community structure away from shrub dominance and toward shrub and perennial grass codominance. In sagebrush (Artemisia L.) ecosystems, shrub reduction treatments have had variable effects on target shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and non-native annual plants. The factors mediating this variability are not well understood. We used long-term data from Utah's Watershed Restoration Initiative project to assess short-term (1 - 4 yr post-treatment) and long-term (5 -12 yr post-treatment) responses of sagebrush plant communities to five shrub reduction treatments at 94 sites that span a range of abiotic conditions and sagebrush community types. Treatments were pipe harrow with one or two passes, aerator, and fire with and without postfire seeding. We analyzed effect sizes (log of response ratio) to assess responses of sagebrush, perennial and annual grasses and forbs, and ground cover to treatments. Most treatments successfully reduced sagebrush cover over the short and long term. All treatments increased long-term perennial grass cover in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) communities, but in mountain big sagebrush (ssp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) communities, perennial grasses increased only when seeded after fire. In both sagebrush communities, treatments generally resulted in short-term, but not long-term, increases in perennial forb cover. Annual grasses (largely invasive cheatgrass, Bromus tectorum L) increased in all treatments on sites dominated by mountain big sagebrush but stayed constant or decreased on sites dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush. This result was unexpected because sites dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush are typically thought to be less resilient to disturbance and less resistant to invasion than sites dominated by mountain big sagebrush. Together, these results indicate some of the benefits, risks, and contingent outcomes of sagebrush reduction treatments that should be considered carefully in any future decisions about applying such treatments.

AB REDD+ projects primarily focus on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. These projects are regularly evaluated against their core objective of conserving carbon stocks, but their contribution to biodiversity conservation has rarely been assessed. To assess the conservation value of the area and the relative performance of a REDD+ land use plan in Yaeda Valley, a semi-arid savannah ecosystem in northern Tanzania, we implemented an annual wildlife monitoring scheme. Based on direct sightings and indirect signs of wildlife, obtained from stratified walking transects conducted annually from 2015-2018, we estimated annual trends of mammal species richness and wildlife densities in three REDD+ and three non-REDD+ land-use strata. Our surveys document a near complete mammal community in the area. Species accumulation curves, and subsequent statistical comparisons, indicated highest mammal species richness in the woodland habitats (both REDD+ and non REDD+ strata) as compared to more human and livestock impacted areas, and suggested constant species richness from 2015-2018. To estimate stratum- and year-specific livestock and wildlife densities (cattle, donkey, goat and sheep combined, Thomson's gazelle, Kirk's dik-dik) and wildlife sign densities (aardvark, bushbuck, bushpig, Kirk's dik dik, eland, elephant, Maasai giraffe, greater kudu, hyena, impala, lesser kudu, warthog, wildebeest, Plains zebra), we fitted species-specific detection functions in a distance sampling framework. Species-specific densities varied between 2015 and 2018 and showed substantial increases and occasional declines in other species-stratum combinations. However, population growth rates were not systematically associated with specific land-use strata. Although our results do not explicitly provide evidence that REDD+ land-use plans directly co-benefit wildlife conservation, they show that REDD+ areas have the potential to maintain intact wildlife assemblages. To ensure effective long-term conservation outcomes, we advocate for a more formal integration of wildlife conservation goals in the REDD+ scheme.

AB In developing countries, governments often lack the authority and resources to implement conservation outside of protected areas. In such situations, the integration of conservation with local livelihoods is crucial to species recovery and reintroduction efforts. The hirola Beatragus hunteri is the world's most endangered antelope, with a population of <500 individuals that is restricted to <5% of its historical geographic range on the Kenya-Somali border. Long-term hirola declines have been attributed to a combination of disease and rangeland degradation. Tree encroachment-driven by some combination of extirpation of elephants, overgrazing by livestock, and perhaps fire suppression-is at least partly responsible for habitat loss and the decline of contemporary populations. Through interviews in local communities across the hirola's current range, we identified socially acceptable strategies for habitat restoration and hirola recovery. We used classification and regression trees, conditional inference trees, and generalized linear models to identify sociodemographic predictors of support for range-restoration strategies. Locals supported efforts to conserve elephants (which kill trees and thus facilitate grass growth), seed and fertilize grass, and remove trees, but were opposed to livestock reduction. Locals were ambivalent toward controlled burns and soil ripping (a practice through which soil is broken up to prevent compaction). Livestock ownership and years of residency were key predictors of locals' perceptions toward rangeland-restoration practices. Locals owning few livestock were more supportive of elephant conservation, and seeding and fertilization of grass, while longer term residents were more supportive of livestock reduction but were less supportive of elephant conservation. Ultimately, wildlife conservation outside protected areas requires long-term, community-based efforts that are compatible with human livelihoods. We recommend elephant conservation, grass seeding and fertilization, manual tree removal and resting range from livestock both to enhance the potential for hirola recovery and to build positive rapport with local communities in the geographic range of this critically endangered species.

AB Wildlife monitoring is essential for assessing the size of species of conservation or management concern. Wildlife monitoring could be undertaken by selected volunteers when limited resources are available. Here, we study the sources of variation in the detectability of red fox scats and to improve the monitoring of the species by means of volunteers who were briefly trained. We selected nine transects to experimentally evaluate the differences in red fox scat detectability between observers, microsite, and scat abundance. Scats were deposited in five microsites, where we simulate low, medium, and high fox scat abundance. We tested the proposed effects by using GLMM analysis incorporating observer effect as a random factor. Our results indicated effects on scat detectability of observer identity and microsite type. We did not observe the effects of scat abundance on detectability of scats. Detectability was lower for scats located in the middle of the transect and on the rocks. We conclude that large-scale red foxes surveys might be conducted using volunteers, but due to the moderate differences detected among observers should be minimized using a training period.

AB Estuary food webs support many fishes whose habitat preferences and population dynamics may be controlled by prey abundance and distribution. Yet the identity and dynamics of important estuarine prey of many species are either unknown or highly variable between regions. As anthropogenic development in estuaries increases, so does the need to understand how these environments may be supporting economically, culturally, and ecologically important fishes. Here, we examine how important estuary fishes integrate their prey across the seascape and what may influence prey dynamics. Specifically, we surveyed juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka, Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, and surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus diets along with zooplankton abundance in the estuary of the Skeena River (British Columbia, Canada) at a relatively fine scale. We found diets were highly variable, even within a species, but 1 or 2 prey composed most diet contents per species. Juvenile coho salmon primarily consumed terrestrial insects and larval fish, whereas sockeye salmon primarily consumed harpacticoid copepods. In contrast, small pelagic fish (Pacific herring and surf smelt) primarily consumed calanoid copepods, which were the most abundant prey in the environment. We found that certain prey groups were correlated with biophysical factors. For example, calanoid copepod abundance was positively correlated with salinity, whereas harpacticoid copepod abundance was highest over eelgrass sites. Identifying key prey species and how they distribute within the estuary seascape is an integral link in understanding the food-web foundation of fish habitat use in areas under pressure from anthropogenic development.

AB Studies of biodiversity along environmental gradients provide information on how ecological communities change in response to biotic and abiotic factors. For instance, distance to water is associated with several factors that shape the structure and the functioning of ecosystems at a range of spatial scales. We investigated the influence of distance to a perennial water source on ant communities in a semi-arid savanna in northern Botswana. Ant abundance, taxonomic richness, and both alpha and beta diversity were generally higher during the wet than the dry season. However, there were strong seasonal influences on the effects of distance to water, with more pronounced effects during the wet season. While both abundance and beta diversity declined with increasing distances to water during the wet season, there was a contrasting increase in alpha diversity. There was no major effect of distance to water on taxonomic richness during either season. Beta diversity was as high across as along gradients, and we found support for modular rather than nested community structures along gradients. Our study demonstrated that small-scale gradients in distance to water can influence several aspects of ant communities in semi-arid savannas. However, our results also point to strong effects of small-scale environmental variation, for instance associated with vegetation characteristics, soil properties, and plant community structure that are not directly linked to water access.

AB Anostracans (Branchiopoda, Anostraca) have some of the most elaborate mating behaviours among crustaceans. Behaviour of adult anostracans was observed and quantified in 1) receptive males and females, 2) unreceptive females, and 3) isolated individuals of both sexes of Branchinecta lindahliPackard, 1883. Males demonstrated specific mate-searching behaviours, cruising in the lower water column around salient objects. Receptive females hovered around the same objects high in the water column, allowing males to approach from below. Unreceptive females as well as males never exposed to females tended to stay low in the water column and moved around little. Males entirely isolated from females immediately began searching behaviours when water from female cultures was added, demonstrating the presence of pheromones.

AB Socio-spatial planning forums are shedding light on how people embrace, contest or reject social changes. These understandings are now being used to explore sense of place and social sustainability approaches in spatial studies, and provide input into the formulation of socio-spatial planning interventions. Research evidence, however, suggests that the integration of elements from each approach into a unified working model can help overcome existing conceptual confusions and revitalise socio-spatial planning processes. Our research therefore seeks to identify these confusions, as well as the supplementary elements in each approach, resulting in the creation of a conceptual framework that reimages socio-spatial planning. We argue that there are elements conceptually linked in each approach that could be re-conceptualised into a more robust framework for socio-spatial planning. The article further proposes that the synthesis will not only negate the shortcomings inherent in each approach but will also provide a more responsive medium for the current dynamic societal context of socio-spatial planning. Our findings advance socio-spatial planning theory and contribute to a foundation for the future research aimed at improving the understanding of background theories.

AB The present study aimed to reveal the eukaryotic diets of two economically important marine sediment-inhabiting worms, Sipunculus nudus (peanut worm) and Urechis unicinctus (spoon worm), using clone libraries and phylogenetic analyses of 18S rRNA genes. Fungal rDNA was also targeted and analyzed to reveal mycobiomes. Overall, we detected a wide range of eukaryotic phylotypes associated with the larvae of S. nudus and in the gut contents of both worms. These phylotypes included ciliates, diatoms, dinoflagellates, eustigmatophytes, placidids, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes, flatworms, seaweeds, and higher plants. Oomycetes were associated with the planktonic larvae of S. nudus. The composition of eukaryotic diets shifted greatly across the larval, juvenile, and adult stages of S. nudus, and among different gut sections in U unicinctus, reflecting lifestyle changes during the ontogeny of the peanut worm and progressive digestion in the spoon worm. Malassezia-like fungi were prevalent in mycobiomes. Epicoccum and Trichosporon-related phylotypes dominated mycobiomes associated with larval individuals and in the gut contents of adults, respectively. The gut mycobiome of S. nudus was successively characterized through the midgut, aspiratory intestines, hindgut, and rectum as having a high proportion of Climacodon-Rhizochaete, Ceriporiopsis, Cladosporium-Pseudomicrostroma, and Afalassezia-related species in the libraries. These results emphasize the dynamics of diets and gut mycobiomes in marine benthic animals.

AB Obligate out-breeding plants are considered relatively disadvantageous comparing with self-breeding plants when colonizing oceanic islets following long-distance dispersal owing to mate and pollinator limitation. The rarity of heterostyly, a typical out-breeding system, on oceanic islands seems a good proof. However, a heterostylous plant, Guettarda speciosa, is widely distributed on most tropical oceanic islets. Our research demonstrates that its heteromorphic self-incompatibility, plus herkogamy and long flower tube make it rely on pollinator for sexual reproduction, which is generally considered "disadvantageous" for island colonization. We hypothesize that available pollination niche will be a key factor for its colonization on islands. Our studies on remote coral islands show that G. speciosa has built equilibrium population with a 1:1 morph ratio. It could obtain pollination niche from the hawkmoth Agrius convolvuli. A pioneer island plant Ipomoea pes-caprae sustain the pollination niche by providing trophic resource for the larvae of the pollinator. Geographic pattern drawn by Ecological Niche Modelling further indicates the interaction between G. speciosa, A. convolvuli and I. pes-caprae can be bounded on those remote oceanic islands, explaining the colonization of G. speciosa distylous population. These findings demonstrated obligate out-breeding system could be maintained to acclimatize long distance dispersal, if the pollination niche is available.

AB The trophic preferences and ontogenic variations were evaluated and compared between five species of mojarras collected bimonthly for two years (2004-2005) in the hyperhaline lagoon system of Ria Lagartos, Yucatan Peninsula. A total of 361 specimens corresponding to Eucinostomus argenteus, Eucinostomus gula, Eucinostomus harengulus, Eugerres plumieri and Diapterus auratus were collected and used for trophic analysis. The trophic components were analyzed using the Relative Importance Index (RII) and multivariate analysis. The mojarras were defined as second-order consumers, feeding on microcrustaceans (amphipods, copepods, tanaidaceous, ostracods) and significant amounts of detritus with variations in the proportion and frequency of different types of food according to their ontogeny and food availability. Three species shared the same resources. However, differences were observed at the general and ontogenetic level, avoiding inter and intraspecific competition. Results provide evidence of the importance of these coastal habitats for the trophic requirements of marine-euryhaline juvenile fish species.

AB Drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics involve a combination of edaphic, human, and climatic factors that influence and determine SOC distribution across the landscape. High-resolution maps of key indicators of ecosystem health can enable assessments of these drivers and aid in critical management decisions. This study used a systematic field-based approach coupled with statistical modeling and remote sensing to develop accurate, high-resolution maps of key indicators of ecosystem health across savanna ecosystems in South Africa. Two 100-km(2) landscapes in Bushbuckridge Local Municipality were surveyed, and 320 composite topsoil samples were collected. Mid-infrared spectroscopy was used to predict soil properties, with good performance for all models and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) values of 1.3, 0.2, 5, and 3.6 for SOC, pH, sand, and clay, respectively. Validation results for the mapping of soil erosion prevalence and herbaceous cover using RapidEye imagery at 5-m spatial resolution showed good model performance with area under the curve values of 0.80 and 0.86, respectively. The overall (out-of-bag) random forest model performance for mapping of soil properties, reported using R-2, was 0.8, 0.77, and 0.82 for SOC, pH, and sand, respectively. Calibration model performance was good, with RMSEP values of 2.6 g kg(-1) for SOC, 0.2 for pH, and 6% for sand content. Strong gradients of increasing SOC and pH corresponded with decreasing sand content between the study sites. Although both sites had low SOC overall, important driving factors of SOC dynamics included soil texture, soil erosion prevalence, and climate. These data will inform strategic land management decisions focused particularly on improving ecosystem conditions.

AB The characteristic vegetation structure of arid savannas with a dominant layer of perennial grass is maintained by the putative competitive superiority of the C-4 grasses. When this competitive balance is disturbed by weakening the grasses or favoring the recruitment of other species, trees, shrubs, single grass, or forb species can increase and initiate sudden dominance shifts. Such shifts involving woody species, often termed shrub encroachment, or the mass spreading of so-called increaser species have been extensively researched, but studies on similar processes without obvious preceding disturbance are rare. In Namibia, the native herbaceous legume Crotalaria podocarpa has recently encroached parts of the escarpment region, seriously affecting the productivity of local fodder grasses. Here, we studied the interaction between seedlings of the legume and the dominant local fodder grass (Stipagrostis ciliata). We used a pot experiment to test seedling survival and to investigate the growth of Crotalaria in competition with Stipagrostis. Additional field observations were conducted to quantify the interactive effect. We found germination and growth of the legume seedlings to be facilitated by inactive (dead or dormant) grass tussocks and unhindered by active ones. Seedling survival was three times higher in inactive tussocks and Crotalaria grew taller. In the field, high densities of the legume had a clear negative effect on productivity of the grass. The C-4 grass was unable to limit the recruitment and spread of the legume, and Crotalaria did outcompete the putative more competitive grass. Hence, the legume is able to spread and establish itself in large numbers and initiate a dominance shift in savannas, similar to shrub encroachment.

AB The gastric armature of decapod foregut is a feeding structure that sparks controversial debates about the role dietary and historical components have in shaping its morphological traits. Having previous information about the natural diet is an interesting way to gather evidence on this issue. For the present study, we analyzed the morphological traits of gastric ossicles involved directly in the maceration of food in nine species of freshwater crabs of the family Trichodactylidae (Brachyura: Decapoda) representing five genera, three tribes and two subfamilies. The analyzed gastric ossicles were quite consistent among closely related species, suggesting that the observed traits had a clear phylogenetic component. However, it was also noted that the morphological traits of the gastric teeth of trichodactylid crabs match well with the natural diet and presented likeness with general features of other species with a similar trophic habit. We discuss the influence of phylogeny and function on the design of morphological traits and propose to quantify the role of phylogeny and function in shaping morphological traits through the analysis of phylogenetic signals.

AB Climate change, fire and habitat loss have been linked separately with selected aspect(s) of alien plant invasion. No attempt has also been made to simultaneously understand the linkages that exist among the three issues. There is a need of scientific literature that inter-links the three phenomena simultaneously with all the aspects of alien plant invasion. This would help to develop a comprehensive understanding about the role played by the issues directly and indirectly in magnifying habitat invasion. The present review is the first attempt to reveal in detail the complex environmental and ecological processes that synergistically link the issues with one-another and alien plant invasion. Scores were also assigned to secondary information and analyzed statistically. The three phenomena were precisely found to increase the problem through direct or indirect effects. While devising mitigation measures, such inter-linkages must be taken into account so that alien plant species could be managed efficiently.

AB This study aimed to assess the diel changes of ichthyoplankton occurrence, during a known recruitment period, to a wind-dominated coastal lagoon (Argentina). We collected plankton samples at three sites of the lagoon's inlet area every 3 h during four 24 h cycles in mid austral summer. For each early-life history stage (eggs, yolk sac, preflexion larvae, postflexion larvae and early juveniles), the relationship between the abundance and possible combinations of the time of sampling, the wind effect, the wave period and the tidal state was evaluated by fitting generalized linear mix-effects models (GLMM). The wind effects depending on the time of sampling mainly affected fish abundance in all developmental stages. Overall, the highest abundances were collected at nocturnal hours when low-speed offshore winds blew. In addition, higher abundances of eggs, yolk sac and preflexion larvae were related to the incoming flood tide; whereas higher abundances of postflexion larvae and early juveniles were related to longer wave periods. We argued that the daily variation in the abundance of early-life history stages of fishes is related to the sea-land breeze cycle. Therefore, a conceptual framework of the recruitment process of eggs, larvae and early juveniles of fishes into this estuarine system considering the daily effect of winds is proposed.

AB Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species' distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore's response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.

   Methods: The plots were recorded from a range of river types from upland streams to wadeable lowland rivers. A total of 1,613 plots were classified using supervised K-means clustering through the programme JUICE. The Phi co-efficient for presence/absence data was used to measure fidelity of the vegetation communities.
   Results: The vegetation communities could be initially sub-divided in to four main categories: (1) bryophyte-dominated aquatic vegetation, (2) bryophyte-dominated marginal vegetation, (3) vascular plant-dominated aquatic vegetation and (4) vascular plant-dominated marginal/emergent vegetation. Within these four categories the vegetation was classified into seven classes, 18 alliances and 30 associations. Descriptions are given for each including variants and sub-associations if found at association level.
   Conclusions: There is a rich diversity of bryophyte communities within Irish rivers and they are an integral part of the river network, whereas there was less diversity among vascular plant communities. The distinction between some communities was not as sharp as expected for a variety of reasons discussed in this paper, nevertheless, a working classification system was constructed.

AB A study of the distribution, abundance and diet of the critically endangered Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) was undertaken during 2010 and 2011 in the Mesangat wetland, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. It provides the first hard data concerning the ecology of the species outside of mainland Indochina. Crocodiles were captured if possible, weighed, measured and tagged subcutaneously with a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT tag). Forty-three (43) non-hatchling C. siamensis were identified, of which seven were adults. An estimate of total non-hatchling population size was calculated from individuals marked in 2010 and re-captured in 2011, extrapolated to the area of all locations where C. siamensis were seen. The total population size in the survey area was estimated to be approximately 75 individuals. Ninety-one percent (91%) of all C. siamensis detections (n=77) occurred outside the forest-type habitat, adjacent to or within two meters of floating grassy mats. The first investigation on stomach contents of the species was undertaken in this study. Diet samples from 13 C. siamensis were obtained from stomach lavage and analysed individually. Prey found in stomach contents contained insect remnants, snail shells, fish bones, bird feathers, snake scales and small mammal fur and varied considerably between individuals. The presence of necrophagic ants suggested that C. siamensis consume carrion. The current study confirmed at least one healthy breeding population of C. siamensis outside of the mainland of Indochina and provides important data for the species' long-term conservation in Kalimantan.

AB In Argentina, the intensification of soybean production has displaced a substantial proportion of cattle ranching to fluvial wetlands such as those in the Delta of the Parana River. Cattle grazing affects structure and dynamics of native forage plants but there is little information on this impact in populations from fluvial wetlands. This study addresses the effect of cattle ranching on density, survival, mean life-span and aerial biomass of Hymenachne pernambucense (Poaceae), an important forage species in the region. The study was carried out monthly for one year in permanents plots subject to continuous grazing and plots excluded from grazing in the Middle Delta of the Parana River. In plots excluded from grazing, tillers showed significantly higher population density and survival, and a two-fold increase in mean life-span, while continuous grazing decreased survival of cohorts. The largest contribution to tiller density in ungrazed and grazed populations was made by spring and summer cohorts, respectively. Total and green biomass were significantly higher in the ungrazed population, with highest differences in late spring-early summer. Cattle grazing affected the relationship between tiller density and green biomass suggesting that cattle prefer sprouts because they are more palatable and nutritious than older tissue.

AB This paper presents an analysis of spatial and temporal patterns in the fish larvae composition of two geographically adjacent nearshore areas within the Humboldt Current System (HCS), northern Chile. Five surveys were performed at Isla Santa Maria (ISM) and Punta Coloso (COL), Mejillones Peninsula. Ichthyoplankton were collected every 15 days in 2014 during the austral autumn-winter (May to August). A total of 412,410 fish larvae belonging to 36 taxa were identified, a high abundance compared with other HCS regions. Data also revealed similarities in species recorded compared with central Chile as well as differences compared with central Peru; a number of families were shared between these HCS regions and other systems (e. g., Canarias Current System). ISM was dominated by intertidal-subtidal species (e.g., Helcogrammoides cunninghami), while Engraulis ringens was most abundant at COL. Several species were positively correlated with dissolved oxygen (e.g., Auchenionchus microcirrhis), as well as temperature and Ekman transport (e.g., Sebastes oculatus), while the presence of others is negatively related to the same environmental parameters (e.g., Graus nigra). Results suggest that larvae differently utilize these two areas as a refuge or for feeding, and that adults might be coupling their spawning periods with short-term oceanographic features. Larval fish assemblages of nearshore areas in northern Chile are described here for the first time and highlight the important role of these two areas in the early developmental stages of fish species.

AB A new ichnogenus and ichnospecies (Solealites ovalis) of etching trace is preserved on the surfaces of clasts from the Savignone Conglomerate (Oligocene) in the Palaeogene Piemonte Basin in NW Italy. It is a shallow, oval depression with a central elevation, which was produced probably by limpet gastropods and served as their home scar, but other gastropods or even sea anemones are not excluded as the trace makers. The conglomerate is interpreted as a deposit of a fan delta, whose clasts have been bioeroded in an intertidal and shallow subtidal shore zone and redeposited to the deeper sea.

AB Understanding the role of termite mounds in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is a priority for the management of tropical terrestrial protected areas dominated by savannahs. This study aimed to assess the effects of termite mounds on the diversity of plant functional types (PFTs) and herbaceous' net aboveground primary productivity (NAPP) in plant communities (PCs) of the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve. PCs were identified through canonical correspondence analysis performed on 96 phytosociological releves' realized in plots of 900m(2). PFTs' diversity was compared between savannahs and mounds' plots using generalized linear models. In each plot, 7m(2) subplots were harvested and NAPP was determined. Linear mixed models were performed to assess change in herbaceous NAPP regarding species richness, graminoids' richness, specific leaf area and termite mounds. There is no specific plant community related to mounds. However, the occurrence of termite mounds induced an increase of woody and forbs diversity while the diversity of legumes and graminoids decreased. These diversity patterns led to decreasing of PCs' NAPP. This study confirms that termite-induced resource heterogeneity supports niche differentiation theory and increased savannah encroachment by woody species.

AB The increasingly degrading dry tropical forests due to anthropogenic perturbations may further show significant species and individual loss under changing climate condition. It is attributed to the later effect on soil water and nutrient availability, which may variably change the competitive ability, and thus survival of tree species seedlings. Currently, determining the response of tree species seedlings to environmental changes in dry tropical ecosystem is a key challenge. Therefore, understanding of factors, which govern the seedling characteristics, are necessary for maintenance and regeneration of these forests. Here, we aim to examine that how nutrient, water and grass interactively affect the tree seedling survival and growth of four dry tropical species viz., Ziziphus mauritiana and Terminalia arjuna (nonleguminous), and Acacia nilotica and Acacia catechu (leguminous). These four species were subjected to eight different combinations of treatments based on water availability, nutrient supplementation and grass competition. Their responses in terms of survival and growth parameters (i.e. height, circumference, aboveground dry weight, number of leaves, leaf area and relative growth rate) were recorded in each combination. It was observed that water and nutrient interactively affected the seedling growth significantly. Under all treatment combinations, leguminous species exhibited higher survival than non-leguminous species, however, a reverse trend was observed for seedlings growth parameters. Presence of grass had significant negative effect on seedling growth in all treatment combinations; however nonleguminous species showed more pronounced effect than leguminous species. We observed a considerable variation in the seedlings growth response of different tree species to the variation in growth conditions in dry tropical environment. The study provides a mechanistic insight about the change in forest community structure with the environmental changes, which would help in devising some management strategies to conserve and restore the dry tropical forest.

AB Phenology and the floral visitors of Puya nitida and Puya trianae were evaluated at a paramo region of Chingaza National Natural Park, Colombia. During 1 year, field trips were made and diverse aspects of their spatial distribution, floral morphology and phenology, and their floral visitors were registered. Both, P. nitida and P. trianae present similar floral morphology fitting to ornithophily, but with differences in size and length of reproductive structures; both are separated spatially being dominant in different altitude and habitats; bloom in different times of the year indicating a clear temporal separation on blooming patterns. Both plants share visits from 2 bird species that because of their body differences can be adjusted to the flowers to place the pollen on different parts of their bodies and transport it to the correct plant in each visit. All these floral mechanisms from a spatio-temporal perspective, enable the use of the pollinators by P. nitida and P. trianae successfully, allowing coexistence among these 2 bromeliads, decreasing negative effects that may have in the pollen flow, outcrossing, and finally, in their sexual reproduction.

AB Understanding the ecology of large ungulates in southern Africa requires accurate and precise measures of population size. Recovery or exploitation of ungulates in reserves is currently instigated when population size changes exceed 15% per annum, but monitoring is usually undertaken with single counts from helicopters, for which precision and the power to detect change are untested. In essence, power being the strength of a monitoring result in showing change over time. Retrospective power analysis is a useful technique to investigate the variability of single-count aerial surveys. Using replicated helicopter-based counts of southern African ungulates and post hoc analysis, we investigated the power of currently used single-count surveys across five common ungulate species and 11 wildlife reserves. We expected high variability in count data and set alpha = 0.1 and 0.2 (alpha being the type I error rate), and asked two questions: 'How much does power vary in replicated aerial counts of southern African wildlife across reserves and species?' and 'Can current single-count aerial surveys detect population changes in response to management actions or are the statistical errors intractable?' Single counts were mostly unreliable; only one of 42 had sufficient power to detect meaningful changes in population size or their trends at alpha = 0.1, and only three had sufficient power at a = 0.2. Power varied widely according to species (e.g. warthog, median power at alpha = 0.1; 0.12-0.37: blue wildebeest, median power at alpha = 0.1; 0.23-0.74), and, within species, between replicates and reserves. Our retrospective calculations demonstrated insensitivity and ineffectiveness in most currently applied single counts from helicopters. Consequently, it is impossible to interpret the effects of ungulate conservation actions on many southern African reserves. Retrospective power analyses enables determination of which previous aerial surveys were useful for population assessment and adaptive management, and which should be discarded. We recommend that prospective power analyses are undertaken to determine future helicopter survey sample size and replication requirements, especially in small reserves.

AB Recent missions to Mount Nimba in West Africa led to the discovery of remarkable new ctenid morphospecies. Using both morphological and molecular data, we phylogenetically analysed 41 ctenid exemplars, 33 of which originate from Mt. Nimba. Partial fragments of two mitochondrial markers and one nuclear marker (COI, 16S and H3, respectively) were amplified and sequenced for the molecular analyses. The morphological analysis was updated from an earlier one. Our results reveal that Mt. Nimba harbours at least 22 species, and is the most species-rich area for ctenids in West Africa. Using both molecular and morphological data, five new genera are created to accommodate the many species that are misplaced in the genus Ctenus. Eight species new to science are described: Amicactenus mysticus gen. nov., sp. nov.; Macroctenus herbicola gen. nov., sp. nov.; Macroctenus nimba gen. nov., sp. nov.; Macroctenus vandenspiegeli gen. nov., sp. nov.; Nimbanahita montivaga gen. nov., sp. nov.; Perictenus molecula gen. nov., sp. nov.; Piloctenus haematostoma gen. nov., sp. nov.; and Piloctenus gryseelsi gen. nov., sp. nov. The following taxonomic changes are proposed: Ctenus eminens, C. pergulanus Arts, 1912 and C. fallax Steyn & Van der Donckt, 2003 are transferred to Amicactenus gen. nov.; C. kingsleyi and C. occidentalis F. 0. Pickard-Cambridge, 1898 are transferred to Macroctenus gen. nov.; C. rnirificus Arts, 1912 and C. pilosus Thorell, 1899 are transferred to Piloctenus gen. nay.

AB In this study, metal and metalloid concentrations and pathogens were measured in shellfish at different locations in a tropical estuary, including sites impacted by sewage and industry. Oyster, mangrove snails and mud snails did not exceed Australian and New Zealand Food Standards maximum levels for copper, lead or estimated inorganic arsenic at any site although copper concentrations in oysters and mud snails exceeded generally expected levels at some locations. Bacterial community composition in shellfish was species-specific regardless of location and different to the surrounding water and sediment. In the snails Telescopium telescopium, Terebralia palustris and Nerita balteata, some bacterial taxa differed between sites, but not in Saccostrea cucullata oysters. The abundance of potential human pathogens was very low and pathogen abundance or diversity was not associated with site classification, i.e. sewage impact, industry impact and reference.

AB Rapid assessment of plant size and population densities is important for estimating biomass over large areas, but it has often been limited by methods requiring intensive labor and resources. In this study, we demonstrate how shrub biomass can be estimated from fine-grained aerial photographs for a large area (23,000 ha) located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas, USA. Over the past 30 years, refuge land management has included the replanting of native shrubs to promote the restoration of wildlife habitat and carbon sequestration. To assess shrub regrowth, we developed a method to estimate individual shrub canopy areas from digital aerial imagery that was used to calculate biomass from allometric equations. The accuracy of the automated delineation of individual canopies was 79 % when compared to that of hand-digitized shrub canopies. When applied to photographs across the refuge, we found higher shrub densities for older naturally regenerated sites (174 individuals ha(-1)) compared to those of younger replanted sites (156 individuals ha(-1)). In contrast, naturally regenerated sites had less biomass (3.43 Mg ha(-1)) than replanted sites (4.78 Mg ha(-1)) indicating that shrubland restored for habitat conservation has the potential to sequester more carbon in a shorter period. There was an inverse relationship between aridity and aboveground shrub biomass for replanted sites in the drier west (p < 0.05). We found a difference in predicted biomass among shrub species in replanted sites that was also associated with climate (p < 0.05). We conclude that the canopy of individual shrubs detected from remote sensing can be used to estimate and monitor vegetation biomass over large areas across environmental gradients.

AB We evaluated changes in benthic algal community in grassland mountain streams converted to exotic pine afforestation. Three headwater streams draining grasslands and three draining plantations of Pinus elliottii were selected in a semiarid mountain watershed (Cordoba, Argentina). Hydraulic and physicochemical variables were recorded and benthic algal samples were collected in each stream at two hydrological periods (high and low flow). Light intensity was lower in afforested streams. Community composition differed between grassland and afforested streams. Algal abundance and richness, richness of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria, and the indicator taxa were reduced in afforested streams. Diversity, evenness and biomass were higher in the high water period but did not differ between riparian vegetation types. The observed changes in benthic algal attributes may have implications in ecosystem functioning because of the central role that algal biofilms play in the productivity of these fluvial systems, as sources of food, energy and oxygen.

AB Taiwan is located in the Western Pacific where typhoons and earthquakes frequently strike. The environment and geological conditions are sensitive and vulnerable to these phenomena. In recent years, rapid socio-economic growth has increasingly put pressure on land development on the island of Taiwan, causing frequent conflicts over land in mountain, river, and sea areas. Additionally, the increasing impact of climate change has made the maintenance of a stable equilibrium of the ecosystem, ensuring the survival of the population, and the sustainable development of the nation, important issues that must be actively faced, taking into account limitations on land and resources. "Doubly exposed" to globalization and global warming, Taiwan must actively ensure the balance between national land conservation for the future and economic development in its four regions. Taiwan must also coordinate regional development and effectively distribute resources among regions to achieve equal development and mitigate the challenges of resource shortages. Studies of carrying capacities have focused on environmental carrying capacity, recreational carrying capacity, and urban carrying capacity, mainly exploring the limits on population that are imposed by a single environmental system. Few studies of the amount of population that can be supplied by the land as part of the overall environmental system, the amount of available resources, the amount of consumption, the consumption differences and developmental issues, have been published. This study examines Taiwan's carrying capacity (resource supply side) from the perspective of "land resources", "food resources", and "carbon emissions". It determines the population size that can be supported by each resource to reveal the current levels of development of Taiwan's regions and future expected demands on each resource, and the carrying capacity of each resource in each region is compared with the ecological footprint (resource demand side) to support a discussion of regional adaptations.

AB Previous studies have found that macroalgal inclusion in formulated diets for cultured abalone improves feed utilisation, and it was suggested that seaweed-associated bacteria supply enzymes that aid in the animal's digestion. In the present study, we hypothesised that kelp supplementation in formulated feed affects the profile of digestive enzymes in farmed Haliotis midae. Commercially reared sub-adult abalone fed a kelp-supplemented (Ecklonia maxima; 0.88% dry weight) or kelp-free control feed were collected for analysis of the amylase, alginate lyase, laminarinase, fucoidanase and protease activities in the gut. Levels of polysaccharidase and protease activity did not significantly differ between the diet treatments. However, enzyme-activity levels were more variable in abalone fed the kelp-free diet as compared with those fed the kelp-supplemented diet (coefficients of variation: 73%, 48.3-60.2% and 31.9% [control diet] versus 42.7%, 13.6-33.8% and 14.6% [KS diet] for amylase, macroalgal polysaccharidases and acid protease activity, respectively). We suggest that the presence of dietary kelp modulates the abalone's gut bacteria and their nutrient exchange. Proteomic identification of proteins in abalone gut sections showed that exogenous enzymes associated with the gut microbiome aid in bacterial utilisation of digested molecules, whereas abalone endogenous enzymes degrade the macronutrients in formulated feeds.

AB To understand the impacts of reforestation on woody species composition, species diversity and community structure, seven plantation forests in dry-hot valley of the Jinsha River in Southwest China were investigated, with adjacent wastelands, natural shrub grassland and a natural forest as references. Species importance value, species richness, species heterogeneity and Sorenson similarity index between plantations and the natural forest were analyzed. Results indicated that compared to wastelands and natural shrub grassland, reforestation improved species diversity and community structure, and more forest woody species found suitable habitats in plantations. Species diversity in understory of plantations and Sorenson similarity index were significantly negatively correlated with stem density in mature plantations (26-31 years old). Higher species diversity and Sorenson similarity index existed in mature sparse plantations due to lower stem density and more tree species planted initially. In contrast, reference natural forest, with species heterogeneity of 2.28 for shrub layer, showed the highest species diversity. It would take a long time for species composition and diversity to recover through reforestation in a dry-hot valley. Therefore, it was essential to protect remnant natural forests strictly and reforest with suitable management such as lower stem density and increasing genetic diversity of trees planted.

AB Invasive species can have major impacts on ecosystems, yet little work has addressed the combined effects of multiple invaders that exploit different habitats. Two common invaders in aquatic systems are pelagic fishes and crayfishes. Pelagic-oriented fish effects are typically strong on the pelagic food web, whereas crayfish effects are strong on the benthic food web. Thus, co-invasion may generate strong ecological responses in both habitats. We tested the effects of co-invasion on experimental pond ecosystems using two widespread invasive species, one pelagic (western mosquitofish) and one benthic (red swamp crayfish). As expected, mosquitofish had strong effects on the pelagic food web, reducing the abundance of Daphnia and causing a strong trophic cascade (increase in phytoplankton). Crayfish had strong effects on the benthic food web, reducing the abundance of benthic filamentous algae. Yet, we also found evidence for important cross-habitat effects. Mosquitofish treatments reduced the biomass of benthic filamentous algae, and crayfish treatments increased Daphnia and phytoplankton abundance. Combined effects of mosquitofish and crayfish were primarily positively or negatively additive, and completely offsetting for some responses, including gross primary production (GPP). Though co-invasion did not affect GPP, it strongly shifted primary production from the benthos into the water column. Effects on snail abundance revealed an interaction; snail abundance decreased only in the presence of both invaders. These results suggest that cross-habitat effects of co-invaders may lead to a variety of ecological outcomes; some of which may be unpredictable based on an understanding of each invader alone.

AB The scale of resource heterogeneity may influence how resources are locally partitioned between co-existing large and small organisms such as trees and grasses in savannas. Scale-related plant responses may, in turn, influence herbivore use of the vegetation. To examine these scale-dependent bi-trophic interactions, we varied fertilizer [(nitrogen (N)/phosphorus (P)/potassium (K)] applications to patches to create different scales of nutrient patchiness (patch size 2 x 2 m, 10 x 10 m, or whole-plot 50 x 50 m) in a large field experiment in intact African savanna. Within-patch fertilizer concentration and the total fertilizer load per plot were independently varied. We found that fertilization increased the leaf N and P concentrations of trees and grasses, resulting in elevated utilization by browsers and grazers. Herbivory off-take was particularly considerable at higher nutrient concentrations. Scale-dependent effects were weak. The net effect of fertilization and herbivory was that plants in fertilized areas tended to grow less and develop smaller rather than larger standing biomass compared to plants growing in areas that remained unfertilized. When all of these effects were considered together at the community (plot) level, herbivory completely eliminated the positive effects of fertilization on the plant community. While this was true for all scales of fertilization, grasses tended to profit more from coarse-grained fertilization and trees from fine-grained fertilization. We conclude that in herbivore-dominated communities, such as the African savanna, nutrient patchiness results in the herbivore community profiting rather more than the plant community, irrespective of the scale of patchiness. At the community level, the allometric scaling theory's prediction of plant-and probably also animal-production does not hold or may even be reversed as a result of complex bi-trophic interactions.

AB Cat's claw creeper vine, Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) Lohmann (syn. Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) Gentry) (Bignoniaceae), is a major environmental weed in Australia. Two distinct forms of this weed ('long' and 'short' pod), with differences in leaf morphology and fruit size, occur in Australia. The long pod form has only been reported in less than fifteen localities in the whole of south-east Queensland, while the short pod form is widely distributed in Queensland and New South Wales. This study sought to compare growth traits such as specific leaf area, relative growth rate, stem length, shoot/root ratio, tuber biomass and branching architecture between these forms. These traits were monitored under glasshouse conditions over a period of 18 months. Short pod exhibited higher values of relative growth rates, stem length, number of tubers and specific leaf area than long pod, but only after 10 months of plant growth. Prior to this, long and short pod did not differ significantly. Higher values for these traits have been described as characteristics of successful colonizers. Results from this study could partly explain why the short pod form is more widely distributed in Australia while long pod is confined to a few localities.

AB The paper explores the potential of a method of analysis and evaluation in which the system of values are compared with the conditions of risk and degradation of landscape (due to environmental and man-made drivers) with the result of building maps of vulnerability, fragility and resilience.
   A set of italian coastal regions and landscapes constitutes the case study and are interpreted as geographical spaces with high levels of sensitivity. The research objective is to build a spatial decision support system based on indicators, in which the relative parameters are measured to represent the resilient capacity of the system, taking into account indicators relating to the integration of technological system, system-law system, social system and economic system. The global indicator system provides the basis upon which to assess how much a territorial system is resilient and smart. The SDSS logical model allows to build different scenarios and to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and spatial strategies analyzed as intervention hypothesis.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) can potentially alter food web dynamics by increasing the density of fishes within their borders. Such increases in the density of potential competitors can cause generalist predators to contract the scope of their diets. This study investigated the effects of increased conspecific fish density on the diets of gopher rockfish Sebastes carnatus at a 35 yr old MPA in Point Lobos, California, and at 4 newly established MPAs in Ano Nuevo, Point Lobos, Piedras Blancas, and Point Buch on in central California. Analyses were conducted for 707 stomachs collected from 2007 to 2009. Diets did not differ inside versus outside the old Point Lobos MPA in terms of prey richness, evenness, composition, or gopher rockfish trophic level. However, fish outside the MPA had greater levels of individual specialization. No consistent differences in these metrics were observed inside versus outside the 4 new MPAs, although prey composition and evenness did differ significantly among geographic locations. Diets at Ano Nuevo, the most northern and shallow location, consisted predominantly of Cancer spp. and porcelain crabs (Porcellanidae), while diets from southern, deeper locations were dominated by brittle stars (Ophiuroidea). The case study of the old Point Lobos MPA indicates that fish feeding ecology may not change in an MPA after several decades. Differences in prey observed among geographic locations suggest variation in the community composition among central California's new MPAs, which may influence the effect of each MPA on food web dynamics over time.

AB Shallow coral reefs threatened by climate change must be spatio-temporally analyzed in terms of their protection of coastal human populations. This study combines Japanese spatio-temporal gradients of population/asset and coral buffering exposure to stress-inducing and stress-mitigating factors so that the socio-economic and ecological (SEE) resilience tied to coral reefscapes can be regionally mapped (1200 km) at a fine resolution (1 arcsec) over a decade (11 years). Fuzzy logic was employed to associated environmental factors based on the related population/asset/coral buffering responses, as found in the literature. Once the factors were weighted according to their resilience contributions, temporally static patterns were evident: (1) a negative correlation occurs between coral buffering resilience and latitude; (2) the least resilient islands are low-lying, deprived of wide reef barriers, and located on the eastern and southern boundaries of the Nansei archipelago; (3) the southwestern-most, middle and northeastern-most islands have the same SEE resilience; and (4) Sekisei Lagoon islands have a very high coral buffering resilience. To overcome uncertainty, future studies should focus on the socio-ecological adaptive capacity, fine-scale ecological processes (such as coral and fish functional groups) and the prediction of the flood risks in the coming decades.

AB Seed pods of Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia nilotica have higher nutritive value than grasses and other browse plants during the dry season and form an important part of the diet of livestock. Seeds of Acacia may be destroyed during passage through the digestive tract of herbivores whereas seeds of other browse species can remain viable even after mechanical (chewing) and chemical (digestive) scarification. The seedling emergence, seedling establishment and recruitment of D. cinerea and A. nilotica seeds, dispersed by cattle and goats, were measured under natural conditions in the wet and dry seasons following sowing in the dry season. Seeds retrieved from goats and cattle, during the first 3 days and the last 4 days of the recovery period, and control seeds were subjected to the following planting methods: (1) seeds placed on top of the soil with no dung, (2) seeds buried to a depth of 2 cm in the soil with no dung, and (3) seeds buried to a depth of 2 cm in the soil with dung, in the wet and dry seasons. Significantly more A. nilotica and D. cinerea seeds were retrieved from cattle (40.0 +/- 3.6% and 25.7 +/- 3.9%, respectively), than goats (11.7 +/- 3.1% and 13.2 +/- 3.8%, respectively). There were significant interactions among animal species, seed-recovery day, planting and season for percentage seedling recruitment. Seedlings from seeds retrieved from goats (12.0 +/- 0.06%) had a significantly higher recruitment rate than from seeds retrieved from cattle (7.6 +/- 0.05%) and control seeds (i.e. no passage through the gut) (4.1 +/- 0.02%). Seedling recruitment rate was higher from seeds recovered from animals in the last 4 days of the recovery period and from D. cinerea than A. nilotica. The planting method of seeds buried to a depth of 2 cm in the soil with no dung had the highest seedling recruitment rate. We conclude that both goats and cattle may facilitate woody plant encroachment by enhancing seedling emergence.

AB Freshwater crayfish are reported to consume early life-history stages of a number of toxic amphibians. Although previous research indicates toxic amphibians are palatable to crayfish, the potential toxicity associated with consumption of toxic prey has been poorly described. We sought to characterise the supposed tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistance of freshwater crayfish, which have been observed to eat the eggs and larvae of toxic Taricha Gray, 1850 newts. White river crayfish (Procambarus acutus (Girard, 1852)) consumed 7.7 +/- 4.0 Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa (Skilton, 1849)) eggs (mean +/- SD) when offered 10 eggs in controlled feeding trials. Eggs were determined to contain a concentration of 1239 +/- 571 ng (mean +/- SD) of TTX. A dose-response assay was then performed to compare ingested doses with physiological TTX resistance. Crayfish were highly susceptible to TTX when administered as an intramuscular injection; TTX doses of 0.1 mass-adjusted mouse units were lethal to 100% of P. acutus crayfish. We established that while crayfish were capable consumers of highly toxic newt eggs, these decapods did not demonstrate physiological resistance to TTX. These findings suggest that crayfish have some functional resistance that renders them capable of consuming TTX-bearing prey despite a lack of physiological resistance to TTX.

AB We investigated fruit set, seed set, and germination requirements of shrubby reed-mustard (Hesperidanthus suffrutescens), an endangered endemic shrub in the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, U.S.A. To determine the degree of self-compatibility, 120 plants received four pollination treatments each for 2 y. Treatments included autogamy, geitonogamy, xenogamy, and an open control. Autogamy and geitonogamy produced substantially and significantly fewer fruits, seeds, and seeds per fruit than xenogamy, suggesting little self-compatibility. Additionally, the maternal reproductive success of outcrossed flowers was significantly greater than open control flowers suggesting pollen limitation, perhaps due to reduced pollinator abundance or activity. One study population showed significantly reduced reproduction during the second year, perhaps resulting from impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Although both selfing treatments produced significantly fewer seeds, there were no significant differences in germination among treatments. Potential pollinators were observed and collected during three sampling efforts. A total of 77 flower visitors were collected during the study. Potential pollinators providing outcrossed pollen included several Andrena species and several Lasioglossum and Halictus species. Overall, these results indicate little self-compatibility while suggesting that the pollinators needed for successful reproduction may, in fact, be limiting. This study highlights the important role of native pollinator fauna in conservation while providing managers with the basic reproductive ecology needed to conserve this endemic desert shrub.

AB The objective of this work was to study the effects of washing and purification steps on qualitative and quantitative analysis of fecal stanols in the oyster Crassostrea gigas using either single or a combination of lipid purification steps on silica gel or aminopropyl bonded silica gel (NH2) or a washing step. Among the three analytical pathways compared, the two including water extraction or NH2 purification did not lead to higher recoveries and decreased repeatabilities of extractions compared to the single purification on silica gel. This latter led to similar recoveries (ca. 80 %) and repeatabilities (ca. 10 %) for both spiked standards (coprostanol and sitostanol). This analytical pathway has been applied to oysters collected in a harvesting area in Brittany (France) where fecal contaminations are important and allowed to quantify eight stanols in oysters. The relative proportions of fecal stanols of these oysters were combined with principal component analysis in order to investigate the usefulness of their stanol fingerprints to record a fecal contamination and to distinguish its source between human, porcine and bovine contaminations. Oysters non-fecally contaminated by Escherichia coli did not present specific stanol fingerprints while oysters fecally contaminated had a bovine fingerprint, suggesting a contamination of these samples by bovine sources. As a consequence, the method developed here allows the use of stanol fingerprints of oysters as a microbial source tracking tool that can be applied to shellfish harvesting areas subjected to fecal contaminations in order to identify the different sources of contamination and improve watershed management.

AB Resilience is often a contested concept, but it appears to have an important role in Disaster Risk Reduction. Resilience focuses upon positive outcomes and implies a series of risk factors, environmental factors, and interpersonal factors. In this paper, resilience will be read as interpretation capacity and reaction alertness, in relation to a geographical and cultural context. Considering these characterizing factors of resilience, it is proposed as an experimental interdisciplinary and international tool of risk education, where the concept of resilience is revised in relation with landscape, in order to promote a "resilientscape". "REthinking the landscape" is a place-based, bottom-up tool that involves different approaches, taken from geography, arts, history and botany, developed in the context of a museum in Funchal (Madeira island). The hypothesis of this paper is that population has in itself the ability to cope with disasters and risk. Accordingly, the main purposes are to unearth community capacity and to lay the groundwork for community participation in DRR according to PDRA strategies.
   The first part of the paper discusses the role of participation in building landscape resilience against natural hazards. The second part introduces and discusses the characteristics of the aforementioned tool, its strategies, goals, and experiments, starting with the work on landscape education conducted by Castiglioni (2012).

AB The concept of a varying evolutionary tempo that is regulated by energy was first suggested in the 1950s. It was based on the observation that energy-rich habitats appear to be the centres of evolutionary change, producing novel characters more frequently and having greater speciation rates. Subsequently, a number of studies have found positive relationships between evolutionary rate and energy. Gradients of energy occur across a range of scales and these have been invoked to explain, for example, higher tropical species richness. Precipitation has also been found to influence evolutionary rate, suggesting that biologically available energy and productivity are the important variables in the relationship rather than solar energy alone. Here, we take the theoretical step of investigating at smaller scales the implications of faster evolutionary tempo where productivity is greater: first at the level of the species population and, subsequently, for the same-guild co-habitants in a community. To facilitate, this we begin by applying the concept of gradients of available energy, from more productive to less productive sectors within the species niche, in the context of source-sink theory. We then propose that a species population will have its highest rate of evolution, for changes that confer a positive selection coefficient throughout the niche, in that sector where it has best adaptive fit and greatest per capita energy flux. We also posit that, where it conferred a shift in fitness, an evolutionary change at niche optimum could subsequently affect conspecific populations occupying lower energy niche sectors via the selection-mediated dispersal of the apomorphy into the more marginal components of the niche. We then infer that this type of change in a species with a generally higher per capita energy flux might negatively affect adjacent more slowly evolving species (living in less productive peripheral niches) in situations where the increased fitness conferred by a particular apomorphy was relevant to conditions occurring beyond the limits of the progenitor niche hypervolume. We therefore suggest a directional component to evolution at the compressed scales of niche and community level microevolution whereby populations and species occupying more productive conditions have greater tempos of change with attendant enhancements of both their competitive influence and their evolutionary potential. In this manner, previously recorded macro-evolutionary patterns indicating faster evolution with increased energy at larger scales are interpreted in the context of proposed micro-evolutionary relationships at intraspecific and locally interspecific scales.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 696-714.

AB In recent years, there have been declines of varying severity in many vertebrate species across much of the sparsely populated savannas of northern Australia, and adding to the dismal record of extinctions from arid and semi-arid central Australia since European colonization. It is likely that multiple factors are responsible for the current wave of extinctions, but they are occurring in areas of sparse human population in extensive, seemingly unmodified landscapes. Habitat change is one likely contributing factor, with invasive exotic grasses an important component in some regions. Historically, conservation of native vertebrates has been poor in Australia, with many species being considered vermin under legislation. As late as the 1960s much scientific research was aimed at controlling species that are now considered threatened under legislation. Through the 20th century substantial efforts to introduce exotic pasture species saw the introduction for trial of twice as many species of grasses and legumes as occur naturally on the whole Australian continent. The legacy of these programs is the spread of grasses that, through a range of processes, lead to simplification of floristic structure and reduction in plant species diversity and habitat suitability for many native mammals. Management of these invasive species should focus on preventing their spread into and establishment in new regions, and controlling them where they are established. State and transition models may provide a framework for considering the management and environmental triggers that could lead to re-establishment of native grasses. (C) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB This study investigated seedling emergence in field sowings in terms of rate, and maximum seedling emergence, for twenty one species of forb, grass and geophyte species associated with montane South African grassland communities. Species were sown in early and late spring to compare the effect of sowing date on emergence characteristics and subsequent growth. RGR and mean individual standing biomass were calculated for a 150 day post sowing growth window. Species showed highly significant differences in the time taken to achieve 50% emergence, and species rankings on this basis changed according to the date of sowing. There were large differences in RGR between species that were also reflected in mean standing biomass per individual. The data provide a basis for a preliminary, comparative ecological characterization of these species and an insight into how these species establish and potentially avoid competitive elimination in mixed sowings in restoration ecology or in landscape architecture, in the first growing season. The study also provides some indication on how emergence and growth of individual species might affect recruitment and survival in their habitats. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Copepod fecal pellet (fp) dissolved organic matter is consumed by free-living bacteria, while particulate matter is degraded by bacteria packed inside the fp ('internal') or attached to the fp surface after colonization from the environment (external). This study analyzed the contribution of 'internal' and external fp bacteria to the active bacterial community associated with the fp from 2 copepod species, Paramphiascella fulvofasciata and Platychelipus littoralis, during 60 h of fp aging in seawater. Despite early colonization (within 20 to 40 h), fp enrichment by seawater bacteria, as deduced from RNA-based DGGE after 60 h, was limited. In contrast, 'internal' bacteria showed high phylotype richness. The majority of 'internal' bacterial phylotypes persisted on aged fp and together represented half of the active bacterial community. Food source strongly impacted 'internal' bacterial diversity, though the exact origin of fp 'internal' bacteria, as either undigested food-associated bacteria or as copepod gut bacteria, could not be unambiguously determined. 'Internal' bacteria of fresh fp showed a high functional diversity (based on Biolog assays) to which Vibrio sp. contributed significantly. In terms of bacterial diversity and functional potential, degradation of copepod fp by 'internal' bacteria is equally as important as degradation by bacteria which colonize fp from the outside.

AB The structure and composition of savanna vegetation is influenced by resource availability and disturbance. Grasses, a major component of savanna systems, influence the tree-grass balance by competing with trees for light, water and soil nutrients as well as providing fuel for fires. Overgrazing, and the ensuing decreased grass competition and fire effects resulting from diminished grass vigor and cover, are thought to be major drivers of bush encroachment. To investigate impacts of competition from grass on saplings of Acacia karroo Hayne. and Acacia nilotica (L.). Willd. ex. Del. under high and low soil fertility, six grass species, Aristida junciformis (Trin & Rupr.), Eragrostis capensis (Thunb.) Trin., Hyparrhenia hirta Stapf., Panicum maximum Jacq., Sporobolus africanus (Poir.) Robyns & Tournay and Themeda triandra Forssk., were planted in pots with a tree sapling as the central test species. The major competitive effects experienced by tree saplings were dependent on nutrient level and the identity of the competing grass species (P < 0.001). Aboveground A. karroo was more strongly affected by grass competition under high nutrient conditions, whereas an increase in nutrient level had little effect on the competition between A. nilotica and the grasses (P < 0.001). Acacia karroo was also strongly affected by grass competition belowground; however, the opposite trend was observed for A. nilotica (P < 0.001). Eragrostis capensis was one of the most competitive grass species, reducing sapling aboveground biomass by 85% and 65% under high and low nutrient conditions, respectively, and sapling belowground biomass by 71% on average. Increasing nutrient availability resulted in an increase in competition exerted on A. karroo by all grasses but little to no change for A. nilotica. Changes in savanna composition and structure are thus likely to be influenced by grass species composition and soil nutrient status.

AB Track census is a widely used method for rapid faunal assessments, which assumes that differences in track count numbers mainly reflect differences in species abundance due to some biological factors. However, some methodological and climatic variables might affect results of track censuses. Here, we tested the effect of climatic variables, such as maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed or days since last rain, and methodological factors such as censusing day period, distance from transect to vegetation edge, substrate condition or observer, on the number of tracks of mammal carnivores and some of their potential prey detected in sandy substrates. We sampled 2x 2 km(2) located within the scrubland area of Do ana National Park (southwestern Spain) for carnivore and several potential prey tracks. Our results showed differences in the number of tracks detected between observers and a significant interaction between observers and the day period when censuses were carried out. Moreover, the variables increasing the quality of the substrate (higher environmental humidity, lower wind speed and days since last rain) not only led to a greater detection of carnivore tracks but, depending on the size of the species sampled other variables such as distance from transects to the vegetation border, also affected results. We recommend restricting sampling to certain fixed weather conditions when planning to monitor relative animal abundance from track censuses. When not possible, climatic or methodological variables should be included as covariates in analyses that try to test for the biological factors affecting wildlife abundance, taking into account that these variables, which affect the number of tracks detected could vary between years.

AB The effects of marine reserves on the growth and mortality rates of 2 commonly exploited (Helcion concolor and Scutellastra longicosta) and 2 rarely exploited (Cellana capensis and Scutellastra granularis) limpets were investigated at 2 reserve and 2 non-reserve sites in South Africa. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) growth of commonly exploited species would be reduced in reserves due to higher densities and stronger intraspecific competition, with no effect for rarely exploited species; (2) commonly exploited species would show higher mortality rates outside than inside reserves, with no effect for rarely exploited species. Both the exploited H. concolor and C. capensis (sometimes mistaken for H. concolor by harvesters) exhibited faster growth at non-reserve sites where their densities were generally lower. No effect of reserve status was detected for the growth rates of S. granularis (rarely exploited) or S. longicosta (commonly exploited). S. longicosta showed no reserve effect on growth because it is territorial, and density has no effect on territory size. Reserve effects were only observed for the survival probability of S. longicosta, the most commonly exploited species, and the probability of capture (but not survival) of the 2 rarely exploited species. The results indicate that the effects of reserves on growth and mortality are species-specific and are difficult to generalize even within the categories of commonly and rarely exploited limpets.

AB One important subject is to determine the effectiveness of conservation areas, where different management categories are being applied, to maintain effective sexual reproduction in plants and their interactions with animal groups. To evaluate this issue, we compared the phenology, reproductive success, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation of the legume tree Senna multijuga in two differently managed protected areas in Southeastern Brazil: the Itatiaia National Park and the Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari, front December 2007 to December 2008. Vegetative and reproductive phenodinamycs were registered monthly in 80 individuals; other evaluations included 104 observation hours for pollination (March-May 2008) in 51 inflorescences; besides, fruit counts, fecundity and seed predation. Sexual reproduction of S. multijuga depends on the transfer of pollen by large bees (Bombus, Centris, Epicharis and Xylocopa), as the species is self-incompatible. Bruchidae species of the genus Acanthoscelides and Sennius predate seeds. Vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics differed among sites. Our results indicated that ecological interactions were lower at the protected area, but the reproductive processes in S. multijuga were not ruptured or critically degraded. This reinforces the idea that landscape areas with intermediate levels of protection, such as environmental protection areas, are suitable as buffer zones, and thus, relevant to the conservation of ecological processes when associated with more strictly protected areas.

AB Myrmeleon brasiliensis larvae are predators that use the sit-and-wait tactic to catch their prey, and to fulfill this pit-making funnel traps in the sandy soil and remain buried waiting for prey to slip. The objective of this study was to observe the predation behavior of larvae of M. brasiliensis in the three larval instars, for this leaf cut ant were collected manually and offered within the plastic pots as prey for 14 larvae of 1(st) instar larvae, 33 of 2(nd) and 3(rd) instar. It was counted the number of attacks of the predator to prey, the number of escapes from jail and the success of prey capture for each larva of M brasiliensis. The larvae of M. brasiliensis 1(st) instar attacked more times its prey, followed by larvae of 2(nd) and 3(rd) instar. On the number of escape of prey, there was no significant difference in this behavior among larvae. Regarding the success in capturing prey, the larvae of 3rd instar were more successful, with a predation rate of 96.96%, followed by the larvae of 2(nd) (69.70%) and 1(st) instar (14.28 %).

AB Nitrogen enrichment has often been demonstrated to enhance the success of introduced plant species at the expense of native species. In the south Puget lowland prairies of Washington State, invasion by Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), a nitrogen-fixing legume, is associated with elevated soil nitrogen levels. After broom removal, the higher soil nitrogen levels may have facilitated the secondary invasion of the prairies by numerous non-native species, particularly rhizomatous pasture grasses that can interfere with native plant seedling establishment. Numerous studies have shown the potential for carbon addition to immobilize soil nitrogen and reduce the success of introduced species relative to native species. We compared the available soil nitrate, the cover of native and introduced species between sugar-addition (1000 g C m(-2)) and control plots on two Puget lowland prairies. Sugar treatment initially immobilized nitrate and reduced cover of introduced species compared to that on control plots, but these effects dissipated within two years. Moreover, after four years, cover of introduced species, especially that of Agrostis capillaris and Hypochaeris radicata, had rebounded to become higher in sugar-addition than in control plots. In contrast, native species showed no negative responses to sugar treatment, suggesting that where sugar or other carbon treatment is economically feasible, combining carbon with the establishment of a high density of native species might limit the potential for introduced species to rebound.

AB The larger sex in sexually size dimorphic bird species generally requires more food than the smaller sex does, but parents often fail to meet the needs of their larger offspring. Here we analyze nest attendance of Nazca Booby (Sula granti, a seabird with female-larger sexual size dimorphism) parents and offspring during the period of mobile dependence, when offspring can fly but still attend the nest to receive meals. We tested the null hypothesis that parental care to male and female offspring during this period does not differ, complementing previous data on the pre-fledging period. We used attendance to infer the duration of parental care by mothers and fathers, separately, with respect to offspring sex. The duration of the parental association with their offspring during this period, and offspring growth, did not differ by offspring sex, and parental care apparently ended when offspring vacated the natal colony. The number of days parents were observed at their nest site during the post-fledging dependency period did not differ by offspring sex. Our results indicate similar parental care for male and female offspring during the post-fledging dependency period, despite female offspring probably requiring more care than males to reach the same level of condition.

AB Seed ecology may play a role in the widespread increase of Acacia karroo in savanna and grassland. Accordingly, fecundity, predation, mortality by fire, dispersal by livestock, and seed longevity were studied. Seed production per tree (P of pod production, pods per tree) was positively related to tree height, negatively related to tree density, and was greater for sites receiving run-on. Predispersal predation by bruchids, cerambycids, and wasps depleted seed production by 18%. The ant Messor capensis effectively eliminated surface seed except during the early dry season following seed shed. Rodent predation of seed was minimal. Fires 100 degrees C killed most exposed seed but a thin layer of soil increased survival and maintained germinability. A greater proportion of ingested seeds passed through cattle (57%) and sheep (50%) than through goats (15%). 50% of seeds were recovered within 48 h. During passage, soft seeds were digested, some hard seeds were softened, but most were egested as hard seeds; germinability was not increased. Cattle were confirmed as dispersal agents. Using experimental seed banks, it was shown that buried or surface-exposed seeds did not persist for longer than a year, but 24% of surface-shaded seeds persisted for two years. Most seeds germinated but most buried seeds died before emergence. Seed persistence in deep shade should facilitate invasion into grassland. Seed banks of. A. karroo did not exceed 18 seeds m-2 because of the above-described effects. Seed availability (fecundity, dispersal by cattle, seed longevity) is concluded to contribute to the invasiveness of A. karroo, but use of fire may offer partial control of seed availability.

AB 1. Two ecological risks associated with the use of transgenic crops are transgene movement into wild populations and effects on non-target organisms, such as pollinators. Despite the importance of pollinators, and their contribution to the global food supply, little is known about how they are affected by transgenic crops. Pollinator preferences affect plant mating patterns; thus understanding the effects of transgenic crops on pollinators will aid in understanding transgene movement.
   2. Honey bee and squash bee visit number and duration were recorded on conventional and transgenic virus-resistant squash Cucurbita pepo planted in a randomized block design. Floral characters were measured to explain differences in pollinator behaviour. The effect of Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus infection on pollinator behaviour was also examined.
   3. Honey bees visited female conventional flowers more than female transgenic flowers. Conventional flowers were generally larger with more nectar than transgenic flowers, although. oral traits did not account for differences in pollinator visitation.
   4. Squash bees visited male transgenic flowers more than male conventional flowers; squash bees also spent more time in female transgenic flowers than in female conventional flowers. Transgenic flowers were significantly larger with greater amounts of sweeter nectar and they were present in greater number. Floral traits accounted for some of the variation in pollinator visitation.
   5. Squash bee visit number and duration did not differ between virus-infected and healthy plants, but this may be because pollinator behaviour was observed early in the virus infection.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator behaviour controls patterns of plantmating thus non-target effects of transgenic resistance, such as those observed here, may influence transgene movement into wild populations. These results suggest that transgenic crops should not be planted within the native range of wild relatives because pleiotropic effects may affect crop-wild hybridization and transgene introgression into wild populations.

AB Wildlife conservation plans generally require reliable data about population abundance and density. Aerial surveys often can provide these data; however, associated costs necessitate designing and conducting surveys efficiently. We developed methods to simulate population distributions of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) wintering in western Mississippi, USA, by combining bird observations from three previous strip-transect surveys and habitat data from three sets of satellite images representing conditions when surveys were conducted. For each simulated population distribution, we compared 12 primary survey designs and two secondary design options by using coefficients of variation (CV) of population indices as the primary criterion for assessing survey performance. In all, 3 of the 12 primary designs provided the best precision (CV <= 11.7%) and performed equally well ((CV) over bar (diff) <= 0.6%). Features of the designs that provided the largest gains in precision were optimal allocation of sample effort among strata and configuring the study area into five rather than four strata, to more precisely estimate mallard indices in areas of consistently high density. Of the two secondary design options, we found including a second observer to double the size of strip transects increased precision or decreased costs, whereas ratio estimation using auxiliary habitat data from satellite images did not increase precision appreciably. We recommend future surveys of mallard populations in our study area use the strata we developed, optimally allocate samples among strata, employ PPS or EPS sampling, and include two observers when qualified staff are available. More generally, the methods we developed to simulate population distributions from prior survey data provide a cost-effective method to assess performance of alternative wildlife surveys critical to informing management decisions, and could be extended to account for effects of detectability on estimates of true abundance.

AB Quantifying the rate of propagule release is of most importance to estimate reproductive output of natural populations, but simple methods to obtain such data are seldom reported. We designed and tested an inexpensive apparatus capable of reliably measure the release of gametes, eggs or larvae of sessile marine invertebrates in vertical walls. A population of the acom barnacle Chthamalus bisinuatus was sampled with this trap over 68d to obtain a time series of naupliar release. An apparent semilunar trend is shown, indicating the effectiveness of this sampling method.

AB July 1998 approximately 2.5 x 10(8) of recently-spawned Mercenaria spp. larvae were intentionally released in the northernmost basin of the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, to characterize the initial dispersion from a point source at time scales of hours to days. Larval densities measured with a quantitative molecular method indicated ambient concentrations were enhanced by 10 larvae L-I near surface drifters released with the larvae. Surface distributions from samples collected near the drifters indicate that larval patches developed during the first day. Diffusive processes evaluated from dye releases yield apparent diffusivity coefficients that suggest diffusive processes could spread larvae over several km(2) within 2 d. Our observations suggest that high-resolution methods for mapping larvae are essential to better resolve spatial distribution evolution at time scales of hours to days, and spatial scales of tens to hundreds of meters. This capability could better define the temporal evolution of larval distributions following a mass spawning event.

AB The study compared plant and avian diversity and species composition between four habitats to review the potential implications of two distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland by planting Ficus and Acacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.

AB Questions: Have Namib endemics evolved from old or recent evolutionary lines? What are their phylogenetic patterns at different levels of taxonomic order? What is the role of environmental factors in determining current distributions?
   Data description: Distribution of central Namib plant endemics and environmental indices, based on field surveys and published sources.
   Method of analysis: Chi-squared and G-tests to examine differences in phylogenetic aspects, growth form, and dispersal spectra between endemic and non-endemic flora. Canonical correspondence analysis to investigate the effect of environmental variables on the distribution of plant endemics in a 15-minute interval geographic grid.
   Conclusions: Central Namib endemics have probably descended from old evolutionary lines in contrast to those in the southern Namib. Different selective forces are therefore likely to be driving evolution in different parts of the Namib Desert. Although leaf-succulents are over-represented among both central Namib and southern Namib endemics, leaf-succulents in the central Namib are likely to be a result of former environmental conditions (i.e. winter rainfall) and/or the influence of fog, in contrast to the southern Namib where phylogenetics play a more important role. Species-specific responses are indicated among the Namib endemics, as the influence of fog seems to be important for some, and substrate conditions for others. These need to be taken into account when predictions are made regarding broad-scale biogeographic patterns and when modelling the effect of climate change.

AB The development of standards and guidelines to secure sustainable forest management at different geographical scales has expanded greatly during the past fifteen years. Most of these efforts, however, have been formulated for natural forests only; those designed specifically for forest plantations are relatively few. The global forest plantation area is expanding rapidly, with obvious positive and negative impacts on biodiversity. We characterize the key concepts of biodiversity in tropical and subtropical forest plantations and present an analysis of how these elements are covered in the eight principal operational standards and guidelines for sustainable plantation forestry. We also examine the applicability of standards and guidelines in plantations established and managed under different initial settings. The results indicate that the standards and guidelines address certain key elements of biodiversity comprehensively, meanwhile others are ignored or receive only slight attention. There is also substantial variation between the sets in their nature (performance- vs. process-based), scope, congruity in concepts and hierarchy, and specificity. The standards and guidelines seldom take into account the varying initial settings for plantation establishment and the consequent variation in critical factors in biodiversity conservation and management. We recommend that standards and guidelines should be developed so as to pay more attention to the type and operating environment of plantations, to cover all key factors of biodiversity, and to consider building closer relationships between the social and ecological aspects of biodiversity.

AB Lauandula stoechas subsp. pedunculata regeneration depends exclusively on the establishment of new individuals. Seed availability and seedling emergence and survival are therefore critical life stages and processes for species regeneration. in this study, seedling emergence and survival was monitored for two years in the scrub, both in clearings and adjacent to adult plants, and the surrounding perennial grassland, at 1, 3 and 5 m from the scrub. Soil seed bank spatial distribution was also studied for one year in the same two habitats, using the same sampling design. Soil seed availability in the scrub is high regardless of the distance from the adult individuals. On the contrary, the adjacent grassland shows a drastic fall in seed density, and almost no seedlings were observed there. In the scrub, seedling density was negatively related to distance from the three nearest adult plants in the clearings, and positively related to adult plant size beneath the adult Lavandula plants. There was also a negative relationship between seedling density and the percentage of bare soil. Only one seedling survived the first drought period, with no detection of effects of either position with respect to adult individuals or seedling density. We hypothesized that the study populations suffer a lack of appropriate safe sites within the scrubland while in the adjacent perennial grassland, observed low seed availability was added to safe-site limitation. That results in a lack of successful seedling establishments and a poor expansion potential of Lauandula scrublands, whose edges remain static in the short and medium term. As found in other Mediterranean scrubland, recruitment may only occur in years with particularly favourable weather, under disturbance regimes that increase seedling survival probability or when external dispersal agents increased seed availability in adequate places for Lavandula establishment.

AB The dynamics of the unpalatable Aristida spp. (wiregrasses) were measured in a subset of treatments contained within an extensive grazing study conducted between 1990 and 1996 in H. contortus pasture in southern Queensland. This paper reports the results from these treatments which included 2 land classes (silver-leaved and narrow-leaved ironbark), 3 stocking rates (0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 beasts/ha) in both native pasture and legume-oversown native pasture, all in the absence of fire.
   Changes in plant density and basal area of Aristida spp. reflected differences in both the survival and size of existing plants together with a large seedling recruitment in 1991. Two different taxa of Aristida spp. were distinguished; however, there were no clear differences in the response of these 2 taxa to the treatments. Grazing had the greatest impact on population dynamics through reducing basal area as stocking rate increased. Neither landscape position nor legume over-sowing had a major impact on Aristida spp.
   The results suggest that populations of Aristida spp. will be highest under light grazing and that seedling recruitment may be episodic.

AB A 30-day feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the dietary selectivity in Chinese shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis. Six groups of shrimp with initial body weight of 1.530 +/- 0.047 g (mean +/- SD, n = 6) were used, in which the first five groups were fed to satiation with single diets of FF, flesh of fish (Sardinella zunasi); SF, flesh of shrimp (Trachypenaeus curvirostris); CF, foot of clam (Ruditapes varigata); PW, polychaette worm (Neanthes japonica) FD, a commercial formulated diet; and the last group received MD, mixed diet. The feeding trials were conducted simultaneously and shrimp were fed to satiation. The specific growth rate (SGR), food intake (FI), food conversion efficiency (FCE), and apparent digestive ratio (ADR) were determined. The results showed that specific growth rates of dry weight, protein, and energy (SGR(d), SGR(p), and SGR(e)) were highest in the MD fed group, food conversion efficiencies (FCEd, FCEp, and FCRe) were highest at PW fed group. Food ingestion in terms of dry weight, protein, and energy were significantly higher in CF and MD fed groups than others. The highest ADR was observed in CF fed group. In mixed diet feeding group, percentages of the five ingested diets to the total ingested amount based on dry material, protein, and energy were: FF, 13.07%; SF, 9.60%; CF, 46.45%; PW, 30.88%; and FD, 0%; FF, 15.56%; SF, 11.44%; CF, 45.09%; PW, 27.91%; and FD, 0%; FF, 13.66%; SF, 10.48%; CF, 44.00%; PW, 31.86%; and FD, 0%; respectively. This indicates that Chinese shrimp possess the ability to discriminate different diets. The optimal foraging strategy of Chinese shrimp in this experiment was to gain energy as much as possible to meet energy needs of variable physiologic activities under the premise of maximizing growth. Additionally, the protein sparing effect of dietary E/P ratio and lipid content was also observed in this experiment.

AB On cobbled shores, limpets are exposed to various abiotic environmental factors whose harshness and patterns of seasonal fluctuation differ from shore to shore. As a result, the density of limpets in each season and the pattern of their seasonal fluctuation might also vary among shores. This idea was examined by investigating the relationship between coverage of cobbles, an important abiotic factor, and the density of Patelloida striata, an abundant species of limpet in subtropical Japan. These were estimated by seasonal quadrat samplings on three cobbled shores on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, from June 1997 to September 1998. The above-mentioned idea was supported by the following two results: (1) The coverage of cobbles showed a sharp seasonal fluctuation on only one shore on which freshwater runoff sporadically transported sand onto cobbles; on this shore, the density of P. striata was significantly higher than on the other shores in most seasons; and (2) on this shore, which was severely disturbed, seasonal fluctuation in the density of P. striata correlated significantly with a sharp seasonal fluctuation in the coverage of cobbles; as a consequence, the seasonal fluctuation in density was greater on this shore than on the other shores. The first result is discussed in relation to the small body size (<24.3mm in shell length) and ephemerality (<2 years in life-span) of P. striata, both suggesting that this species adapts to abiotically harsh environments. The second result is discussed in relation to the functions of cobbles for P. striata such as the providing of feeding grounds and shelter.

AB Phymactis clematis Drayton is the most abundant and one of the largest species of sea anemone along the South American coast. Likewise other sea anemone species, the adults of the P. clematis would have an active ability to make local movements. However, these have not been properly described, and causal factors are unknown. In this work we try to describe some of the basic patterns associated to the local movement behavior in P. clematis, assessed indirectly from the presence of bare rock halos around individuals in two rocky inter-tidal sites in the coast of northern Chile (Cavancha and Colorado Chico). Movements were more frequent and had a higher intensity at Colorado Chico, where over 50% of individuals showed movements, although they were mainly lower than 60 mm in length. At Colorado Chico, movements would occur in individuals larger than 40 mm of pedal diameter, whereas their intensity would decrease with body size. We discussed that causes of higher movement activity at Colorado Chico could be associated to the higher abundance and lower inter-individual spacing, which would produce physical interference among individuals. In this way, we suggested that the patterns associated to the individual's body size would arise secondarily, being dependent on the levels of local abundance. Despite local movements of P. clematis at Colorado Chico occurred at a scale of a few centimeters, they could be affecting significantly the inter-individual spacing increasing the average nearest neighbor distance. We argue that local movements could be an effective mechanism reducing the intraspecific competition in P. clematis.

ID ANAEROBIC TREATMENT; NIGHT SOIL; ANTARCTIC BACTERIA; FATTY-ACIDS;
   DIGESTION; BIOGAS
AB Microbial degradation of organic wastes mainly comprising animal and human wastes, is drastically reduced at extreme low temperatures. For the biodegradation of these wastes, technological inputs are required from disciplines like microbiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, digester modelling and heat transfer at extreme low temperature climates. Various steps in the process of biodegradation have to be studied to formulate an effective organic waste disposal method. Anaerobic digestion of organic wastes is preferred over aerobic waste treatment method, since it yields biogas as a by-product, which in turn can be utilised for heating the digester contents to increase its efficiency. Furthermore, one of the possibilities that can be explored is the utilisation of high rate anaerobic digesters which maintain temperature by means of artificial heating. It is either met by non-conventional energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, or by expending liquid fuels. In addition, insulation of the digester with polymeric materials and immobilisation of slow growing bacterial population may enhance the digester performance to a great extent. In spite of several developments, inoculum adaptation is considered to be one of the essential steps for low temperature anaerobic digestion to obtain methane as a by-product. With advancements in recombinant DNA technology, it may be possible to increase the efficiency of various microbial population that take part in the anaerobic digestion. However, till date, the options available for low temperature biodegradation are digester insulation, inoculum adaptation, and use of high rate/second-generation digesters.

AB The highest concentrations of inorganic N were found in soils from the cliffs where yellow legged gulls breed, but only the cliffs with the highest density of gulls showed significant differences, in both summer and winter, from control sites (without gulls). The levels of inorganic forms of N were significantly higher in summer than in winter, possibly due to loss by leaching during autumn and winter. Results obtained also showed large year to year variations in concentrations of NH4+-N. The input of inorganic N to these soils via gull excrement may be one of the factors contributing to the changes in the composition of the flora found on the cliffs of the Cies Islands.

AB Prey utilisation at low prey densities was determined for third instar Cueta sp., Furgella intermedia (Markl) and Palpares annulatus (Stitz) larvae in terms of wet weight, dry weight, energy and nutrients. Prey utilisation was similar to other insects on a wet weight (42-47%), dry weight (46-49%), energetic (40-58%) and nutritive basis (62-79%), Lipids (33-36%) provided energetically the highest contribution of the nutrients ingested, The quantities of water, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates extracted by the antlion larvae were in proportion to their availability in their prey, the Hodotermes mossambicus larvae, The quantities of nutrients extracted by the antlion larvae at low prey densities were not significantly influenced by the differences in mandible size, antlion body weight or the trapping method (building a pit or not) of the antlion species, It is proposed that a low metabolic rate and the accumulation of fat reserves, and not the extent of prey utilisation, enable P. annulatus larvae to tolerate a 123-d starvation period in which 22.3% of their body weight is lost.

AB The efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (B.t.i.) and temephos in controlling the pest blackfly Simulium chutteri Lewis along the middle Orange River between 1990 and 1995, was assessed. Larvicides were applied by helicopter to rapids and riffles between Hopetown and Onseepkans, a river distance of 807 km. Larvicidal efficacy was based on the change in larval abundance at selected sites before and after each treatment. The success of the control programme was assessed independently by local farmers, who ranked adult blackfly annoyance on a 4-point scare.
   Before treatment, blackfly annoyance showed consistent peaks in spring, and sometimes in autumn, and levels were unacceptably high for between 17 and 36 weeks of the year. After treatment started, blackfly annoyance levels were reduced significantly. The number of annual treatments necessary to reduce blackfly annoyance to acceptable levels was highly variable (3-13), and depended on river conditions, as well as the efficacy and timing of each treatment. During low-flow conditions (<50 m(3)/s), applications became increasingly difficult in braided sections of the river, and dosage calculations were inaccurate because of local abstraction and return flows. Both larvicides worked well in winter (water temperature 11-13 degrees C). Control of the spring outbreak can be planned well in advance, with the first treatment starting in mid July. A flexible protocol is required to control outbreaks at other times of the year. We recommended the use of B.t.i. for most applications, with increased dosages during algal blooms (> 1500 cells/ml). The use of temephos in the Orange River should be considered only during algal blooms or when flows exceed 300 m(3)/s. We conclude that helicopter application of larvicides is an effective method of controlling pest blackflies along the middle Orange River.

AB Monodonta labio (Gastropoda: Trochidae) occurs in a wide tidal tone on a boulder-covered shore in Amakusa, Japan. To investigate sources of variation in reproductive output within a population, the fecundity of M. labio was estimated. Regressions of gonad egg counts on shell width were calculated from samples collected bi-weekly at three tidal zones: high, mid and low intertidal. Seasonal fluctuations in the regression revealed that individual females spawn at least three times a year. Variation in fecundity between the three tidal zones was not detected at any time in standard 12 mm snails. Due to the high growth rate in the low zone during the reproductive season, annual fecundity in the low zone was larger than that in the high and mid zones. Thus, tidal zone variation in fecundity of M. labio was a result of growth variation between tidal zones.

AB Under the UN-Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and Bonn Challenge, second-growth forest is promoted as a global solution to climate change, degradation and associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Second growth is often invaded by alien tree species and understanding how this impacts carbon stock and biodiversity recovery is key for restoration planning. We assessed carbon stock and tree diversity recovery in second growth invaded by two Acacia species and non-invaded second growth, with associated edge effects, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Carbon stock recovery in non-invaded forests was threefold lower than in invaded forests. Increasingly isolated, fragmented and deforested areas had low carbon stocks when non-invaded, whereas the opposite was true when invaded. Non-invaded forests recovered threefold to sixfold higher taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity than invaded forest. Higher species turnover and lower nestedness in non-invaded than invaded forests underpinned higher abundance of threatened and endemic species in non-invaded forest. Non-invaded forests presented positive relationships between carbon and biodiversity, whereas in the invaded forests we did not detect any relationship, indicating that more carbon does not equal more biodiversity in landscapes with high vulnerability to invasive acacias. To deliver on combined climate change and biodiversity goals, restoration planning and management must consider biological invasion risk.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

AB In invasion scenarios, native and introduced species co-occur creating new interactions and modifying existing ones. Many plant-plant and plant-insect interactions are mediated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), however, these have seldom been studied in an invasion context. To fill this knowledge gap, we explored some interactions mediated by VOCs between native and introduced plants and insects in a New Zealand system. We investigated whether a native plant, Leptospermum scoparium (manuka), changes its volatile profile when grown adjacent to two European introduced plants, Calluna vulgaris (heather) and Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom), in a semi-field trial using potted plants without above- or below-ground physical contact. We also investigated the influence of plant cues on the host-searching behaviour of two beetles, the native Pyronota festiva (manuka beetle), and the introduced biocontrol agent Lochmaea suturalis (heather beetle), by offering them their host-plant and non-host volatiles versus clean air, and their combination in a Y-tube olfactometer. As a follow-up, we performed preference/feeding tests in Petri dishes with fresh plant material. Results of the semi-field experiment show a significant reduction in green leaf volatiles, sesquiterpenes and total volatile emissions by manuka plants neighbouring heather. In the Y-tube assays, the native beetle P. festiva performed poorly in discriminating between host and non-host plants based on plant volatile cues only. However, it performed relatively well in the Petri dish tests, where other cues (i.e., visual, gustatory or tactile) were present. In contrast, the introduced beetle L. suturalis showed high host-specificity in both Y-tube and Petri dish assays. This study illustrates the importance of VOCs in mediating interactions between introduced and native species, suggesting that invasive plants can disrupt native plants' communication and affect the host-searching behaviour of native insects. It also reinforces the relevance of regular host testing on introduced weed biocontrol agents to avoid unwanted host shifts or host-range expansion.

AB A significant fraction of higher plants in China are threatened due to dramatic landscape transformation and increasing climate change. However, the conservation effectiveness of threatened higher plants (THPs) and their response to climate change are still underexplored to date. Based on the latest list of THPs in China, we obtained 102 593 occurrence records with latitude and longitude for 3858 THPs. By integrating the distribution patterns of three biodiversity indexes (i.e., species richness, species complementarity, and weighted endemism) and 10 plant categories, we identified hotspots for THPs and calculated the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves. We then selected 1959 THPs to project the shift of species richness and range sizes under climate change (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 2.6 and RCP 8.5). In total, 16 hotspot areas covering 7.38% of Chinese land area and containing 91.73% of THPs were identified. Current nature reserves protected 35.05% of hotspots, 73.07% of all THPs, and 56.64% of narrow-ranged species. By the 2070s, the species richness of THPs were predicted to decrease in Southeast and Central China, and 42.42% (RCP 2.6) and 51.40% (RCP 8.5) of the 1959 THPs would confront habitat contraction. Future conservation efforts should focus on the conservation gaps and carry out targeted conservation for THPs with narrow distribution range. In order to cope with climate change, the hotspots with relatively low species loss can serve as important areas to contain current species diversity and the areas with high species gain offer opportunities for ex-situ conservation of THPs.

AB A wide range of community resilience research and projects are motivated by the impacts of catastrophic events in recent decades. Improving community disaster resilience requires enhancing the resilience of multiple systems in a community. This paper reviews the current state-of-the research on disaster risk management for community resilience planning with an emphasis on the interdependent infrastructure systems. Representative community resilience initiatives worldwide are presented first. Then, five most common directions of these initiatives are discussed, including defining resilience concept, assessing resilience quantitatively, modeling infrastructure recovery for resilience assessment, measuring post-disaster infrastructure performance for recovery modeling, and infrastructure disaster risk management decision-making. This review provides an organized overview of the above lines of research based on over 500 articles and reports, identifies some of the research issues and gives recommendations for future work. This study benefits scholars and practitioners who are interested in infrastructure disaster risk management for community resilience planning.

AB The rangelands of Crete island (Greece) are typical Mediterranean habitats under high risk of degradation due to long-term grazing and harsh climatic conditions. We explored the effect of abiotic (climatic conditions, altitude) and biotic factors (long-term grazing by small ruminants) on the floristic composition and diversity of selected lowland (Pyrathi, Faistos) and highland (Vroulidia, Nida) rangelands. In each rangeland, the ground cover was measured, and the floristic composition was calculated in terms of five functional groups: grasses, legumes, forbs, phrygana, and shrubs. The aridity index, species turnover, species richness, Shannon entropy, and Gini-Simpson index (with the latter two converted to the effective number of species) were calculated. Our results reveal that highlands are characterized by the highest aridity index (wetter conditions). Lowland rangelands, compared to highland, exhibited a higher percentage contribution of grasses, legumes, and forbs, while species turnover decreased along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon entropy index was correlated (a) positively with Gini-Simpson and mean annual temperature and (b) negatively with mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and altitude. Moreover, the Gini-Simpson index correlated positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with altitude. Our results could help to understand the effects of grazing on rangeland dynamics and sustainability in semi-arid regions in the context of climatic change.

AB Invasive Acacia species are known to modify soil properties, although effects are often site-specific. We examined the impact of Acacia species on the soils of intact and invaded habitats of two contrasting tropical lowland rain forest types in Brunei Darussalam: heath forest (HF) and mixed dipterocarp forest (MDF). Impacts on soil properties differed between the two forest types. Overall, Acacia-invaded HF soil recorded significantly higher gravimetric water content, pH and total P, K and Ca compared to the intact HF soil. In contrast, invaded MDF soil exhibited significantly higher organic matter content and total soil N, P, K and Mg compared to its intact habitat. Acacia-invaded MDF soils were more nutrient-enriched than Acacia-invaded HF soils by the addition of threefold, threefold and fourfold total soil P, K and Mg, respectively. The positive effect of addition of total soil Ca was, however, fourfold greater in HF soil than MDF soil, indicating that the magnitude of impact on soil properties was strongly site-specific. Overall, Acacia invasion significantly impacted soil properties in nutrient-rich MDF more than those of nutrient-poor HFs, indicating a potential vulnerability of MDFs to invasion.

However, carnivores often make use of coevolutionary strategies which enable them to minimise competition with dominant competitors and thus facilitate coexistence. We used camera trapping and scat analysis to investigate the potential competition between leopards (Panthera pardus) and caracals (Caracal caracal) along spatial, temporal and dietary axes to determine the mechanisms of their coexistence in the Cederberg, South Africa. Our results showed that both carnivores co-occurred at 39.73% of camera trapping sites, but spatial overlap based on Pianka's index was relatively low. We found a high overlap in daily activity patterns between these carnivore species both during winter and summer. Leopards and caracals exhibited fine-scale behavioural avoidance of one another, with time-to-encounters between interspecific competitors being significantly larger compared to intraspecific competitors. The two carnivores had a relatively high diet overlap, although this was largely due to one prey species, namely rock hyrax (Procavia capensis), which appears to be an important shared prey item. However, we did find evidence of dietary niche segregation, as leopards consumed larger prey compared to caracals. Our study suggests that carnivore coexistence in the Cederberg is facilitated by a combination of population-level partitioning in space-use and dietary habits, as well as fine-scale behavioural avoidance at the individual level to reduce interference competition. This study provides insights into the competition and coexistence mechanisms between sympatric carnivores and broadens our understanding of these ecological processes in carnivore guild systems.

AB Aim Organisms on our planet form spatially congruent and functionally distinct communities, which at large geographical scales are called "biomes". Understanding their pattern and function is vital for sustainable use and protection of biodiversity. Current global terrestrial biome classifications are based primarily on climate characteristics and functional aspects of plant community assembly. These and other existing biome schemes do not take account of soil organisms, including highly diverse and functionally important microbial groups. We aimed to define large-scale structure in the diversity of soil microbes (soil microbiomes), pinpoint the environmental drivers shaping it and identify resemblance and mismatch with existing terrestrial biome schemes. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Soil eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Methods We collected soil samples from natural environments world-wide, incorporating most known terrestrial biomes. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize soil biotic communities and k-means clustering to define soil microbiomes describing the diversity of microbial eukaryotic and prokaryotic groups. We used climatic data and soil variables measured in the field to identify the environmental variables shaping soil microbiome structure. Results We recorded strong correlations among fungal, bacterial, archaeal, plant and animal communities, defined a system of global soil microbiomes (producing seven biome types for microbial eukaryotes and six biome types for prokaryotes) and showed that these are typically structured by pH alongside temperature. None of the soil microbiomes are directly paralleled by any current terrestrial biome scheme, with mismatch most substantial for prokaryotes and for microbial eukaryotes in cold climates; nor do they consistently distinguish grassland and forest ecosystems. Main conclusions Existing terrestrial biome classifications represent a limited surrogate for the large-scale diversity patterns of microbial soil organisms. We show that empirically defined soil microbiomes are attainable using metabarcoding and statistical clustering approaches and suggest that they can have wide application in theoretical and applied biodiversity research.

AB Efficient and effective monitoring methods are required to assess population status and gauge efficacy of conservation actions for threatened species. Here we review the spectrum of field methods useful for monitoring distribution, occupancy, abundance, and population trend for the five species of Asian terrestrial bears. Methods reviewed include expert opinion, local knowledge, bear sign, visual observations, camera traps, DNA-based methods (hair and scat derived), and radio telemetry. We examine the application of each method in terms of realizing specific monitoring objectives, their assumptions, challenges, and advantages. Our goal is to assist researchers in matching appropriate field methods with sought-after project objectives and to highlight shortfalls and trade-offs. Methods vary greatly in terms of cost, logistics, required number and expertize of staff, and the reliability of the data they provide. Many Asian bear population assessments have relied on expert opinion, local interviews, and sign surveys to provide estimates of distribution, abundance, and trend, in part because these are inexpensive and relatively easy to employ. However, increasing use of camera traps and DNA-based methods now allow for better monitoring via occupancy or rigorous capture-recapture population estimation, with the caveat that these methods may be restricted by inadequate budgets or logistical constraints. For distribution monitoring, camera traps and DNA yield the most definitive records of presence, but in low density bear populations, sign and local knowledge may be more effective. For occupancy, camera traps and DNA are advantageous in providing definitive detections in known time periods. For abundance/density or population trend monitoring in relatively small areas (<10,000 km(2)), bears must be individually identified and used in a mark-recapture design. This requires DNA from collections of hair or scat, or a camera-based survey in which natural chest marks are clearly visible and individually distinguishable. DNA-methods or camera traps within individual identification is best for population trend when sufficient funding is available. Alternatively, careful use of local knowledge or expert opinion may be viable options, but come with greater uncertainty. For the foreseeable future, we believe that expert opinion will likely continue to play a large part in monitoring Asian bears, but these opinions should be informed by more rigorous data from the other methods we discuss.

AB The current environmental changes stressing the Earth's biological systems urgently require study from an integrated perspective to reveal unexpected, cross-scale interactions, particularly between microbes and macroscale phenomena. Such interactions are the basis of a mechanistic understanding of the important connections between deforestation and emerging infectious disease, feedback between ecosystem disturbance and the gut microbiome, and the cross-scale effects of environmental pollutants. These kinds of questions can be answered with existing techniques and data, but a concerted effort is necessary to better coordinate studies and data sets from different disciplines to fully leverage their potential.

AB Privately protected areas (PPAs) are internationally considered to be important policy implementation instruments to augment and strengthen protected area networks. However, there has been limited reflection on the performance of PPAs over time. This paper aims to identify key risks to the performance of PPAs as policy implementation instruments through the application of Theory of Change (ToC). Identifying and understanding these risks are important to allow for the evaluation and monitoring of PPA performance. The ToC method was applied to a specific PPA policy instrument namely, private nature reserves (PNRs) in the South African context. The research results produced 29 key assumptions translated into 29 key risks. These risk are critically discussed against existing South African and international literature. To test and refine the risks further it is recommended that they be applied to PPA case studies in different contexts.

AB Extreme climatic events are considered one of the main consequences of climate change. In the Pampas region, Argentina, an intensification of rainfall is expected during the periods of maximum agrochemical application. This study assesses the main factors determining the zooplankton community attributes in three streams belonging to the agricultural Pampas region, Argentina, and the effect of rainfall and seasonal crop practices on the zooplankton community composition. Sampling campaigns were performed before and after three rainfall events during two seasonal crop practices: (1) soybean chemical fallow-sowing and corn vegetative growth-flowering, (2) soybean vegetative growth-grain filling and corn sowing. The runoff in agricultural areas affected the zooplankton community attributes and composition. The biological oxygen demand, turbidity, and conductivity were the main water quality variables affecting the zooplankton community attributes. The increase of these variables after rainfall or during pre-emergence crop practices favoured the zooplankton groups most tolerant to eutrophication such as Bdelloidea, Chydoridae, Moinidae, and Sididae. Factors such as rainfall and seasonal crop practices must be considered in environmental monitoring design.

AB Aims Fertiliser is often used to kick-start ecological restoration despite growing evidence of the potentially negative impacts on plant diversity. Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest species growing on nutrient (especially phosphorus) impoverished soils in southwestern Australia have a suite of adaptations for phosphorus (P) acquisition, including the formation of cluster roots, and associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Here we investigated how escalating P supply, along with a stoichiometric adjustment of nitrogen (N) supply, impacted the growth and nutrition of a wide range of jarrah forest seedlings. Methods In a pot experiment, we measured seedling biomass and nutritional responses of 12 jarrah forest species to a gradient of P supply in relation to N supply, and for the mycorrhizal species, inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Results Three cluster-root forming species did not respond to increasing P, probably because they were reliant on seed P. Generally, mycorrhizal species showed a positive biomass response to increasing P when N was available. Mycorrhizas benefited seedling growth at low P (9 mg P added per kg of jarrah forest soil) when N was also available, and were parasitic to seedling growth at high P (243 mg P/ kg soil) without additional N. Conclusions These results highlight importance of P and N supply in determining the nature of the symbiosis between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. Since P supply has the potential to reduce plant growth, for a range of species, our results suggest careful consideration of fertiliser amounts for ecological restoration of ecosystems adapted to nutrient poor soils.

AB Experimental approaches are often used to better understand the mechanisms behind and consequences of post-mortem alteration on proxies for diet reconstruction. Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is such a dietary proxy, using dental wear features in extant and extinct taxa to reconstruct feeding behaviour and mechanical food properties. In fossil specimens especially, DMTA can be biased by post-mortem alteration caused by mechanical or chemical alteration of the enamel surface. Here we performed three different dental surface alteration experiments to assess the effect of common taphonomic processes by simplifying them: (1) tumbling in sediment suspension to simulate fluvial transport, (2) sandblasting to simulate mechanical erosion due to aeolian sediment transport, (3) acid etching to simulate chemical dissolution by stomach acid. For tumbling (1) we found alteration to be mainly dependent on sediment grain size fraction and that on specimens tumbled with sand fractions mainly post-mortem scratches formed on the dental surface, while specimens tumbled with a fine-gravel fraction showed post-mortem formed dales. Sandblasting (2) with loess caused only negligible alteration, however blasting with fine sand quartz particles resulted in significant destruction of enamel surfaces and formation of large post-mortem dales. Acid etching (3) using diluted hydrochloric acid solutions in concentrations similar to that of predator stomachs led to a complete etching of the whole dental surface, which did not resemble those of teeth recovered from owl pellets. The experiments resulted in post-mortem alteration comparable, but not identical to naturally occurring post-mortem alteration features. Nevertheless, this study serves as a first assessment and step towards further, more refined taphonomic experiments evaluating post-mortem alteration of dental microwear texture (DMT).

AB When in 2010 the world's governments pledged to increase protected area coverage to 17% of the world's land surface, several Central African countries had already set aside 25% of their northern savannas for conservation. To evaluate the effectiveness of this commitment, we analyzed the results of 68 multispecies surveys conducted in the seven main savanna national parks in Central Africa (1960-2017). We also assembled information on potential drivers of large herbivore population trends (rainfall and number of rangers) and on tourist numbers and revenues. In six out of the seven parks, wild large herbivore populations declined dramatically over time, livestock numbers increased severalfold, and tourism, the pillar under a once thriving local wildlife industry, collapsed. Zakouma National Park (Chad) stood out because its large herbivore populations increased, an increase that was positively correlated with rainfall and number of rangers (a proxy for management inputs). With increasing insecurity and declining revenues, governments find themselves confronted with too few resources to protect vast areas. To deal with this conversation overstretch, we propose to extend the repeatedly promoted solutions--scaled up funding, enhanced management--with a strategic retreat, focusing scarce resources on smaller areas to save wildlife in the Central African savannas.

AB Traditional assumptions that wildlife hunting and consumption vary according to local economic development underlie most efforts to engage tropical forest communities in wildlife conservation, but these assumptions are insufficient for explaining many examples of non-economic and non-subsistence hunting around the world. Thus, there is a recognized need for conservation scien-tists/practitioners to understand the social and cultural factors governing wildlife hunting and consumption. We contribute to filling a gap in understanding how local culture and, specifically, social norms influence wildlife use and in what ways they could augment economic development models for explaining behavior. We studied illegal wild bird hunting among five villages of Indigenous Dai rubber farmers near Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve in southwest China, a tropical biodiversity hotspot experiencing defaunation and persistent hunting pressure. Our analyses relied on interviews with nine key informants, four months of ethnographic observation, 120 anonymous self-administered questionnaires and 176 in-person structured surveys. We found that monetary income and nutritional subsistence could not explain most wild bird hunting and consumption. Instead, bird hunting was primarily predicted by cultural preferences for recreation and the desire to consume wild bird meat, and wild bird meat consumption was primarily pre-dicted by cultural preferences for its taste. Social norms were central to the persistence of wild bird hunting; significantly predicting wild bird hunting, rewarding skilled hunters with social affirmation, discouraging cooperation with law enforcement, and discouraging efforts to reduce bird consumption. Cultural factors such as folk stories, village history, and ethnic identity un-dergird positive attitudes toward hunting. Our findings suggest that through its manifestation in social norms, local culture can influence wildlife hunting and consumption in ways unexplained by rational economic maximization. We discuss the implications of social norms for how common behavioral change strategies (i.e. legislation, governance, and community outreach) may or may not alter wildlife hunting and consumption. Importantly, our findings suggest that changing wildlife use necessarily involves cultural and social change, meaning that wildlife conservation practitioners must cautiously consider the cultural and social values associated with wildlife when deciding whether or how to engage communities in wildlife hunting interventions.

AB In savanna ecosystems, tree canopy patches differ in plant species composition compared to adjacent intercanopy spaces due to different levels of resource availabilities. Mistletoes further augment nutrients underneath tree canopies whilst reducing their hosts' competitive edge, thus providing more resources and creating patches that support higher understory species richness. However, little is known on how understory species and functional trait assemblages, in both canopy and intercanopy spaces, are affected by varying overstory mistletoe infection intensities. This study investigated how functional and species diversity/composition varied within and between canopy patches and intercanopy spaces of high- and low mistletoe-infected Vachellia karroo trees. The affinity of individual species to the different canopy patches and intercanopy spaces was also assessed. Microhabitats had significantly different species compositions. A higher proportion of species (34%) showed a strong positive affinity towards canopy patches whilst intercanopy spaces were strongly associated with only 9% of recorded species, indicating greater dominance of some species there. Generally, subcanopy patches had significantly higher species richness and diversity, and functional diversity, compared to adjacent intercanopy spaces. These variables increased with increasing mistletoe infection, thus grass, forb and tree species diversity were 17-43% higher, and functional diversity indices were 0.5-28% greater in high- compared to low mistletoe-infection canopy patches. Furthermore, species richness and diversity of C3, C4, annual and perennial plants were 1.27-3.13-fold higher within canopy patches compared to intercanopy spaces and 1.28-1.74-fold greater within high- compared to low mistletoe-infection microhabitats. Consequently, high mistletoe-infection canopy patches had between 1.08 and 3.76-fold greater species richness and diversity of C3, C4, annual and perennial plants compared to the other three microhabitats. Our findings suggest that by enhancing spatial heterogeneity, variations in mistletoe infection facilitate biodiversity and to a lesser extent vegetation structural diversity in these semi-arid savannas.

AB Analyses of faunal remains are a key means of inferring palaeoenvironmental change. in this paper, the use of faunal remains as a proxy for environmental conditions from Marine Isotope Stage 6 to the Holocene in southern Africa is reviewed. The focus of this review is on large herbivore abundance and how these fluctuate temporally and regionally in accordance with palaeo-climatic shifts. Here, southern Africa is divided into four eco-regions loosely based on climatic, biotic and zoogeographic traits: the Cape Floristic Region, the arid and semi-arid region, the savanna and grassland region, and the wetter eastern region. The relative abundance of large herbivores within these regions are noted, and temporal trends are inferred. On the whole, most eco-regions maintain similar herbivore compositions over time showing the regional ecological resilience of these taxa to local-scale environmental change. Yet some changes in faunal frequencies are apparent. The Cape Floristic Region shows evidence of significant faunal turnover from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Here, grazers are significantly more abundant during glacial periods, probably linked to the terrestrial expansion of the palaeo-Agulhas coastal plain. Shifts in ungulate abundance in the currently xeric central interior, also indicate wetter periods in the Pleistocene. Holocene faunas are generally similar to historic distributions but shifts between xeric and mesic periods are also evident.

AB The relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species diversity has been one of the most studied patterns in ecology. However, some taxa and regions worldwide still lack studies to verify this relationship. Phyllostomidae is the most ecologically diverse family of mammals worldwide, encompassing a great proportion of the species of mammals and bats across the Amazon forest. Even though the Amazon seems to be a homogeneous landscape with an unlimited supply of water, it presents a high variation in vegetation types and proximity to large bodies of water. In our study, we have analyzed the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and proximity to large bodies of water in the structure of phyllostomid assemblages (Chao-estimated species richness and capture rates). We have found that an increase in landscape heterogeneity associated with large bodies of water and representative flooded forest increase species richness. In addition, more heterogeneous landscapes in the presence of water have presented a higher abundance of bats. Our findings might be related with the small niche widths of phyllostomids, which could have promoted specialization in some landscape features, while the presence of water could have promoted an increase in food availability (insects and fruits), leading to an increase in phyllostomid richness and abundance. This is important information for planning where to place protected areas in the northeastern portion of the Amazon, while taking into account the consequences of drought and deforestation close to water bodies on the local phyllostomid fauna, and the maintenance of the ecosystem services provided by a higher bat diversity.

AB Purpose The main components of resiliency, including resilience capacities, resilience activities and resilience measures, are identified, extracted and redefined by designing their ontologies. The integrated model is developed by adapting the PDCA (plan, do, check and act) model to resilience management and implementing the developed concepts in the model. Design/methodology/approach This study uses systems theory to define the main concepts discussed in the literature on resilience. This study then uses systems engineering theory and a resource-based view of the firm to develop an integrated framework to demonstrate how a resilient firm operates. Findings The revised terminologies and the integrated model address the current theoretical issues in the literature, and they also provide a reference model for practical implementation of resilience management at the firm level. Also, the integrated model addresses the role of innovation in resilience management. Originality/value The study examines the concept of resilience form a quality perspective and also examines how resilience and innovation are related.

AB Species niches have been defined in different ways, variably encompassing abiotic and biotic parameters limiting an organism's spatial distribution. Climate is often the primary component of the abiotic (fundamental) niche, especially among terrestrial plants. In invasion biology, there is an ongoing debate on the prevalence of niche shifts, which may be linked to divergent traits in a species' native and invaded ranges, as well as dispersal limitations and invasion lag phases. Using a global dataset, we tested whether shifts occurred in the invader Johnsongrass (Sorghum hale-pense), which has undergone intercontinental spread as well as habitat-switching within its invaded range in North America. Climate space ordination showed that North America is, on average, colder than Afro-Eurasia, and North American Johnsongrass occupies wetter environ-ments than in its native range. Within North America, both agricultural and non-agricultural ecotypes shifted slightly toward colder climates. Notably, while non-agricultural populations far outnumber agricultural ones, the former occupy a narrower niche (DM = 42.7 +/- 0.8) than the latter (DM = 59.3 +/- 1.1), implying agriculture's role in providing suitable environments in otherwise suboptimal climates. Maximum entropy models of agricultural and non-agricultural North American populations showed limited ecotypic differences in current suitability and range expansion under climate change through the rest of this century. We also predicted climatic suitability for Johnsongrass to increase most in the Upper Midwest and Great Plains by 2100. Our results help contextualize the empirical evidence for ecotypic differentiation in Johnsongrass, as well predict future range expansion and damage niches.

AB 1. There is an increasing interest in landscape-scale perspectives of ecosystem functioning to inform policy and conservation decisions. However, we need a better understanding of the stability of ecosystem functioning (e.g. plant productivity) at the landscape scale to inform policy around topics such as global food security.
   2. We investigate the role of the ecological and environmental context on landscape-scale stability of plant productivity in agricultural pasture using remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index data. We determine whether four measures of stability (variability, magnitude of extreme anomalies, recovery time and recovery rate) are predicted by (a) species richness of vascular plants, (b) regional land cover heterogeneity and (c) climatic history.
   3. Stability of plant productivity was primarily associated with climatic history, particularly a history of extreme events. These effects outweighed any positive effects of species richness in the agricultural landscape.
   4. A history of variable and extreme climates both increased and decreased contemporary ecosystem stability, suggesting both cumulative and legacy effects, whereas land cover heterogeneity had no effect on stability.
   5. The landscape scale is a relevant spatial scale for the management of an ecosystem's stability. At this scale, we find that past climate is a stronger driver of stability in plant productivity than species richness, differing from results at finer field scales. Management should take an integrated approach by incorporating the environmental context of the landscape, such as its climatic history, and consider multiple components of stability to maintain functioning in landscapes that are particularly vulnerable to environmental change.

AB Holothurians are marine invertebrates that are among the most widespread benthic megafauna communities by both biomass and abundance in shallow-water and deep-sea ecosystems, their functions supporting important ecological services worldwide. Despite their simple appearance as sea cucumbers, holothurians show a wide range of feeding practices. However, information on what and how these animals eat is scattered and potentially confusing. We provide a comprehensive review of holothurian nutrition in coastal and deep-sea ecosystems. First, we describe morphological aspects of holothurian feeding and the ultrastructure of tentacles. We discuss the two processes for food capture, concluding that mucus adhesion is likely the main method; two mucous cells, type-1 and type-2, possibly allow the adhesion and de-adhesion, respectively, of food particles. Secondly, this review aims to clarify behavioural aspects of holothurian suspension- and deposit-feeding. We discuss the daily feeding cycle, and selective feeding strategies. We conclude that there is selectivity for fine and organically rich particles, and that feeding through the cloaca is also a route for nutrient absorption. Third, we provide a wide description of the diet of holothurians, which can be split into two categories: living and non-living material. We suggest that Synallactida, Molpadida, Persiculida, Holothuriida and Elasipodida, ingest the same fractions, and emphasise the importance of bacteria in the diet of holothurians.

AB In this study, we investigate the main ecological interactions between fouling aquatic organisms (both invasive and native) present in the reservoir of the Governador Jose Richa hydroelectric plant, located in southern Brazil, and to identify the most suitable period for the interruption of machinery operation for cleaning and maintenance of the hydraulic systems of this plant. A total of 32 experimental plates were fixed to a metallic structure positioned close to the plant's water intake. Three species of invasive fouling were identified in our samples (Limnoperna fortunei [Mollusca], Cordylophora sp., and Hydra sp. [Cnidaria]) and six native taxa belonging to the phyla Protozoa, Ciliophora, Amoebozoa, and Arthropoda. Spring and summer were the seasons with the highest fouling rates, as well as densities of fouling organisms. The highest levels of diversity were recorded during the colder seasons. Several interactions between the organisms were identified, such as mutualism, commensalism, competition, epibiosis, cannibalism, and predation. The data obtained suggest that, from the biological point of view, the most suitable period for machine shutdown destined for the removal of biological fouling in the hydraulic systems of the studied plant is between the end of spring and the beginning of summer.

AB This study determined the carcass yields of red hartebeest from Namibia and compared the physical-chemical meat quality characteristics of six different muscles (biceps femoris, infraspinatus, longissimus thoracis et lumborum, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and supraspinatus) for both males and females. Red hartebeest males were heavier (133.92 kg) than females (114.20 kg) but the average dressing percentage did not differ between the two sexes. Muscles from females had a lower mean shear force value of 3.59 kg/1.27 cm o, compared to males (4.23 kg/1.27 cm o). The most tender muscle was the infraspinatus of the female treatment group, while the semimembranosus of the male treatment group was the least tender muscle. Drip loss, cooking loss and L* (lightness) values were not affected by sex. The largest hue angle was observed in the semitendinosus muscle of the female treatment group (28.94 & DEG;), and it was thus the lightest red muscle. The highest chroma values (17.3) were observed in the semimembranosus muscle. Muscle protein content averaged 20.5% over all treatment combinations, and the mean intra-muscular fat content for both male and female muscles was low (2.4%). The shoulder muscles, infraspinatus and supraspinatus, of the females had the highest fat content (2.7%). The results indicate that red hartebeest meat should be market according to specific muscles and that sex of the animals need not be considered during marketing.</p>

AB Invasive mammalian herbivores can have significant unwanted impacts on indigenous ecosystems and production landscapes. Their impacts are often mitigated using sustained lethal control or eradication. If eradication is the chosen option, it is critical to confirm where the pest population is distributed and prove that eradication has been achieved following the removal intervention. This form of pest management requires robust and quantitative estimates of surveillance. We compared the detection probabilities, derived surveillance system sensitivities (under standardized conditions), and cost of surveillance for four survey methods for invasive Bennett's wallabies (Notamacropus rufogriseus) in South Island, New Zealand: helicopter surveys with observers, helicopter surveys using a thermal imaging camera, a ground hunter with detector dogs, and camera traps. We found camera traps and ground hunters with dogs were the most sensitive surveillance methods (82% and 45% chance of detecting a wallaby assuming full search coverage of a 100-ha area, respectively) and were most cost-effective (62% and 85% cheaper than helicopter surveys with observers, respectively). However, although these methods are useful for surveying small areas (similar to 1000 ha or less), capacity and time issues make them impractical for surveying large areas. The helicopter-based methods will likely be more suitable for monitoring large areas (e.g., 10,000-50,000 ha) that need to be completed more rapidly than could be achieved using ground-based methods. The model that we used for evaluating detection probability and surveillance sensitivity for different survey methods is highly applicable for managing a wide range of mammalian pests and confidently declaring their absence from an area.

AB Conservation of large carnivores such as leopards requires large and interconnected habitats. Despite the wide geographic range of the leopard globally, only 17% of their habitat is within protected areas. Leopards are widely distributed in Nepal, but their population status and occupancy are poorly understood. We carried out the sign-based leopard occupancy survey across the entire Chure range (similar to 19,000 km(2)) to understand the habitat occupancy along with the covariates affecting their occupancy. Leopard signs were obtained from in 70 out of 223 grids surveyed, with a naive leopard occupancy of 0.31. The model-averaged leopard occupancy was estimated to be 0.5732 (SE 0.0082) with a replication-level detection probability of 0.2554 (SE 0.1142). The top model shows the additive effect of wild boar, ruggedness, presence of livestock, and human population density positively affecting the leopard occupancy. The detection probability of leopard was higher outside the protected areas, less in the high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) areas, and higher in the areas with livestock presence. The presence of wild boar was strong predictor of leopard occupancy followed by the presence of livestock, ruggedness, and human population density. Leopard occupancy was higher in west Chure (0.70 +/- SE 0.047) having five protected areas compared with east Chure (0.46 +/- SE 0.043) with no protected areas. Protected areas and prey species had positive influence on leopard occupancy in west Chure range. Similarly in the east Chure, the leopard occupancy increased with prey, NDVI, and terrain ruggedness. Enhanced law enforcement and mass awareness activities are necessary to reduce poaching/killing of wild ungulates and leopards in the Chure range to increase leopard occupancy. In addition, maintaining the sufficient natural prey base can contribute to minimize the livestock depredation and hence decrease the human-leopard conflict in the Chure range.

AB Over the past decade, trophy hunting in Africa has seen increased public and scientific interest. Much of that attention has come from outside of Africa, with little emphasis on local views. We circulated an online survey through international networks to explore demographic and regional differences in opinion regards support for African trophy hunting, trophy import bans, and outside funding of conservation estates supported by hunting. We received similar to 5700 responses and found that location, demography, and conservation background influenced opinion. African and North American respondents showed (significantly) more support for trophy hunting than respondents from Europe or other areas, as did respondents with conservation backgrounds. Unlike North Americans, Africans supported external subsidies of wildlife areas presently funded by hunting. Many factors affected opinions on African hunting, but respondent location played a major role. Realistic policy on African trophy hunting should thus integrate African perspectives, in particular those of rural communities.

AB Background The growing human population around the world is creating an increased demand for food. In agricultural landscapes, forests are cleared and turned into agricultural land to produce more food. Increasing the productivity of agricultural land per unit area may prevent extreme forest degradation. Since many agricultural products are dependent on pollinators, it is possible to increase crop production by increasing the pollination rate in the agricultural landscapes. Pollinators are highly dependent on forest patches in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, by creating new forest patches around agricultural fields, we can increase the pollination rate, and thus the crop production. In this regard, estimating the effects of different scenarios of forest fragmentation helps us to find an optimized pattern of forest patches for increasing pollination in an agricultural landscape. Methods To investigate the effect of different forest fragmentation scenarios on pollination, we used simulated agricultural landscapes, including different forest proportions and degrees of fragmentation. Using landscape metrics, we estimated the relationship between pollination and landscape structure for each landscape. Results Our results showed that for increasing pollination, two significant factors should be considered: habitat amount and capacity of small patches to supply pollination. We found that when the capacity of small patches in supplying pollination was low, fragmented patterns of forest patches decreased pollination. With increasing capacity, landscapes with a high degree of forest fragmentation showed the highest levels of pollination. There was an exception for habitat amounts (the proportion of forest patches) less than 0.1 of the entire landscape where increasing edge density, aggregation, and the number of forest patches resulted in increasing pollination in all scenarios. Conclusion This study encourages agriculturists and landscape planners to focus on increasing crop production per unit area by pollinators because it leads to biodiversity conservation and reduces socio-economic costs of land-use changes. We also suggest that to increase pollination in agricultural landscapes by creating new forest patches, special attention should be paid to the capacity of patches in supporting pollinators.

AB Ailanthus altissima is one of the worst invasive plants in Europe in several habitat types, including high-biodiversity grasslands. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of the invasive A. altissima on high-biodiversity grassland vegetation and the effects of its removal on the recovery of native plant communities. The study area was within the Alta Murgia National Park (SE Italy). Seventeen vegetation quadrats were sampled in invaded grasslands and nine quadrats were sampled in nearby uninvaded areas. A. altissima was removed from six quadrats, which were sampled for two years after plant removal. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination were used to identify and visualize the general vegetation pattern. Generalised Linear Models with different error structures were used to analyse the effects of A. altissima on native grasslands and vegetation recovery after removal. Results showed that the invasion of A. altissima changed drastically the community composition, reduced plant richness and diversity. Invaded stands had a greater presence of ruderal and widely distributed taxa, as opposed to a lesser presence of endemic and Mediterranean ones. The differences in the community composition between invaded and uninvaded quadrats became clearly detectable when A. altissima plants exceeded a threshold of 1 m of height and 50% of coverage.

TI Derived woodiness and annual habit evolved in African umbellifers as

AB Background One of the major trends in angiosperm evolution was the shift from woody to herbaceous habit. However, reversals known as derived woodiness have also been reported in numerous, distantly related clades. Among theories evoked to explain the factors promoting the evolution of derived woodiness are moderate climate theory and cavitation theory. The first assumes that woody habit evolves in response to mild climate allowing for prolonged life span, which in turn leads to bigger and woodier bodies. The second sees woodiness as a result of natural selection for higher cavitation resistance in seasonally dry environments. Here, we compare climatic niches of woody and herbaceous, mostly southern African, umbellifers from the Lefebvrea clade to assess whether woody taxa in fact occur in markedly drier habitats. We also calibrate their phylogeny to estimate when derived woodiness evolved. Finally, we describe the wood anatomy of selected woody and herbaceous taxa to see if life forms are linked to any particular wood traits. Results The evolution of derived woodiness in chamaephytes and phanerophytes as well as the shifts to short-lived annual therophytes in the Lefebvrea clade took place at roughly the same time: in the Late Miocene during a trend of global climate aridification. Climatic niches of woody and herbaceous genera from the Cape Floristic Region overlap. There are only two genera with distinctly different climatic preferences: they are herbaceous and occur outside of the Cape Floristic Region. Therefore, studied herbs have an overall climatic niche wider than their woody cousins. Woody and herbaceous species do not differ in qualitative wood anatomy, which is more affected by stem architecture and, probably, reproductive strategy than by habit. Conclusions Palaeodrought was likely a stimulus for the evolution of derived woodiness in the Lefebvrea clade, supporting the cavitation theory. The concurrent evolution of short-lived annuals withering before summer exemplifies an alternative solution to the same problem of drought-induced cavitation. Changes of the life form were most likely neither spurred nor precluded by any qualitative wood traits, which in turn are more affected by internode length and probably also reproductive strategy.

AB Single invaders often substantially alter ecosystems, but the potential impacts by multiple invaders remain understudied. The golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) and the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) are two widespread coinvaders. To test the effects of co-occurrence of the two species on a clear-water macrophyte state, we performed a 20-day experiment in 16 mesocosms (4 contained only two snails, 4 contained only two crayfishes, 4 contained two snails and two crayfishes, and 4 controls). Comparing with the control, the leaf length, number, and biomass of Vallisneria denseserrulata had decreased in the snail-only and crayfish-only treatments. In the crayfish-only treatment, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids had increased compared with the control, while they did not differ between the snail-only and the control treatment. Nutrients and turbidity concentrations did not differ between the snail + crayfish and the crayfish-only treatment, and plant biomass did not differ between the snail + crayfish and the snail-only treatment. These findings suggest that golden apple snails mainly affected the lake ecosystem by plant grazing, while red swamp crayfishes disturbed the sediment by increasing nutrients in the water and through resuspension. These snail and crayfish together had mainly additive effects on macrophyte and the physico-chemical variables studied.

AB Water sources in arid and semiarid ecosystems support humans, wildlife, and domestic animals, forming nodes of activity that sculpt surrounding plant communities and impact critical grazing and soil systems. However, global aridification and changing surface water supply threaten to disrupt these water resources, with strong implications for conservation and management of these ecosystems. To understand how effects of herbivore aggregation at water impact plant communities across contexts, we measured herbivore activity, plant height, cover (trees, grasses, forbs, and bare ground), diversity, and composition at 17 paired water sources and matrix sites across a range of abiotic factors in a semiarid savanna in Kenya. The effects of proximity to surface water and herbivore aggregation on plant communities varied substantially depending on soil and rainfall. In arid areas with nutrient-poor sandy soils, forb and tree cover were 50% lower at water sources compared to neighboring matrix sites, bare ground was 20% higher, species richness was 15% lower, and a single globally important grazing grass (Cynodon dactylon) dominated 60% of transects. However, in mesic areas with nutrient-rich finely textured soils, species richness was 25% higher, despite a 40% increase in bare ground, concurrent with the decline of a dominant tall grass (Themeda triandra) and increase in C. dactylon and other grass species near water sources. Recent rainfall was important for grasses; cover was higher relative to matrix sites only during wet periods, a potential indication of compensatory grazing. These findings suggest that effects of herbivore aggregation on vegetation diversity and composition will vary in magnitude, and in some cases direction, depending on other factors at the site. Where moisture and nutrient resources are high and promote the dominance of few plant species, herbivore aggregations may maintain diversity by promoting grazing lawns and increasing nondominant species cover. However, in arid conditions and sites with low nutrient availability, diversity can be substantially reduced by these aggregations. Our results highlight the importance of considering abiotic conditions when managing for effects of herbivore aggregations near water. This will be particularly important for future managers in light of growing global aridification and surface water changes.

AB In line with general biodiversity losses across agricultural landscapes, insect pollinators have experienced recent sharp declines. A range of conservation measures have been developed to address these declines, with plant pollinator interaction networks providing key insights into the effectiveness of these measures. For the first time, we studied interactions between three diurnal pollinator groups (bees, hoverflies, and butterflies) and insect-pollinated plants to understand how they are affected by pond management and restoration. Major network contributors were identified, and important network-level parameters compared at nine farmland ponds under different management strategies to assess management effects on plant-pollinator interactions: three 'overgrown' tree-covered ponds, three 'long-term managed ponds' kept in an open-canopy, early-to mid successional state by periodic interventions involving tree and sediment removal, and three 'recently restored ponds', initially heavily overgrown with woody vegetation, and subsequently rapidly transformed into an early succession state through major tree and sediment removal. Interaction complexity, as measured by the metrics 'links per species', 'linkage density', Fisher's alpha and Shannon's Diversity, was higher for both long-term managed and recently restored ponds compared to overgrown ponds. Several network-level parameters indicated that highest complexity levels were found at recently restored ponds due to their substantially higher plant diversity. Bipartite interaction analysis suggests major benefits of pond management and restoration for agricultural pollinator assemblages. We strongly advocate the inclusion of ponds in conservation strategies and policies aimed at pollinators ponds should be part of the pollinator pantry.

AB The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is globally recognized as a hotspot of plant diversity and endemism. Much of this diversity stems from radiations associated with infertile acid sands derived from sandstones of the geologically ancient Cape Fold Belt. These ancient montane floras acted as the source for most subsequent radiations on the Cape lowlands during the Oligocene (on silcretes) and Mio-Pliocene (on shales). The geomorphic evolution of the CFR during the Plio-Pleistocene led to the first large-scale occurrence of calcareous substrata (coastal dunes and calcarenites) along the Cape coast, providing novel habitats for plant colonization and ensuing evolution of the Cape coastal flora-the most recent diversification event in the Cape. Few studies have investigated the CFR's dune and calcarenite floras, and fewer still have done so in an evolutionary context. Here, we present a unified flora of these coastal calcareous habitats of the CFR and analyze the taxonomic, biological and geographical traits of its component species to gain insights into its assembly. The Cape coastal flora, comprising 1,365 species, is taxonomically dominated by the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Iridaceae, with Erica, Aspalathus and Agathosma being the most speciose genera. In terms of growth-form mix, there is a roughly equal split between herbaceous and woody species, the former dominated by geophytes and forbs, the latter by dwarf and low shrubs. Species associated with the Fynbos biome constitute the bulk of the flora, while the Subtropical Thicket and Wetland biomes also house a substantial number of species. The Cape coastal flora is a distinctly southern African assemblage, with 61% of species belonging to southern African lineages (including 35% of species with Cape affinity) and 59% being endemic to the CFR. Unique among floras from the Cape and coastal Mediterranean-climate regions is the relatively high proportion of species associated with tropical lineages, several of which are restricted to calcareous substrata of the CFR. The endemic, calcicolous component of the flora, constituting 40% of species, represents 6% of the Cape's regional plant diversity-high tallies compared to other biodiversity hotspots. Most coastal-flora endemics emerged during the Plio-Pleistocene as a product of ecological speciation upon the colonization of calcareous substrata, with the calcifugous fynbos floras of montane acid substrata being the most significant source of this diversification, especially on the typically shallow soils of calcarenite landscapes. On the other hand, renosterveld floras, associated with edaphically benign soils that are widespread on the CFR lowlands, have not been a major source of lineages to the coastal flora. Our findings suggest that, over and above the strong pH gradient that exists on calcareous substrata, soil depth and texture may act as important edaphic filters to incorporating lineages from floras on juxtaposed substrata in the CFR.

AB Exotic pests have caused huge losses to agriculture, forestry, and human health. Analyzing information on all concerned pest species and their origin will help to improve the inspection procedures and will help to clarify the relative risks of imported cargo and formulate international trade policies. Records of intercepted pests from wood packaging materials (WPM) from 2003 to 2016 in the China Port Information Network (CPIN) database were analyzed. Results showed that the number of intercepted pests from WPM was lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth one. The total number of interceptions increased each year, with 53.33% of intercepted insects followed by nematodes (31.54%). The original continent of most intercepted pests was Asia (49.29%). Xylophagous insects were primarily intercepted from Southeast Asian countries, whereas nematodes were primarily intercepted from Korea, Australia, Mexico, and other countries. WPM interception records were mainly concentrated in China's coastal inspection stations (98.7%), with the largest number of interceptions documented in Shanghai, followed by the inspection stations of Jiangsu Province. The proportion of pest taxa intercepted by the Chinese provinces' stations each year is becoming increasingly balanced. The number of pest disposal treatment measures for intercepted cargoes with dead non-quarantine pests increased significantly from 2012 to 2016. This reflects the fact that Chinese customs inspection stations are becoming increasingly scientific and standardizing the interception and treatment of WPM pests. The issues reflected in the database, with a view to providing a reference for future work by customs officers and researchers.

AB The Gamka Karoo is a low-lying vegetation type in the semi-arid Nama Karoo in the south-western part of South Africa with extensive rangelands used for livestock ranching and wildlife. Although the Nama Karoo is generally resilient to grazing and most responsive to variable rainfall, chronic overstocking, particularly in the driest regions and around water points, could degrade vegetation and soils. The interactive effects of rainfall (MAP) and grazing (stocking rate, percentage overstocking, resting system) on plant species composition and soil chemical characteristics were examined on 36 farms across a regional rainfall gradient (120-300 mm y(-1)) and around water points (n = 3) on farms. Multivariate direct gradient analyses revealed regional species compositional differences were related most strongly to MAP (r = 0.736), but not to grazing, with no MAP x grazing interaction. On a smaller scale, grazing intensity (1/distance from water point) had a weak negative impact on the vegetation (r = 0.36) and soil chemistry (r = 0.49) with nutrient enrichment around water points in paddocks. Our findings suggest that the Karoo is responsive to rainfall, but loosely coupled to grazing. Adaptive management with livestock numbers matched to rainfall and forage supply is recommended to sustain animal production, vegetation and soils.

AB To estimate the effect of browsing on the mountain range of the Sierra de San Francisco, Mexico, we assessed browse species richness and canopy cover and the relative abundance of goats (large flocks), cattle, sheep, and equids (small herds) across 2700 m from pens used to milk goats in 1 lowland and 2 upland mesas, which differ in the sarcocaulescent shrublands that inhabit there. Also, we evaluated the relation between browse species preference by domestic herbivores and their canopy cover. Small ruminants (mainly goats), not cattle and equids, had a greater relative abundance near milking pens and, even more, far from them, which was observed as a ditch-shaped pattern across the distance. Goats did not affect browse species richness across the distance, but they affected the total canopy cover; sites with greater goat relative abundance had less total canopy cover, which was observed as a hump-shaped pattern. Preferred and non-preferred browse species by goats showed increasing and hump pattern across distance. Non-preferred species also showed decreasing and U-shaped patterns. Thus, goats have created trends in browse species canopy cover, stressing the hump pattern in the total canopy cover in lowland and upland sarcocaulescent shrublands.

AB Early growth performances of 11 native tree species were investigated in three different sites in Mindanao, Philippines, to evaluate their adaptability and potential for plantation development. Three alien species were added to assess how native species could potentially compete with these alien species based on survival rate, diameter growth rate (DGR), and height growth rate (HGR). A year after planting, the native species common to all sites that obtained >80% survival rate were Casuarina equisetifolia L. Alstonia macrophylla Wall. ex. G.Don., Alstonia scholaris (L.) R.Br., and Parkia javanica (Lam.) Merr. and were comparable to an alien species Acacia mangium Willd. The species with the lowest survival rate (30%) across all sites was Duabanga moluccana Blume. Native species P. javanica, Eucalyptus deglupta Blume, and A. macrophylla all had a DGR of 34 mm year(-1) and were comparable with the alien species Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) S.F.Blake with 38 mm year(-1). However, the HGR of native species E. deglupta (245 cm year(-1)) and Melia dubia Cav. (230 cm year(-1)) were higher than an alien species S. parahyba (222 cm year(-1)). No native species can compete with the DGR (52 mm year(-1)) and HGR (384 cm year(-1)) of A. mangium. Rainfall significantly explained 13%-97% of DGR, HGR and survival rate of >70% of the species while air temperature explained about 17%-96% of the variations of similar variables. This early assessment provides a strong basis to better predict the early performances of native species in the Philippines. Through this, appropriate silvicultural intervention can be recommended towards improving the growth and survival of the native seedlings as alternative industrial tree plantation species in the country.

AB Monitoring seabird-derived nutrients on islands following invasive mammal eradications may provide a useful, cost- and time-efficient indication of the recovery of ecosystem function; however, the technique has only been investigated on environmentally similar islands. How seabird-derived nutrients recover on islands with different characteristics, and how differences in sampling regimes affect results is poorly understood. To determine how different island characteristics (size, geographic location and invasion history) and aspects of the sampling regime (sample collection year, season and intra-island location) influence seabird-derived nutrients we collated nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) data from three ecosystem components (soil, plants and spiders), collected on 28 islands around New Zealand. We investigated which variables best predict delta N-15 using linear-mixed effects models. Accounting for these variables and using still-invaded and never-invaded islands as controls for recovery, we then investigated changes in delta N-15 on islands at different stages following invasive mammal eradication. Island size, invasion history and the presence of seabirds in the direct vicinity of a sampling location all influenced delta N-15. After accounting for these variables, delta N-15 increased with time since eradication in soils, plants and spiders, though there was still some variation that our chosen variables could not explain. This study demonstrates the importance of considering island characteristics and sampling methods when assessing seabird-derived nutrient recovery and highlights the need for additional targeted sample collection on islands to help separate out the effects of time since eradication and other confounding variables affecting delta N-15. Improved understanding of these factors will be prerequisite for furthering this technique as a useful addition to the post-eradication monitoring tool kit.

AB Proactive approaches that anticipate the long-term effects of current and future conservation threats could increase the effectiveness and efficiency of biodiversity conservation. However, such approaches can be obstructed by a lack of knowledge of habitat requirements for wildlife. To aggregate and assess the suitability of current information available on habitat requirements needed for proactive conservation, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on elephant and rhinoceros habitat requirements and synthesized data by combining a vote counting assessment with bibliometric and term maps. We contextualized these numeric and terminological results with a narrative review. We mapped current methods, results, terminology, and collaborations of 693 studies. Quantitative evidence for factors that influence the suitability of an area for elephants and rhinoceros was biased toward African savanna elephants and ecological variables. Less than one third of holistic approaches considered equal amounts of ecological and anthropogenic variables in their assessments. There was a general lack of quantitative evidence for direct proxies of anthropogenic variables that were expected to play an important role based on qualitative evidence and policy documents. However, there was evidence for a segregation in conceptual frameworks among countries and species and between science versus policy literature. There was also evidence of unused potential for collaborations among southern hemisphere researchers. Our results indicated that the success of proactive conservation interventions can be increased if ecological and anthropogenic dimensions are integrated into holistic habitat assessments and holistic carrying capacities and quantitative evidence for anthropogenic variables is improved. To avoid wasting limited resources, it is necessary to form inclusive collaborations within and across networks of researchers studying different species across regional and continental borders and in the science-policy realm.

AB Trees and grasses compete for space in savanna landscapes where fire also suppresses trees, maintaining a lower tree/grass ratio than precipitation levels can support. While the effects of competition and fire have been considered largely in isolation, theory suggests that competition with grasses for water may limit the ability of juvenile trees to grow rapidly enough to escape flames holding them in a firetrap. This study examined the growth and survival rates of trees at different life stages on plots subjected to four different grass removal treatments with those on plots subjected to three different fire treatments in two mesic savannas in Mali. Two hypotheses were tested: (i) grass removal treatments will not significantly increase tree height growth rates; and (ii), burning earlier in the dry season will result in faster height growth rates and lower death rates than burning later. Trees were measured over 2 years. To compare how treatments affected tree growth, data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance with treatment type as a fixed factor. We find that grass removal resulted in increased juvenile tree growth varying from 147 to 205% depending on treatment. Grass treatments of hoeing, clipping and herbicide resulted in fewer tree deaths. Both early and late fires resulted in increased tree growth rates, although late fires resulted in more deaths. Mid-season fires did not significantly affect growth rates. Findings suggests that competition with grasses slows juvenile tree height growth and that a change in competition intensity is sufficient to cause a shift in savanna state to a more tree dominated one with implications for savanna management and carbon sequestration schemes.

AB In classic resilience thinking, there is an implicit focus on controlling functional variation to maintain system stability. Modern approaches to resilience thinking deal with complex, adaptive system dynamics and true uncertainty; these contemporary frameworks involve the process of learning to live with change and make use of the consequences of transformation and development. In a socio-environmental context, the identification of metrics by which resilience can be effectively and reliably measured is fundamental to understanding the unique vulnerabilities that characterize coupled human and natural systems. We developed an innovative procedure for stakeholder-friendly quantification of socio-environmental resilience metrics. These metrics were calculated and analyzed through the application of discrete disturbance simulations, which were produced using a dynamically coupled, biophysical-socioeconomic modeling framework. Following the development of a unique shock-response assessment regime, five metrics (time to baseline-level recovery, rate of return to baseline, degree of return to baseline, overall post-disturbance perturbation, and corrective impact of disturbance) describing distinct aspects of systemic resilience were quantified for three agroecosystem variables (farm income, water-table depth, and crop revenue) over a period of 30 years (1989-2019) in the Rechna Doab basin of northeastern Pakistan. Using this procedure, we determined that farm income is the least resilient variable of the three tested. Farm income was easily diverted from the "normal" functional paradigm for the Rechna Doab socio-environmental system, regardless of shock type, intensity, or duration combination. Crop revenue was the least stable variable (i.e., outputs fluctuated significantly between very high and very low values). Water-table depth was consistently the most robust and resistant to change, even under physical shock conditions. The procedure developed here should improve the ease with which stakeholders are able to conduct quantitative resilience analyses.

AB The deep-sea red and blue shrimp Aristeus antennatus is a commercially valuable species that occurs in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea where ripe females have been found in fishing areas. In the Palam ' os harbor, a local management plan restricts fishing in certain locations to sustain the resource. However, little is known about the dispersal of larvae; specifically, it is not known how far larvae are transported from spawning locations and if there could be mixing of larvae between different fishing areas. The objective of this study was to estimate the spawning sites of larvae collected at 35 sampling stations, evaluate uncertainty in the estimates, and determine if larvae could be exchanged between fishing areas. The spawning sites of larvae were estimated by backward simulation of larval trajectories using a 3-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and Lagrangian transport model. The backtracked larvae were assigned temperature-dependent stage durations based on a literature review of similar species. Results of model simulations indicated that the median distances from sampling to spawning locations were 11 and 38 km when shortest and longest pelagic durations (PD) were implemented, respectively. Sensitivity studies of backward trajectories showed that distance estimates could vary by as much as 27, 3, and 8 km due to differences in simulated PD, sub-grid-scale turbulence, and advection, respectively. Larvae from 13 of the 35 sampling stations were tracked back to multiple fishing grounds, suggesting that mixing of larvae from different fishing areas could occur. For example, for the sampling stations within the restricted area of Palam ' os, 35% of simulated larvae came from the restricted area itself, and 0.9% and 10% of larvae came from neighboring areas to the north and south, respectively. These results suggest that larval transport may connect subpopulations of A. antennatus across different fishing areas, an idea that may help inform regional management plans.

AB Vegetation classification systems form a base for conservation management and the ecological exploration of the patterns and drivers of species' distributions. A standardised system crossing administrative and geographical boundaries is widely recognised as most useful for broad-scale management. The Queensland Government, recognising this, uses the Regional Ecosystem (RE) classification system and accompanying mapping as a state-wide standardised vegetation classification system. This system informs legislation and policy at local, state and national levels, underpinning decisions that have wide-ranging implications for biodiversity and people's livelihoods. It therefore needs to be robust from a scientific and legal perspective. The current approach in the RE system for identifying vegetation communities relies on expert-based class definition procedures. This is in contrast to best practice, which is based on quantitative procedures. This paper discusses the RE system in a global context and outlines the updated approach that incorporates quantitative class definition procedures, synthesises the research behind the updated approach and discusses its implications and implementation.

AB Long-term studies of vegetation recovery following post-mining restoration in low-productivity, high-stress areas are limited, but essential for understanding underlying ecological processes and evaluating management practices. This study's goal was to describe temporal patterns of recovery (up to 37 years) in vegetation structure, floristic diversity, and composition following post-mining restoration at two sites, and identify potential drivers of restoration outcomes, in the nutrient-poor, seasonally dry, species-rich, fire-prone kwongan vegetation of southwest Western Australia. Vegetation development is progressing and restoration measures are within range of native reference values, but there is large variation in both patterns observed and restoration outcomes. Several patterns described share similarities with post-fire recovery of kwongan, and post-disturbance recovery of other low-productivity, high-stress, fire-prone systems. However, differences in some patterns between sites indicate differences in the underlying mechanisms of recovery. Many management and environmental variables emerge as significant drivers of restoration outcomes but age, fire, and the planting of seedlings account for the largest amount of variation. Adaptive management at both sites appears to be facilitating improved restoration outcomes over time. Using a combination of space-for-time, plot level, and linear mixed effects modeling perspectives to examine patterns provides greater insights into restoration recovery than a chronosequence perspective alone. This study will inform restoration practices and outcomes not only in kwongan but in other comparable systems also.

TI Towards a replicator dynamics model of age structured populations
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GROWTH
AB We present a new modelling framework combining replicator dynamics, the standard model of frequency dependent selection, with an age-structured population model. The new framework allows for the modelling of populations consisting of competing strategies carried by individuals who change across their life cycle. Firstly the discretization of the McKendrick von Foerster model is derived. We show that the Euler-Lotka equation is satisfied when the new model reaches a steady state (i.e. stable frequencies between the age classes). This discretization consists of unit age classes where the timescale is chosen so that only a fraction of individuals play a single game round. This implies a linear dynamics and individuals not killed during the round are moved to the next age class; linearity means that the system is equivalent to a large Bernadelli-Lewis-Leslie matrix. Then we use the methodology of multipopulation games to derive two, mutually equivalent systems of equations. The first contains equations describing the evolution of the strategy frequencies in the whole population, completed by subsystems of equations describing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy. The second contains equations describing the changes of the general population's age structure, completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection of the strategies within each age class. We then present the obtained system of replicator dynamics in the form of the mixed ODE-PDE system which is independent of the chosen timescale, and much simpler. The obtained results are illustrated by the example of the sex ratio model which shows that when different mortalities of the sexes are assumed, the sex ratio of 0.5 is obtained but that Fisher's mechanism, driven by the reproductive value of the different sexes, is not in equilibrium.

AB Prawn-plant eco-symbiotic culture system (PECS) is an efficient symbiotic culture system, in which prawn and plants are placed in the same culture space according to a certain proportion. In the study, the potential of PECS to impact microbial communities and metabolites in the intestine of cultured giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii is assessed. We found that the growth parameters (such as length gain, weight gain and specific growth rate) of PECS with 15 % feed ratio were significantly improved by 4 week culture. And PECS modulated growth profiles of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Atopobium cluster, and Roseburia subcluster bacteria, all of which increased significantly with 15 % feed ratio in the intestines of M. rosenbergii. Growth of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and bacteria referable to the Desulfovibrionales and Desulfuromonadales, were influenced by PECS, whereas growth of Clostridium histolyticum and C. coccoides/Eubacterium rectale groups were not significantly affected. PECS with 15 % feed ratio positively impacted short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) production, and reduced lactate levels, without causing any ammonia cytotoxic effects. Well growth performance of the prawn was consistent with increase in intestinal benefit microbiota. In general, PECS (with a feed ratio of 15 %) proved to be beneficial for promoting organic acids and growth performance via modulated intestinal microbiota, indicating PECS with reasonable feed ratio represent a promising alternative to traditional pond monoculture of M. rosenbergii.

AB Land use change, coupled with rapid human population growth, has increased ecosystem degradation, giving rise to ecosystem restoration initiatives worldwide. We conducted an assessment and reflection using a feedback framework for strategic adaptive management in three woodland restoration initiatives in South Africa. This is because assessment and reflection are critical components for successful strategic adaptive management. We found that the three restoration initiatives have had a limited emphasis on sustainable livelihood driven outcomes, because the initiatives mainly aimed to restore biodiversity, ecosystem infrastructure and ecosystem services. Consequently, we propose a modified livelihood framework that suggests a more inclusive approach towards achieving positive human outcome-driven restoration of degraded woodlands. Based on the framework, we emphasise that restoration initiatives should seek to invest in ecosystem restoration in the context of sustainable development goals, to enhance people's livelihoods, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Harmonizing the competing needs for resource allocation, sustainable interventions and livelihoods sustenance will be important, given the limited extent of alternative locally based livelihood options in the rural disadvantaged areas. This is because most of the rural population is largely dependent on woodland ecosystem services for their livelihoods. We then suggest that to ensure that human-driven outcomes are also equally prioritised; the assessment, reflection and feedback framework and the livelihoods framework should form part of restoration initiatives.

AB Promoting human-carnivore coexistence is a main component of carnivore conservation. Coexistence programmes are usually informed by attitudinal studies that evaluate intended behaviour towards carnivores. This questionnaire survey assesses attitudes of governmental and non-governmental conservation stakeholders in Zimbabwe towards living with carnivores, large carnivore species and the conservation of wildlife, and determines whether being part of coexistence programmes (CAMPFIRE, TFCAs) positively affects attitudes. Stakeholder attitudes were most positive when employment was directly related to wildlife and stakeholders had knowledge about and exposure to carnivores. Stakeholders who depend on livestock and/or had little knowledge about and less exposure to carnivores were most negative, this included governmental stakeholders responsible for natural resource management. Positive attitudes were largely based on the aesthetic and economic value of carnivores, while negative attitudes were based on the fear of livestock loss and perceived danger to humans. Subsistence farmers were the most negative stakeholders, as such, the focus on this group to promote coexistence seems justified. However, although some stakeholders were more positive in CAMPFIRE areas or TFCAs, CAMPFIRE and TFCAs failed to improve attitudes of subsistence farmers, which highlights a need to evaluate and adapt these programmes.

AB A study was conducted to assess botanical composition, biomass yield, nutritive value and methane production of forages in the grasslands of Kofele district in West Arsi Zone of Oromia National Regional State, southern Ethiopia. Three patches of the grassland including protected grassland, private grazing land used by smallholder farmers and ranch were selected for the study to represent three different grazing land management practices. Quadrats of 0.5 m x 0.5 m were used to determine biomass yield and collect samples of herbaceous forages from each site (12 quadrats from each site). For woody species four 10 m x 10 m plots were established along transect of 200 m with 20 m distance between plots to identify available species (in the ranch only). A total of 20 herbaceous species were identified, out of which 45% were grasses, 15% legumes, 10% sedges and 30% forbs. Out of 17 browse species identified in the ranch, 47.1% were trees while 52.9% were shrubs. The total biomass production from protected grassland (4.34 t/ha) was higher (P<0.05) than that of private grazing land (3.66 t/ha) and ranch (3.76 t/ha). Biomass production of sedge and forbs were the highest (P<0.05) in ranch. The ranges of chemical constituents for grasses were 8.44-10.74%, 52.8-72%, 27.7-37.4%, 3.1-5.6%, 58.2-76% for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), respectively. The CP and IVDMD for legumes varied from 15.64-20.33% and 80.1-85-1%, respectively. For browses the ranges of CP and IVDMD were 15.41-27.19% and 57.4-81.9%, respectively.. Among grass species, Eragrostis botryodes generated less methane. In general, legumes (5.5-6.5 mL/200 mg) and sedge (6 mL/200 mg) produced less amount of methane compared with grasses (7-10.5 mL/200 mg). Browses (9.5-13.5 mL/200 mg) produced more methane compared with herbaceous species (5.5-10.5 mL/200 mg). In conclusion protecting grassland and using cut and carry feeding system promoted more herbage production. The CP content of grass is generally good but supplementation with legumes and browses are required in practical feeding. The use of legumes with grasses and other browse species is recommended as a feeding strategy to reduce methane production However; further investigations on animal response trials are suggested to see the potential of these feed resources.

ID TREE-GRASS COEXISTENCE; DETERMINANTS; FOREST; COMPETITION; WATER
AB In this article, the stability of equilibrium solutions of a recently formulated mathematical model of Savanna ecosystem is analytically and numerically analyzed. The mathematical model is formulated by generalizing all plant life into three components; trees, tree saplings, and grass under ecologically valid effects of fire, rainfall and competition for space. Fire has a considerable effect on trees by delaying the recruitment of saplings to trees and the recruitment rate is a piecewise linear decreasing function of grass with a sigmoidal shape. This leads to there existing different equilibria in the plant community of a Savanna ecosystem. It is rigorously demonstrated that the local stability of equilibria depends on the slope and value of the recruitment function. Moreover, it is found that the composition of high grass cover and low tree cover or low grass cover and high tree cover are the stable equilibria, while intermediate cover results in unstable equilibria. In analyzing the global stability of solutions, it is found that the limit set is an equilibrium solution. Several numerical simulations are provided to validate the analytical studies of the behavior of the equilibrium solutions. The numerical solutions are generated using a Python ordinary differential equation(ODE) solver. The analytical and numerical solutions presented in this work are very important for further developments in the area of mathematical ecology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Fire; Grassland; Soil CO2 flux; Soil respiration; Aboveground net
   primary production; Carbon cycling; Ecosystem
AB Aims Fire regimes are key drivers of ecosystem dynamics and are changing worldwide. Uncertainty about how fire history affects responses to individual fires hampers predictions of fire impacts on important ecosystem functions such as C cycling. Thus, we assessed how fire and fire history affect soil CO2 flux and aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Methods We utilized a 35-year fire frequency experiment in a mesic grassland to quantify how two aspects of fire history, long-term fire frequency (fire every one, two, or four years, or no fire) and number of years elapsed since the most recent fire, affect soil CO2 flux. We used long-term annual records from the same grassland to compare this to the effect of fire history on ANPP. Results Historic fire frequency altered the soil CO2 flux response to fire, with greater post-fire stimulation in grassland burned annually than in grassland burned less frequently (similar to 100% vs. similar to 44% increase over long-term unburned grassland). The flux increase persisted for up to two years after fire. Though fire also stimulated ANPP, this increase did not vary by long-term fire frequency and did not persist into later years. Conclusions Fire history modifies the soil CO2 flux response to individual fires in this grassland. Predicting the dynamics of this important C flux will require considering not only the presence vs. absence of fire, but also fire history.

AB Fuelwood is an essential source of energy for rural populations in many ecosystems. However, little research has addressed the role of exotic species in relation to the use of native woody plants for fuel. This study was performed in rural communities of three ecoregions of Argentina (the phytogeographical provinces of Chaco, Pampa and Patagonia). Basing our study on the diversification hypothesis, we evaluated whether the exotic species used alongside native plants vary in each region. We also studied diversification in relation to gathering environments and use strategies. Open and semi-structured interviews were conducted in 72 households, focusing on the total richness of fuelwood used and its use pressure. We used the ratio between exotic and native richness as an indirect measure of diversification. Data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of 78 species was recorded, of which 51 were native and 27 exotic. Gathering is the most common supply strategy in all the ecoregions studied, fuelwood being obtained mainly in sites with little human intervention. A generalized linear model showed that the use of native versus exotic species varied according to the ecoregion and the level of human intervention in the supply area, while acquisition strategies were similar for both native and exotic species in all ecoregions. The areas with most human intervention were always used to gather exotic plants. In line with our hypothesis, UWPF diversification with exotic species varied according to ecoregion. Intrinsic characteristics associated with the history of each region possibly explain the findings.

AB Biological invasions can lead to the reassembly of communities and understanding and predicting the impacts of exotic species on community structure and functioning are a key challenge in ecology. We investigated the impact of a predatory species of invasive ant, Pheidole megacephala, on the structure and function of a foundational mutualism between Acacia drepanolobium and its associated acacia-ant community in an East African savanna. Invasion by P. megacephala was associated with the extirpation of three extrafloral nectar-dependent Crematogaster acacia ant species and strong increases in the abundance of a competitively subordinate and locally rare acacia ant species, Tetraponera penzigi, which does not depend on host plant nectar. Using a combination of long-term monitoring of invasion dynamics, observations and experiments, we demonstrate that P. megacephala directly and indirectly facilitates T. penzigi by reducing the abundance of T. penzigi's competitors (Crematogaster spp.), imposing recruitment limitation on these competitors, and generating a landscape of low-reward host plants that favor colonization and establishment by the strongly dispersing T. penzigi. Seasonal variation in use of host plants by P. megacephala may further increase the persistence of T. penzigi colonies in invaded habitat. The persistence of the T. penzigi-A. drepanolobium symbiosis in invaded areas afforded host plants some protection against herbivory by elephants (Loxodonta africana), a key browser that reduces tree cover. However, elephant damage on T. penzigi-occupied trees was higher in invaded than in uninvaded areas, likely owing to reduced T. penzigi colony size in invaded habitats. Our results reveal the mechanisms underlying the disruption of this mutualism and suggest that P. megacephala invasion may drive long-term declines in tree cover, despite the partial persistence of the ant-acacia symbiosis in invaded areas.

AB The effects of a single trait on more than one ecological function is called ecological pleiotropy. Traits that exhibit ecological pleiotropy are relevant to eco-evolutionary dynamics because the structure of interaction between the trait and its ecological functions alters how eco-evolutionary feedback loops emerge. Density-dependent selection (DDS) assumes that a single trait affects both density-independent and density-dependent population growth through ecological pleiotropy, and is one of the simplest routes for feedback loops. The r/K theory proposes a mechanism by which DDS occurs, but its predictions were poorly explored in an eco-evolutionary context. Some assumptions of the r/K theory seems to be relevant for the eco-evolution of predator-prey interactions. However, the relationship between these theories were poorly explored. Here, we investigate how does the r/K theory relates to the eco-evolution of predator-prey systems. We seek to answer two questions: (1) What are the system's parameters that affect the predominance of r- and K-selection? (2) Does system's qualitative behaviour depends on whether the predominant selection on prey population is an r- or a K-selection? To answer these questions, we built a model of differential equations describing the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a predator-prey system. We assume that prey vulnerability to predation is an adaptive trait that affects preys density-dependent growth rate through ecological pleiotropy. Then, we partitioned the selection gradient in its r- and K-selection components and evaluate how their magnitude relates to systems behaviour. We found that stable predator-prey cycles only occurs when K-selection is predominant. When r-selection is predominant, cycles lead to a runaway dynamics. Furthermore, the way predators parameters affect prey position in the r/K continuum depends on how they affect predation risk. While increasing predation risk increases K-selection, decreasing it increases r-selection. We discuss the relevance of the structure of ecological pleiotropy to our results and the perspectives that unifies the r/K theory and eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB The trace fossil Bichordites appears as an intrastratal burrow and occurs in shallow-marine deposits. Its modern counterpart is the burrow produced by the spatangoid echinoid Echinocardium cordatum, found in shallow-marine regions. The relationship between burrow size and tracemaker population density was studied in the modern, subtidal, sandy deposits of a ria coast in the northeastern Japan. Burrow size decreases with increasing population density in the modern counterpart, suggesting that trace fossil size in Bichordites can be used as a proxy to quantify tracemaker population density at the time of trace formation. However, the factors that control burrow size are unclear and warrant further investigation.

AB Physical disturbances, such as fire, may affect the relationship between ants and plants. We evaluated the extent to which severe fires alter the protective effect of ants against the herbivores of an extrafloral-nectary bearing tree. We performed an ant removal experiment and sampled the ant fauna from the same trees over 4 years: the pre-fire year, the fire-year, and again 1 and 2 years later. Ants reduced insect herbivory in the pre-fire year and in the fire-year but failed to provide any plant protection in the two years after fire. The magnitude of the ant effect on herbivory did not differ between the pre-fire year and the fire-year. Fire reduced the abundance of ants with strictly arboreal-nesting habits. However, in the fire year (but not in the subsequent ones), this decline was compensated by an increase in the abundance of arboreal generalists and ground-nesting ants foraging in trees. Our results indicate that severe fires can affect the strength and direction of the ant effects on herbivory by altering the structure of the arboreal ant community and the abundance of insect herbivores. Fire disturbance is thus an important factor of conditionality of ant-plant mutualisms in fire-prone habitats, like the Cerrado savannas.

AB We used a trait-based approach to disentangle Darwin's conundrum along environmental gradients and tested the contribution of earlier established invaders to biotic resistance of resident communities in boreal lakes. For this, we used a linear mixed model to test if lake surface area, water temperature, the proportion of earlier established invaders and functional distances to resident species predict the establishment of introduced species. We found that in colder and smaller lakes, introduced fishes that were ecologically distant to resident species had higher establishment success, supporting Darwin's naturalisation hypothesis. However, in warmer and larger lakes, the establishment was higher for species ecologically closer to residents, supporting the adaptation hypothesis. Therefore, the support for Darwin's hypotheses depends on how environmental gradients affect biotic interactions. Contrary to our expectation, we found that earlier established invaders seem to favour the establishment of further introduced species and did not contribute to the biotic resistance of the resident community. Our study revealed that using environmental gradients is essential to disentangle Darwin's conundrum for introduced species in boreal lakes and contribute to explain why the results of previous studies are conflicting.

AB Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Miller) has been one of the most used Pinus species in reforestation in the Mediterranean Basin and in many other regions outside its native range. Its massive use in plantations combined with its low environmental requirements, relatively short juvenile period and adaptability to human disturbance make P. halepensis a great competitor for local species, becoming invasive in many natural and anthropized areas. As little is known about the effects of these plantations on oceanic islands ecosystems, we evaluated in this study the expansion dynamics of a series of P. halepensis plantations carried out on the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands) in the 1960s and 1970s of the past century. At short distance, we counted and measured P. halepensis individuals along transects of 140 m from the inside of the plantation to the outside, assessing also the proportion occupied by other native, endemic and ruderal species in two habitat types: thermo-sclerophyllous woodlands and laurel forests. To examine seed dispersal over longer distances, we selected one of the areas that showed a greater expansion and we analyzed factors influencing regeneration. Our results revealed that expansion is occurring mostly in open or disturbed areas instead of closed-canopy humid forests and we found a clear negative relationship between the presence of the species and the abundance of other trees or the endemic and native flora. Furthermore, we detected potential new foci of regeneration away from the plantations too. Overall, we suggest that the status of P. halepensis as a non-native species and its classification for the purposes of management in the Canary Islands needs to be re-examined.

AB The nemertean Malacobdella arrokeana is a commensal of the edible giant bivalve Panopea abbreviata; both species have a restricted geographic distribution, high specificity and populations settled along distinct biogeographic provinces. This supposes a high genetic structuring among populations and low intra-populational variability; nevertheless, a lack of genetic structure was detected previously between M. arrokeana populations from the Atlantic Northern Patagonia Gulfs System (NPGS) by means of mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Here, we present a model that explains this lack of genetic structure, integrating larval development and behavior, as well as bio-oceanographical model simulations. We observed in cultured larvae a maximum 30 days of planktonic life before settlement. Planuliform larval morphology and behavior of M. arrokeana suggested that the dispersion is more influenced by passive transport rather than active swimming. Modeling larvae as particles indicated that the limit of biogeographical provinces along the NPGS is not a barrier for dispersal, corroborating that larval dispersion is strictly related to season and to hydrodynamic diffusion patterns present in the area. These results explain the lack of genetic population structure recorded before in the NPGS. Our results provide novel baseline data regarding larval connectivity and oceanographic circulation patterns on the southwestern Atlantic. This information can be used as a reference for the implementation of management plans of invertebrate species with pelagic larvae to ensure the long-term viability of fishery resources shared by different government districts.

AB The Pleistocene ungulate communities from the western coastal plains of South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR) are diverse and dominated by grazers, in contrast to the region's Holocene and historical faunas, which are relatively species-poor and dominated by small-bodied browsers and mixed feeders. An expansion of grassy habitats is clearly implied by the Pleistocene faunas, but the presence of ruminant grazers that cannot survive the summer dry season typical of the region today suggests other important paleoecological changes. Here we use dental ecometrics to explore the paleoecological implications of the region's Pleistocene faunas. We show that the dental traits (hypsodonty and occlusal topography) of the ungulates that occurred historically in the CFR track annual and summer aridity, and we use these relationships to reconstruct past aridity. Our results indicate that the Pleistocene faunas signal paleoenvironments that were on average less arid than today, including during the summer, consistent with other lines of evidence that suggest a higher water table and expansion of well-watered habitats. Greater water availability can be explained by lower temperature and reduced evapotranspiration during cooler phases of the Pleistocene, probably coupled with enhanced groundwater recharge due to increased winter precipitation.

AB Crocodilians are distributed widely through the tropics and subtropics, and several species pose a substantial threat to human life. This has important implications for human safety and crocodilian conservation. Understanding the drivers of crocodilian attacks on people could help minimize future attacks and inform conflict management. Crocodilian attacks follow a seasonal pattern in many regions, but there has been limited analysis of the relationship between attack occurrence and fine-scale contemporaneous environmental conditions. We use methods from environmental niche modelling to explore the relationships between attacks on people and abiotic predictors at a daily temporal resolution for the Nile crocodileCrocodylus niloticusin South Africa and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and the American alligatorAlligator mississippiensisin Florida, USA. Our results indicate that ambient daily temperature is the most important abiotic temporal predictor of attack occurrence for both species, with attack likelihood increasing markedly when mean daily temperatures exceed 18 degrees C and peaking at 28 degrees C. It is likely that this relationship is explained partially by human propensity to spend time in and around water in warmer weather but also by the effect of temperature on crocodilian hunting behaviour and physiology, especially the ability to digest food. We discuss the potential of our findings to contribute to the management of crocodilians, with benefits for both human safety and conservation, and the application of environmental niche modelling for understanding human-wildlife conflicts involving both ectotherms and endotherms.

AB This study investigated the impact of exoticTamarixspecies on vascular plant biodiversity in riparian ecosystems in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Vegetation was sampled, using 5 m wide belt transects, along the Leeu, Swart, and Olifants riparian areas, which had varying invasion intensities. Each transect was split into three zones (Zone 1: 0-15 m; Zone 2: 15-35, and Zone 3: >35 m), which were identified at each site based on species composition across each riparian zone. Woody plant species were identified, counted, and their heights measured within the transects that were laid out from the waterpoint (Zone 1) outwards (Zone 2 and 3). Herbaceous aerial cover (HAC) was determined subjectively and objectified using the Walker aerial cover scale. Leeu River had the highest species richness (Dmg = 2.79), diversity (H ' = 2.17; -ln lambda = 1.91; N1 = 8.76 and alpha = 4.13), and evenness (J '= 0.80). The Swart River had the lowest species richness, which declined from Dmg = 1.96 (Zone 1) to Dmg = 1.82 (Zone 3). ExoticTamarixspecies ranked in the top three most abundant woody vascular plant species along the Swart and Olifants rivers, where they ranked first and third, respectively. The Jaccard's and Sorenson's coefficients of similarity indicated that species differed greatly between the different sites,x over bar < 27% for both indices. The indices also indicated that the Swart River had the lowest level of species distinctness between zones (x over bar > 80%) while the Leeu River had the highest level of species distinctness (x over bar < 50%) between the different zones. These findings suggest a possible displacement of herbaceous and woody tree species by exoticTamarixinvasion, inter alia, a decrease in ecosystem functions and services associated with the loss in biodiversity, as well as significant bearings on the agricultural ecosystem by reducing the faunal diversity such as crop pollinators, inter alia.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae are predators that construct pitfall traps in fine sand. We used three-dimensional laser scanning and geometric morphometrics to reveal the shape of antlion pits of two antlion species, analysed the particle size composition of sands from the different natural habitats, and measured the slope angles of the pits of the two species. In most antlions, the pits are structured as a simple inverted cone, as in Myrmeleon hyalinus, studied here. The other antlion studied, Cueta lineosa, constructs a unique pit composed of two inverted truncated cones inserted into one another, which feature substantially steeper walls than the pits of any other antlion studied to date. Pit stability depends on the slope inclination, which oscillates between the maximum angle of stability and the angle of repose. The angles in C. linosa substrates were larger than those in M. hyalinus substrates. One reason for the steeper walls is the greater proportion of fine sand in the natural sand inhabited by C. lineosa. However, video-recording revealed that both the natural sand of C. lineosa and the finest sand tested had a higher maximum angle of stability than any of the other substrates studied here. Furthermore, experiments with pits built in different substrates revealed that the shape of the pit is variable and depends on the structure of the sand. Myrmeleon hyalinus displayed a more flexible pit construction behaviour than C. lineosa. The present demonstration of such differences in pit characteristics contributes to understanding how these two species co-exist in the same habitat.

AB Because of their lifestyles, abundance, and feeding habits, infaunal marine deposit feeders have a significant impact on the ocean floor. As these animals also ingest microorganisms associated with their sediment and seawater diet, their digestive tract usually contains a diverse array of bacteria. However, while most of these microorganisms are transients, some may become part of a resident gut microbiome, in particular when sheltered from the main flow of digesta in specialized gut compartments. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and contents of the intestinal caecum (IC), a hindgut diverticulum found exclusively in schizasterid heart urchins (Echinoidea: Spatangoida: Schizasteridae). Based on specimens ofBrisaster townsendi, in addition to various other schizasterid taxa, our structural characterization of the IC shows that the organ is a highly specialized gut compartment with unique structural properties. Next generation sequencing shows that the IC contains a microbial population composed predominantly of Bacteroidales, Desulfobacterales, and Spirochaetales. The microbiome of this gut compartment is significantly different in composition and lower in diversity than the microbial population in the sediment-filled main digestive tract. Inferences on the function and evolution of the IC and its microbiome suggest that this symbiosis plays a distinct role in host nutrition and that it evolved at least 66 million years ago during the final phase of the Mesozoic.

AB The antlion larvae (Myrmeleontidae) are ambush predators. They detect substrate-borne vibrations induced by the movement of the prey. European pit-building antlions (Myrmeleon inconspicuus) are studied for their ability to perceive vibrations generated by the locomotion of an ant (Cataglyphis cursor) outside the pit. These strides have been recorded and copied in detail in their time sequences. The signal created was emitted by piezoelectric transducers placed several centimeters outside the peripheries of the pits: the ant movements create waves with particle accelerations that are three orders of magnitude less thang, alleviating any possibility of sand avalanche towards the bottom of the pit. Depending on the amplitude of the vibrations, the antlions answer back, generally by sand tossing. One remarkable feature is the time delay between the start of the cue and the predatory behaviour induced by this cue. This time delay is studied versus the cue amplitude. We found that antlions answer back within minutes to cues with amplitudes of nanometer range, and within seconds to these same cues if they are preceded by a sequence of signals at the angstrom ngstrom amplitude. This difference in latency is used to evidence the sensitivity to vibrations at an extremely low level.

AB The legalization of rhino horn 'domestic' trade in South Africa potentially unleashes market forces featuring new entry, new tastes and new rhino horn products. This risks escalating the rhino-poaching crisis further. It is argued that institutional contradictions have been engendered by the South African High Court ruling in Kruger and another v Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs and others [2015] JOL 34725, whose assumptions are shown to be highly restrictive and seemingly poorly informed about the true nature of demand for rhino horn and the dynamics of poaching. The shortcoming in the legal decision-making pertains to not taking account of the absence of any evidence for the existence of domestic demand for rhino horns in South Africa. The key arguments presented herein align with support for the reinstitution of the rhino horn trade moratorium, as well as administrative measures implemented effectively to contain the poaching crisis.

AB This article is about the relationship between vulnerability and space. It examines how vulnerability moves and shifts in relation to space - and more specifically particular types of spaces - and how space both generates vulnerability and affects the experiential 'living' of vulnerability. With a specific focus on conflict-related sexual violence, and drawing on empirical data from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia and Uganda, the article situates and discusses the relationship between vulnerability and space within a broader transitional justice framework. Underlining the need for transitional justice processes to give more attention to spaces of vulnerability, it foregrounds the notion of 'spatial resilience' as providing a conceptual frame for an ecological remodelling of transitional justice.

AB Land clearing of habitat into smaller, isolated remnants is a major driver of plant and animal extinctions globally. In southeastern Australia, once widespread temperate savannas have been subjected to extensive land clearing since European settlement. Some small fragments have persisted, but declines in the dominant trees have been reported, with anecdotal observations of widespread recruitment bottlenecks and seed set failure. To test the hypothesis that populations of Banksia marginata are experiencing widespread recruitment bottlenecks, we examined tree size-class distribution and production of infructescences (cones) of 15 populations on the western plains of Victoria, Australia. We found no evidence of widespread recruitment bottlenecks or a failure to set seeds; most populations were recruiting, though we did find evidence of declining recruitment with population size, suggesting evidence of an Allee effect. The proportion of trees without cones varied between populations; three populations had large numbers of trees (> 40%) lacking mature fertile cones. Managers should focus on minimising threats to seedling survival and augment populations below 100 individuals to improve recruitment and maintain stand persistence in the landscape.

AB Basic patterns of most priority biodiversity areas of Kosovo that shall be considered for conservation studies arc offered here. On this work, all plant taxa that are included in the Kosovarian Red list are analysed and their analogy is interpreted to conservation priority hotspots. Kosovo represents an important centre for Balkan biodiversity; therefore a quantitative evaluation of the importance of different priority areas for conserving plant diversity of Kosovo is very much needed. This study provides a detailed quantitative approach concerning the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, using threatened and endangered plant taxa in well-known grid squares system. Used grid squares (20 x 20km) were classified into four different groups in terms of their conservation importance. Valuation factors taken into account are IUCN based risk category, endemism as well as ecological and distributional attributes. The results indicated that there are four grid squares - D4 (0.4300), G7 (0.3910), G8 (0.2750) and E4 (0.2860), that have remarkable conservation importance. These grid squares are all located along mostly high-elevation areas of two National Parks in Kosovo. These national scale data should prove to be very appropriate and easy to follow evidence for environmental decision-making bodies as well as be used for further research.

AB Seabirds drastically alter the ecosystems where they establish their colonies. However, previous studies have not considered how colonies of the same species affect their surroundings in different environmental contexts. The main objective of this study was to determine the degree to which environmental factors (particularly climate and lithology) modulate the impact of seabird colonies on soil nutrients. For this purpose, two breeding colonies of the yellow-legged gull were selected: one located in the Atlantic Islands National Park (AINP, Atlantic region) and the other in Calanques National Park (CNP, Mediterranean region). in both parks, samples of soil and excrement were obtained from colonies with different densities of birds and in control zones, without birds, in two different seasons (winter and summer). The samples were analysed to determine the concentrations of N-NO3-, N-NH4+, total P and different geochemical P forms, including bioavailable P. The colony soils were enriched in N and P relative to soils from the control zones. However, the annual nutrient dynamics were modulated by the environmental conditions in each park. In winter in CNP, NH4+ concentrations were low and similar to those in the control zones, while the concentrations of NO3- were highest at this time of year. By contrast, in AINP, the annual N cycling appeared to be less variable, although the NH4+ concentrations were lower than in the control zone in winter, while those of NO3- remained high, despite the high rainfall in this season. The concentrations of P (total and bioavailable) remained high in soils in both parks throughout the year. However, fractionation of the P forms revealed different geochemical behaviour at the two sites. In CNP, calcium phosphate and residual P were the dominant fractions. In AINP, the P was distributed more homogeneously between the different fractions, with a slight predominance of the P associated with Al hydroxides and clays. The findings clearly show alteration of the cycling of both nutrients in both parks, although the impact is modulated by the environmental conditions at each location.

AB Plant-available water (PAW) is one of the most important issues in productive landscapes around the world. Besides climatic conditions, it depends on several factors, among them, land uses, the rooting and water table depths, and the presence of soil heterogeneities (e.g., petrocalcic horizons). In the present work, PAW evolution was assessed over 441 days in a vertical 1D domain of a monitored Pampean petrocalcic soil under two different land uses and contrasted water demand (i.e., natural and afforested grasslands). For this purpose, rooting depths were estimated using a process-based numerical model of the aquifer-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum constrained by both in situ measured atmospheric demand and water table fluctuations. This model was calibrated against soil water content measurements at different depths and finally, as validation, computed transpiration rates were compared with the sap flow measurements. Modeling results, and calibrated rooting depths, suggest that petrocalcic horizons induce a limited hydraulic connection between the shallow soil portions and the phreatic aquifer. Thus, water storage is enhanced above the petrocalcic horizon in the natural grassland plot particularly during the periods of low atmospheric demand, whereas it is immediately consumed by forest to soil wilting point below the afforested grassland (hydric stress). The numerical methodology followed here appears as an alternative to estimate the forest groundwater usage in afforested grasslands, a key issue in soil salinization research in great plain areas.

AB 1. Pollinator-mediated reproductive interactions among co-flowering plant species are prime examples of how species interactions may affect fitness and community assembly. Despite considerable interest in these issues, statistical methods for assessing signal of reproductive interactions in observational data on co-flowering species are currently lacking.
   2. We propose a flexible method for quantifying potential reproductive interactions among co-flowering plant species using the hierarchical latent-variable joint models implemented in the Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) framework. The method accommodates any measure of reproductive success, including pollinator visitation, stigma pollen loads, and seed set. We demonstrate the method by analysing a dataset on bumblebee visitation to a set of co-flowering plant species in a species-rich meadow in Norway, and provide R tutorials for this and additional data types.
   3. The example analysis revealed both positive and negative effects of heterospecific flower abundances on visitation to co-flowering species, which we interpret as potential reproductive interactions.
   4. Synthesis. Hierarchical joint models provide a flexible approach to analysing patterns of covariation in the reproductive success of co-flowering species, thus identifying potential species interactions. Important strengths include explicit consideration of community-level effects and the assessment of residual fitness correlations after controlling for covariates such as flower abundances and phenotypic traits, yielding more complete insights into pollinator-mediated reproductive interactions.

Over the years a number of projects have been implemented aimed at countering the adverse effects that resulted from isolation of the St Lucia mouth. The most recent (2016/2017) project is the Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded initiative to restore the common St Lucia-uMfolozi River mouth. During, but especially after completion of the rehabilitation project, distinct changes in the sediment grain size composition of the estuarine substratum were observed, resulting primarily from deposition of uMfolozi River sediment in the area. Before commencement of the project (i.e. prior to June 2016) coarse and medium sediment (500 mu m and 250 mu m, respectively) dominated. After project completion (July 2017 onwards) the substrate became muddy as a shift from coarse and medium grains to silt (<63 mu m) occurred. Preliminary analyses show a corresponding shift in zooplankton and macrofauna composition. Impacts on other animals, including hippopotami and crocodiles, as well as on various flora have also been observed.

ID HETEROGENEITY; STABILITY; MODELS
AB In pursuance of differing goals and ideologies, nations, religions, political groups rising against themselves have characterized human existence over the years. In recent times, such animosities have widened to the point of dehumanization and wide destruction of properties with threat and fear as strong arsenal. Terrorism has become very prevalent especially its many new forms that use drones and chemical and biological weapons. A mathematical model helps to explain a system (mutable natural occurrences such as dynamics in terrorism) by a painstaking study of different components of terrorists' splinter cells ranging from foot soldiers, intelligent mission units, kidnappers, and suicide bombers, to make predictions about its behaviour. This work argues the use of mathematical models to study terrorism by providing insights into evolving trends. The specific objective of this study is to investigate how to improve the understanding of the policymakers on terrorism mitigation. The study adopted a mathematical modelling and theoretical design. The mathematical equations formulated were based on the underlying principles of terrorism, which include recruitment, desertion from group, counter-terrorism measures, et cetera. The models were sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations based on assumptions emanating from the literature reviewed on terrorism. Qualitative analysis and relevant numerical simulations of the model were carried out. The results illustrate new approach on which terrorism can be reduced.

AB The idea that selection works in different ways during free population growth and at the equilibrium population size has been present in theoretical biology for a long time. It was first expressed as an r and K selection concept and later clarified in the debate on fitness measures in life history theory. The latest discussion related to this topic is focused on the nest site lottery mechanism and the resulting new population growth model. In this mechanistic biphasic model, the suppression of growth is induced by a shortage of free nest sites for newborns. Before it occurs, the population can grow exponentially. In this paper, the continuous version of the model and its selective properties are analysed. We show a continuous smooth transition between different fitness measures operating during the exponential growth and suppressed growth phase and at the equilibrium population size. Then, the model is extended to the case of a population of parasites, where a constant number of nest sites is replaced by the dynamics of a population of their hosts, in the role of the limiting supply. Parasite strategies are selected under exponential and suppressed growth phases of the population of hosts. Transitions between different fitness measures and conditions for extinction of hosts by parasites are analysed. An interesting result is the possibility of a continuum of fitness measures of parasites for the unsuppressed exponential growth of the host population.

AB Humans are the main drivers of the introduction, establishment and spread of non-native species worldwide but they have traditionally been excluded from management. Nowadays, the social component of non-native species is increasingly considered. In this paper, we investigated understanding, perceptions and attitudes towards management of non-native herbaceous plant species on Navarino, a remote Chilean sub-Antarctic island. Overall, our study showed a general understanding of the non-native species concept among the interviewees but revealed a lack of consciousness regarding non-native plants species in the local context. Interestingly, our study also revealed many positive values associated with non-native plants species on Navarino, particularly the esthetic value. Whilst some non-native plants were strictly associated with positive values, such as common daisy (Bellis perennis) and white clover (Trifolium repens), most species were associated with conflicting values. As a key result, our study lastly showed that most interviewees were indifferent about the management of the non-native herbaceous plant species. We, therefore, suggest (i) increasing the awareness of stakeholders with respect to non-native plants, (ii) incorporating stakeholder's values into future management decisions and (iii) considering the strategic location of Navarino Island as a potential stepping stone for the dispersion of non-native plants species towards the Antarctic.

AB Environmental stress can impair the survival, growth performance, and intestinal environment of shrimp. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of glutathione (GSH) on the survival, growth performance, intestinal oxidation, microbiota, and histology of shrimp under hypoxia. Four treatments were used: (1) normoxia, (2) cyclic serious/medium hypoxia (CSMH), (3) CSMH and 75 mg kg(-1) GSH, and (4) CSMH and 150 mg kg(-1) GSH. White shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) in groups 3 and 4 were fed a commercial diet supplemented with 75 and 150 mg kg(-1) GSH for a 28 day period, respectively, and they were cultured under CSMH (0.8 - 3.5 mg L-1 dissolved oxygen) for the last 14 days of the experiment. P. vannamei supplemented with 75 mg kg(-1) GSH showed significantly improved survival and growth performance under CSMH compared with the CSMH condition alone. The dose of 75 mg kg(-1) GSH completely eliminated overproduction of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde to suppress serious histopathological lesions and improve bacterial diversity and the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Rhodobacteraceae, thereby preventing pathogen (e.g., Vibrio) invasion in the intestine of shrimp under CSMH. However, the dose of 150 mg kg(-1) GSH was excessive, as it led to serious impairment of survival and growth. These results indicate that 75 mg kg(-1) GSH has the potential to control shrimp mortality and growth inhibition under CSMH in the shrimp farm setting.

AB Lake Baikal's ecosystem is among the oldest lacustrine ecosystems on the planet with a diverse and unique flora and fauna. Amphipods (Amphipoda, Crustacea) are one of the most diverse groups among the lake's invertebrate animals. The lake contains more than 350 species and subspecies of amphipods, and each of these species play a significant role in the lake's food webs. However, their relationships with microorganisms are poorly investigated, which leaves gaps in understanding the relations between aquatic crustaceans and bacteria. We studied the diversity of a specific group of culturable microorganisms (Actinobacteria), and their possible relations with deepwater endemic amphipods present in Lake Baikal. We found that while 73% of the isolated strains belong to the widely distributed genus of Streptomyces, 27% of the isolates belong to rare genera such as Amycolatopsis, Micromonospora, and Pseudonocardia. Fifty-three percent of the studied strains expressed antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria and possess polyketide synthase (PKS) genes. Thus, Actinobacteria associated with Baikal's endemic deepwater amphipods might both protect amphipods against pathogenic microorganisms and be an untapped source of new natural products with biosynthetic potential.

AB Zoo environments represent a useful opportunity for animal research, particularly for species that are difficult to observe in the wild. Moreover, studying the behavior of zoo-housed populations provides important information about the welfare state of animals. We described the behaviors of a zoo-housed population of seven Broad-snouted Caimans (Caiman lanrostris) composed of males and females of different ages. We evaluated the associations of behavior frequencies with attributes of individuals (sex and age class) and with environmental variables (season, time of the day, and daily mean temperature). We calculated the Spread of Participation Index to estimate the use of space in relation to attributes of individuals and environmental variables. Additionally, we evaluated the suitability of the enclosure and management measures by assessing the Five Freedoms. The results showed higher frequencies of aquatic behaviors in adults than in subadults, which may reflect an ontogenetic shift in behavior or, conversely, may be a consequence of a dominance hierarchy. There were almost no differences in behavior frequencies between sexes. Aquatic behaviors were associated with lower temperatures, which could be attributed to thermoregulation. The results also showed daily movements from water in the morning to land at midday and in the afternoon. A high rate of agonistic behaviors was recorded, and possible causes and implications are discussed. Enclosure use was low, with some zones being poorly used or not used at all, and with marked variability among individuals. Finally, 53% of the husbandry recommendations for this species were met in the study population.

AB The relative importance of stochastic- and niche-based processes shifts during successional time and across different types of habitats. Microbial biofilms are known to undergo such successional shifts. However, little is known about the interaction between these successional trajectories and habitat filters. Harsh habitat filters could affect biofilm successional trajectories by strengthening niche-based processes and weakening stochastic processes. We used mesocosms to track successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab (Pachygrapsus transversus). We followed replicated microbial communities under strong and weak habitat filters associated with the crab's gut and carapace. For bacteria, colonization of the crab's gut is constrained by strong chemical and physical filtering, while the carapace remains relatively open for colonization. Consistent with successional models of bacterial biofilms, carapace microbial communities initially converged in community composition at day 8 and diverged thereafter. We expected gut microbial communities to deviate from the trajectory in the carapace and converge towards a subset of tolerant species. Instead, bacterial communities in the gut exhibited low richness, unchanging similarity in composition and turnover in species identities throughout the duration of our study. These habitat filter effects were linked with weak species interactions and low influence from colonization in the gut. If these findings are representative of differences in filter strength in a continuum of successional trajectories, habitat filters may provide basis for predictions that link successional models and habitat types.

AB Continuous livestock grazing can have negative effects on biodiversity and landscape function in arid and semi-arid rangelands. Alternative grazing management practices, such as rotational grazing, may be a viable option for broad-scale biodiversity conservation and sustainable pastoral management. This study compared ground cover, plant species composition and floristic and functional diversity along gradients of grazing intensity between a pastoral property rotationally grazed by goats and an adjacent nature reserve (ungrazed by commercial livestock) in semi-arid south-eastern Australia. Understorey plant species composition differed significantly between the rotationally grazed property and the nature reserve, with a greater proportion and frequency of palatable species recorded in the nature reserve. Understorey plant species richness, diversity, functional biodiversity measures and ground cover declined with increasing grazing pressure close to water points under commercial rotational grazing management. However, at a whole-paddock scale, there were few differences in plant biodiversity and ground cover between the rotationally grazed property and the nature reserve, despite differences in overall plant species composition. Flexible, adaptive, rotational grazing should be investigated further for its potential to achieve both socio-economic and biodiversity conservation outcomes in semi-arid rangelands to complement existing conservation reserves.

AB Grasslands are extensively distributed in flatland areas around the world, such as the Pampas in South America. It is one of the most economically productive landscapes and, as in other regions, they are being replaced by forests at increasing rates. Soil salinization emerges as a negative consequence associated with water deficit and forest groundwater consumption (similar to 250-500 mm/yr, in this region). An assessment of forest groundwater consumption is crucial for risk evaluation of soil salinization on flatland environments. For this aim, numerical modeling based on physical/biological processes and atmospheric boundary conditions was successfully applied in monitored grassland and afforested plots. Modeling results suggested a partial hydraulic disconnection between forest and phreatic aquifer due to the presence of petrocalcic horizons. Forest transpiration estimates were approximately 13% of total groundwater usage. Forest water consumption was then restricted to that soil portions above the petrocalcic horizons. Estimated forest transpiration rates (similar to 723 mm/yr) were similar to and even exceeded those reported in salinized sites with similar features. However, the risk of salinization of these soils was unlikely, because forest transpiration was restricted to the upper soil portions filled with fresh rainwater. The petrocalcic horizon retained water and prevented both deep drainage and, indirectly, soil salinization.

AB Knowledge of species richness and distribution of African biodiversity comes primarily from fauna studies, despite the tremendous richness of the flora. The genus Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) is one of the most diverse plant genera, and shows a great diversity across Africa. This genus is the largest endemic plant radiation in Angola, including 82 native species with a large diversity of life forms (e.g. herbs, shrubs and trees, and several succulent species) 61% of which are endemics. Considering the great diversity of species, habitats and climatic conditions of Angola, this study aims to: (i) update the inventory of the Euphorbia in this country; (ii) investigate the distribution of these species in the Koppen-Geiger climatic regions, WWF ecoregions, and within the protected areas network; and (iii) use these new findings to devise future conservation programs to protect Angola's high plant diversity. Our results revealed that there are 49 endemic Euphorbia species (54 endemic taxa) in Angola, most of which occur in the extensive Miombo woodlands, although some species are restricted to the arid zones of southern Angola. The representation of Euphorbia endemics in protected areas was low, with Iona National Park and the Partial Reserve of Namibe showing the best potential for species protection. Centres of diversity and endemism were found in Serra da Chela (Huila province) and the Angolan Kaokoveld Desert (Namibe province) and must be considered of conservation importance. A re-evaluation of Angola's protected areas network might be required to facilitate and promote effective conservation of the unique plant diversity of the country.

AB Seasonal variations in environmental factors, such as precipitation, influence plant phenology and the relative importance of each factor, differ according to the ecosystem in question. In this study, we evaluated the phenology of 60 tree species in a seasonal semi-deciduous forest located at the southern border of the tropical zone (23 degrees 26 ' 35"S and 51 degrees 15 ' 30"W) during 3 years. We aimed to investigate the relationship of leaf fall, leaf flushing, budding, flowering, immature and mature fruit phenophases with precipitation, temperature and photoperiod. We also analyzed whether the phenological patterns of tree community were seasonal and similar between consecutive years. Although the climate of the region is classified as Cfa, there are two distinct season: a hot humid summer and a cold drier winter. Leaf fall occurred predominantly in the dry season, with leaf flushing and flowering at the end of the dry and early wet season. The mature fruits were observed throughout the year. For the six phenophases analyzed, the percentage of species did not differ among the three study years. The tree community presented, in general, weakly seasonal phenological patterns, mainly in response to variations in temperature and photoperiod. The mature fruits showed seasonal patterns when the species were grouped by dispersal syndrome. This predictability suggests that small inter-annual variations in precipitation and temperature are not relevant for the studied tree species' phenology.

AB A model is proposed to understand the dynamics in a food chain (one predator-two prey). Unlike many approaches, we consider mutualism (for defense against predators) between the two groups of prey. We investigate the conditions for coexistence and exclusion. Unlike Elettreby's (2009) results, we show that prey can coexist in the absence of predators (as expected since there is no competition between prey). We also show the existence of Hopf bifurcation and limit cycle in the model, and numerically present bifurcation diagrams in terms of mutualism and harvesting. When the harvest is practiced for profit making, we provide the threshold effort value xi 0 that determines the profitability of the harvest. We show that there is zero profit when the constant effort xi 0 is applied. Below (resp. above) xi 0, there will always be gain (resp. loss). In the case of gain, we provide the optimal effort xi* and optimal steady states that produce maximum profit and ensure coexistence. Recommendations for resource managers As a result of our investigation, we bring the following to the attention of management: In the absence of predators, different groups of prey can coexist if they mutually help each other (no competition among them). There is a maximal effort xi 0 to invest in order to gain profit from the harvest. Above xi 0, the investment will result in a loss. In the case of profit from harvest, policy makers should recommend the optimal effort xi* to be applied and the optimal stock (x1*,x2*,y*) to harvest. This will guarantee maximum profit while ensuring sustainability of all species. 1.2.3.

AB Question What are the differences between plant communities recognised using supervised versus un-supervised methods? Location Northeastern Australia. Methods Two classifications of savanna plant communities were formed independently with two different approaches: supervised and un-supervised (using agglomerative hierarchical clustering). Each approach used the same vegetation datasets and, importantly, classification criteria. The communities occur on two different landscapes, with differing environmental gradients, covering an area of 53,500 km(2). We compared the internal characteristics of plant communities between approaches and landscapes using four evaluation criteria: identifiability, distinctiveness, similarity of internal heterogeneity and predictability of species foliage cover. Additionally, we compared the central floristic concepts and compositional boundaries of communities identified by each approach. Results Supervised and un-supervised approaches recognised similar floristic community concepts. Compositional boundaries between communities were similar on the landscape with steeper environmental gradients but significantly different on the landscape with gradual environmental gradients. However, communities distinguished using supervised methods were significantly less distinct and identifiable, worse at predicting species foliage cover and significantly more variable in species composition than those identified using un-supervised methods. Conclusions Using supervised rather than un-supervised approaches to distinguish plant communities can result in less recognisable communities, possibly reducing their usefulness for land management planning. Importantly, we found a large disparity between the two approaches in delineating compositional boundaries between communities on landscapes with gradual environmental gradients. This is particularly relevant to communities in biomes such as the savanna which comprises 20% of the Earth's landmass. Ecologists can be more confident using a supervised approach on landscapes with steep environmental gradients but should target landscapes with gradual environmental gradients for un-supervised classification.

AB BackgroundSavanna grasslands are globally important ecosystems consisting of one of the most extensive grazing lands with unique biodiversity. The objectives of the study were to assess the effect of grazing intensity on grassland ecosystem condition, herbaceous plant biomass production, and nutritional content of selected grass species.MethodsThe study was conducted at Chagni Ranch, Northwest Ethiopia. Four transects to water source point at regular intervals of 20m between sampling plots along transects were used for data collection. The distance between the four transects was 200m in radius. Data were collected on grass composition, basal cover, litter cover, number of seedlings, and age distribution of dominant grasses (i.e., young, medium, or old in terms of stage of maturity), soil condition in terms of soil compaction, and soil erosion linked to the effects of trampling by grazing animals along transects (hereafter referred to as transect) to water source point. The total sample size for grass species was 160 plots. The grassland ecosystem condition, herbaceous biomass, and grass nutritional content were used as response variables linked to transect from water source point. The effects of transect on grassland ecosystem condition scores and grass nutritional content were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA).ResultsGrassland condition factors like grass composition, basal cover, litter cover, age distribution of dominant grasses, and soil condition were significantly (P<0.05) higher for the furthest transect to water source point than nearest transect. Out of the 28 identified herbaceous species, grasses accounted for 64.3% of the herbaceous community. Within grass species, about 55.6% were highly desirable in terms of palatability and grazing value (as most palatable species are susceptible to heavy grazing intensity). The results showed a significantly (P<0.05) higher proportion of perennial grasses at the furthest transect to water source point than nearest transect. The dry matter yield at the furthest transect (TD4) and third transect (TD3) were significantly (P<0.05) higher than the nearest transect to water source point (i.e., the first transect (TD1) and second transect (TD2)). Ash, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and acid detergent lignin contents of Cynodon dactylon, Sporobolus pyramidalis, and Digitaria ternata were significantly (P<0.05) higher at the furthest transect to water source point than nearest transect. Grazing intensity had no significant effect on the crude protein content of Cynodon dactylon and Sporobolus pyramidalis at different transects.ConclusionsThe results showed that the furthest transect to water source point were in good condition. Grass biomass production and the nutritional contents of grasses were higher for the furthest transect to water source point. The results suggested that increased grazing intensity towards water source point greatly reduced the abundance of desirable perennial grasses and the sustainability of grassland for livestock production.

AB Understanding the multiplicity of processes producing genetic patterns in natural populations can shed light on the ecology and evolution of species, and help guide effective management and conservation strategies. Here we investigated the role of environmental, demographic, and geographic factors in shaping the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation of the intertidal barnacle Notochthamalus scabrosus along the central-northern coast of Chile (28-34 degrees S). We analyzed genetic data from 7 microsatellite loci genotyped for 300 individuals sampled from 10 sites and combined this information with 8 site-specific environmental (4), demographic (2), and geographic (2) variables using least squares linear regressions, generalized linear models, and matrix regression analyses. We found a strong association between the spatially structured genetic diversity of N. scabrosus and patterns of temporal variability in chlorophyll a, and among-site differences in seawater temperature and adult abundance. Our results illustrate that population size, partly driven by recruitment success, can leave a signal on genetic structure of this highly dispersive marine species. The significant effect of temperature and chlorophyll a stresses that local adaptation may be key to understanding the spatial genetic structure of our model species. Hence, the results of this work represent an advance towards understanding the usually complex causal relationships between environmental variables, gene flow, and genetic diversity patterns of coastal populations.

AB Management impacts and natural events can produce ecosystem state changes that are difficult to reverse. In such cases, a detailed understanding of drivers, thresholds, and feedback mechanisms are needed to design restoration interventions. The Caldenal ecoregion in central Argentina has undergone widespread state change, and restoration is urgently needed, but as yet there has been no knowledge synthesis to support restoration actions. In this paper, we provide evidence-based guidelines for ecological restoration of the Caldenal forest derived from a general to local conceptual understanding of ecosystem dynamics. We develop a Caldenal forest state transition model based on a generalized fire-mediated savanna-woodland transition model. The generalized model depicts global similarities in fire-grass feedback loops as a primary factor controlling savanna to woodland transition ( thicketization) in semiarid savannas around the world. An open forest is considered to be the reference state of the Caldenal that developed under a historical regime of frequent low-intensity fire. The introduction of large livestock herds in the region disrupted the positive tire-grass feedback loop and increased dispersal and recruitment of Prosopis caldenia, creating conditions for thicketization of the forest Controlled, low-intensity fire can be used to build the resilience of an open forest state. Restoring open forest states from woodland states requires a large-scale selective thinning and pruning operation. Long-term restoration requires breaking the positive livestock-thicketization - high-intensity fire feedback and reestablishing the positive grass-low intensity fire feedback to ensure the persistence of a restored open forest state.

TI Monitoring consumptive resource use i n South African national parks
SO KOEDOE
LA English
DT Article
ID FISHERIES; SCALE; CAPE
AB Monitoring is an essential component of measuring the performance of protected areas. This requirement led to the development of a biodiversity monitoring system for South African National Parks (SANParks). The system comprises of ten major programmes, each focusing on a core area of conservation biodiversity monitoring, with resource use being one of the focal areas. With the growing appreciation of the importance of natural resources for the socioeconomic well-being of communities and other stakeholders, sustainable resource use is an important component of the management of natural areas and national parks. To gauge sustainability, a sound monitoring and research programme that fits within the context of the SANParks' adaptive management approach towards social-ecological system management is required. The purpose of this article was to define the context and scope in which consumptive resource use takes place within SANParks and to outline the criteria necessary for developing a sound monitoring programme to assess the sustainability of such use. The monitoring programme is structured in view of the fact that sustainable resource use is achievable only where all dimensions of sustainability (social, economic and ecological) are considered simultaneously. In terms of the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, the programme provides for assessing stakeholder needs, trends in resource use and the social and economic impacts of resource use. Monitoring that relates to the ecological dimension of sustainability of biological resource use deals with the rate of turnover and population dynamics of target species, as well as harvest impact. In terms of abiotic (non-renewable) resources, monitoring deals with sound management practices to minimise impact on the environment, and to optimise benefits through responsible use.
   Conservation implications: The resource use monitoring programme is intended to ensure that monitoring relating to the harvesting of natural resources from national parks is scientifically sound and conducted in a structured way, towards meeting the objective of sustainable use and compliance with national legislation. The article illustrates how SANParks meets its obligation to monitor biodiversity conservation while at the same time meeting the needs for the consumptive use of resources.

AB Background and Aims: Michoacan is a state with high biodiversity. Taxonomic studies estimate that there are 30 to 37 species of oak in the state; however, there is scarce information about their distribution patterns. In this study, the geographic and ecological distribution patterns of the genus, and its two sections, composed of 33 species (1734 records), were analyzed at municipality level; topographic, climatic, edaphic, and ecological data are included.
   Methods: Indices of richness, rarity and irreplaceability were calculated to obtain the distribution patterns at the municipal level of genus and both sections. Cluster analyses were performed to identify patterns of geographic, ecologic and elevational distribution of the species. It was tested whether any environmental gradient explains the distributional patterns.
   Key results: The highest specific richness of the Quercus genus is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS), where humid and subhumid temperate environments are prevalent; the highest rareness occurred in the east-northeast of the TMVB. With respect to elevation, section Quercus shows larger distribution ranges than section Lobatae. Based on elevation, the oaks can be classified into low (600-1900 m a.s.l.) and high mountains (2000-3100 m a.s.l.) with a strong turnover of species between 1900-2000 m a.s.l. Five groups of species are identified, based on their environmental similarity, which coincide with physiographic regions.
   Conclusions: The municipal richness of oaks is correlated with topographic and aridity heterogeneity at the generic level, mainly in the Lobatae section. Considering that greater environmental heterogeneity corresponds to a greater diversity of species, it is recommended to increase the sampling effort in municipalities that have greater environmental heterogeneity. Intensive fieldwork in the SMS is suggested. There are still unresolved taxonomic problems that should be studied in detail.

AB BackgroundOver the last two decades there has been an increase in the demand for land in Sub Saharan Africa, particularly from foreign agribusiness investment to provide food for an increasing human population. The majority of land outside of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa is under customary tenure. Due to poor land administration in the region, communities living in undocumented land areas tend to be at greater risk of eviction from increasing liberalisation of land markets. To prevent local displacement and disturbance to investment caused by land disputes tenure clarification is growing in importance on national and international agendas. Land conversion can fragment wildlife habitat while reducing the suitable range areas of terrestrial mammal populations on the continent. Simultaneously illegal hunting is on the rise for a wide variety of taxa driven by a demand for food and income from the sale of animal products. To enable a better understanding of how land tenure arrangements impact upon spatial variations in illegal hunting, this protocol sets out the parameters for an evidence map which will collate and analyse the spatially explicit quantitative evidence that exists showing the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of focus as it contains the highest number of terrestrial mammals listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taking stock of what methods have been used to gather data and where evidence exists can guide future research in this area while informing conservation interventions.MethodsThis evidence map will compare: (1) data availability on the spatial distribution of illicit hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals across different land tenure regimes in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) research methodologies that have primarily been used to collect quantitative data on illegal hunting and comparability of existing data; (3) preferences in the research body toward particular taxa and geographical areas, (4) the evidence map will provide an analysis on the influence other environmental and anthropogenic determinants that influence the spatial distribution of illicit hunting incidences, e.g., proximity to roads, water bodies, range patrol bases etc. Eight academic databases and numerous organisation repositories will be searched for relevant studies by three authors. Double screening will be carried out on all articles to locate studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria, for inclusion studies must contain spatially explicit quantitative data on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Relevant information from studies will be extracted to a custom-made extraction form. The resulting map will consist of a narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and a heat map in the form of a matrix. By providing an overview of the evidence base the resulting map can inform future meta-analyses by showing where there is sufficient comparable data while guiding conservation interventions by indicating geographical areas where species are most at risk.

AB Predicting ecological responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanisms that influence species' tolerances to temperature. Based on the idea that air and water breathing animals are differentially suited to life in either medium due to differences in their respiratory morphology, we examined the possibility that the thermal tolerances of coexisting intertidal pulmonate and patellogastropod limpets may differ in different breathing media. We tested this by determining each species' median lethal temperature (LT50) and cardiac Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) as measures of upper thermal tolerance limits, in air and water. Although all these species can survive in air and water, we hypothesised that the pulmonate limpets, Siphonaria capensis and S. serrata, would have higher thermal limits than the patellogastropod limpets, Cellana capensis and Scutellastra granularis, in air and vice versa in water. The results did not support our hypotheses, since C. capensis had similar thermal tolerance limits to the pulmonate limpets in air and the pulmonate limpets had thermal tolerance limits similar to or higher than S. granularis in water. Thus, considering pulmonate and patellid limpets as groups, we found no differences in their collective upper thermal tolerance limits in either medium. We conclude that differences between these two limpet groups in their respiratory morphology do not influence thermal tolerance, but that tolerances are species-specific.

AB Thalattosuchian crocodiles belonging to the taxon Metriorhynchidae are among the first fossil reptiles ever discovered. Taxa belonging to this morphologically distinctive, stratigraphically long-lived, and widely spread group were described long before Richard Owen in 1841 coined the term "dinosaur" (e.g., Geosaurus giganteus described by von Soemmerring in 1814). Here we describe a new find of a Tyrannoneustes cf. lythrodectikos skull from the Callovian (late Middle Jurassic) of the Weser-Wiehengebirge (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). This species represents one of the oldest and most basal macrophagous metriorhynchines known to date. The new find is one of the most complete Tyrannoneustes skulls with both the cranium and the mandible found in association. It shows most of the autapomorphies typical of Tyrannoneustes lythrodectikos, some of which are not as distinctive as in the holotype. Additionally, it shows several characters of "Metriorhynchus" brachyrhynchus. Unfortunately, the current stage of publication leaves Metriorhynchus as a polyphyletic taxon that needs a proper redescription. The new specimen shows characters of both species, with slight variations that are too little to create a new species. Therefore, the specimen found near Munster was assigned to Tyrannoneustes cf. lythrodectikos. Several characters indicate a subadult ontogenetic stage for the specimen, consistent with its relatively small size compared with other Tyrannoneustes individuals.

AB Background and aims - Cola, the second largest genus of the Malvaceac-Sterculioideae comprises 100-135 small to large tree species confined in nature to African forests, though cultivated elsewhere. Current species distribution ranges show that the genus is highly diverse in the seasonally wet forests along the Nigeria-Cameroon border, including the Korup National Park (KNP). In this paper we examine the diversity and abundance of Cola in KNP compared to other forests for which comparable data arc available. We also describe two novelties in the genus.
   Methods - We used inventory data from a 50-ha permanent plot in southern KNP where all Cola trees and saplings down to 1 cm in diameter were tagged, mapped and identified. Additional collections of the genus came from the 11 km trail leading to the plot. Classic herbariwn techniques and field observations were used for the morphological identification and description of specimens at MO and YA and from our personal collections. Cola species richness and abundance was estimated from the plot data and compared to other African forest sites for which comparable data arc available. The evaluation of the conservation status of the two new species described in this paper followed the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.
   Key results - Twenty-five species of Cola were identified in the southern part of the KNP, including four undescribed species, raising the total number of Cola species in Cameroon to 46. The abundance of the genus in KNP was three orders of magnitude higher than in the Rabi forest in southwestern Gabon or in the Ituri forest in eastern D.R. Congo. This high species richness and abundance suggests that KNP is part of the center of diversity of the genus. Two new species, Cola zemagoana Kenfack & D.W.Thomas and C mamboana Kenfack & Sainge are described and illustrated. Both species are only known from the lowland rainforest of southwestern Cameroon. Cola zemagoana is narrow endemic of southern KNP and its conservation status is assessed as Endangered. Cola mamboana is confined to the lowland forests of southwestern Cameroon, is locally very abundant in protected areas and is also assigned the conservation status Endangered.

AB Evolutionary biologists have long been intrigued by exaggerated morphologies tied to sexual or natural selection. In insects, relatively few studies have investigated the evolution of such traits at the genus level and above and have used comparative phylogenetic methods to do so. We here investigate the interspecific evolution of head length in the minute litter bug genus Nannocoris Reuter based on the first phylogenetic hypothesis of the group (25 ingroup species, five gene regions, 3409 bp) and ancestral state reconstruction. Head lengths in this speciose genus range from approximately one sixth of the total body length to more than a quarter of the body length, while the head and mouthpart (rostrum) lengths are correlated. Different species therefore possess a markedly different reach of the rostrum when extended. The analyses show that head length evolution in Nannocoris is plastic, with head length elongations and reductions occurring in several clades, derived from ancestors with moderately elongated heads. Evidence is provided that exaggerated head lengths evolved through elongation of either the genal (pricei group) or the tip (arimensis group) region of the head. The biology of species in the genus Nannocoris is unknown, but given the lack of sexual dimorphism of head lengths, we speculate that head evolution in this genus may be driven by natural selection, potentially in the context of prey capture.

AB The recent inclusion of communities of planktonic algae and microbial crusts into the system of European vegetation types is critically discussed. It is argued that formal vegetation classification should be limited to plant taxa represented by macroscopic individuals within a plot, including all vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, charophyta and macrophytic chlorophyta, rhodophyta or phaeophyta. In the interest of comparability and methodological stringency, all microscopic algae and all prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria, and the habitats dominated by such microorganisms (e.g. plankton, biofilms and crusts), should be excluded from vegetation classification.

AB Population structure and genetic diversity of invasions are the result of evolutionary processes such as natural selection, drift and founding events. Some invasions are also molded by specific human activities such as selection for cultivars and intentional introduction of desired phenotypes, which can lead to low genetic diversity in the resulting invasion. We investigated the population structure, diversity and origins of a species with both accidental and intentional introduction histories, as well as long-term selection as a cultivar. Dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria; Brassicaceae) has been used as a dye source for at least eight centuries in Eurasia, was introduced to eastern USA in the 1600s, and is now considered invasive in the western USA. Our analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) from 645 plants from the USA and Eurasia did not find significantly lower gene diversity (H-j) in the invaded compared to the native range. This suggests that even though the species was under cultivation for many centuries, human selection of plants may not have had a strong influence on diversity in the invasion. We did find significantly lower genetic differentiation (F-st)in the invasive range but our results still suggested that there are two distinct invasions in the western USA. Our data suggest that these invasions most likely originated from Switzerland, Ukraine and Germany, which correlates with initial biological control agent survey findings. Genetic information on population structure, diversity and origins assists in efforts to control invasive species, and continued combination of ecological and molecular analyses will help bring us closer to sustainable management of plant invasions.

AB As global landscapes continue to change, the sustainability of the ecosystem services they support are increasingly coming into question. In the rapidly changing neotropics, multiple-use plants epitomize sources of ecosystem services. To sustain the relationship that exists between such plants and human populations, a sound understanding of their well-being is required.
   Density data on multiple-use plants were compared across forest types and land tenure classes to understand the implications of these two spatial frames of reference for landscape sustainability.
   The density of an aggregate sample of seventeen multiple-use and a sub-sample of five species were examined relative to forest type and land tenure class across fourteen Rupununi, Southern Guyana, study sites. The examination of plant density based on the two sample sizes was used to make inferences on how the two frames of reference may impact landscape sustainability.
   The mean density of the aggregate sample was highest in three of six forest types, but showed no statistical difference across land tenure classes. When individual species were considered mean densities showed no statistical difference across land tenure classes, but differences were observed for three species across forest types. Mean densities were highest in forest types within which swidden agriculture occurs and in the protected area where logging is prohibited.
   Our findings suggested that in changing tropical landscapes plant species distribution can be predicted by forest types, but land tenure classes may provide clearer signals as to where a species well-being and hence ecosystem services may be compromised.

AB In the face of the current changes in land use and climate as well as habitat destruction, it is important to study herbaceous vegetation as an indicator of changes occurring in savanna ecosystems. We investigated the effects of climate, land use and habitat, both alone and in combination, on the diversity and occurrence of West African savanna herbaceous plant communities. Floristic data and environmental variables were sampled in Burkina Faso and subjected to ordination and indicator species analysis to explore the variation in nine vegetation types. Regression analyses showed that climate, land use, humidity gradient, soil fraction and vegetation structure discriminate herbaceous plant communities. Climate, habitat and their interaction had the greatest effect on the occurrence of these communities. Changes in species richness of the studied communities were mainly due to climate, land use and their interaction, which were more important for increasing rather than decreasing diversity. In all cases, climate conditions remained the most important environmental factor driving vegetation variation in West African savannas. Beside this, the effects of habitat degradation in interaction with land use and climatic conditions indicate land use to be a threat for the diversity of the herbaceous vegetation.

AB Crocodiles have been hunted and consumed for centuries for skins, nutrients, and medicines. These indomitable trends have overpowered restrictions from wildlife and conservation agencies, continuing the illegal trades of crocodiles across the world. This paper described the development of a very stable, fast, and secured polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay for the confirmed detection of Crocodylus porosus under any matrices and decomposing treatments. Two very short-sites (77 and 127-bp) of atp6 and cytb genes of C. porosus were controlled digested with AciI enzyme; producing distinctive RFLP patterns (83, 54, 44 & 23bp). The enzyme digested assay was stable following extreme boiling, autoclaving, and microwaving treatments that break down DNA. The sensitivity was tested and validated in model meatballs and it was suitable for detecting 0.01% crocodile meatball matrices. The optimized RFLP assay was used to screen 3 commercial meatballs and 21 traditional medicines (TM). While no crocodile DNA was found in commercial chicken meatballs, 4/21 TM products were found correctly labelled to contain C. porosus DNA. The novel assay demonstrated sufficient merit to be used by regulatory agencies for any forensic and/or archaeological identification of C. porosus even under the state of decomposition.

AB The role of competition in structuring plant communities has recently entered a new phase by considering interactions with pollinators. In this issue of Journal of Vegetation Science, Fantinato etal. show that co-occurring grassland plants tend to use different pollinators or diverge in anther morphology. The study opens the door for investigation of the ecological and evolutionary processes that generate this pattern.

AB Semantic heterogeneity hampers efforts to find, integrate, analyse and interpret ecological data. An application case-study is described, in which the objective was to automate the integration and interpretation of heterogeneous, flower-visiting ecological data. A prototype knowledge based system is described and evaluated. The system's semantic architecture uses a combination of ontologies and a Bayesian network to represent and reason with qualitative, uncertain ecological data and knowledge. This allows the high-level context and causal knowledge of behavioural interactions between individual plants and insects, and consequent ecological interactions between plant and insect populations, to be discovered. The system automatically assembles ecological interactions into a semantically consistent interaction network (a new design of a useful, traditional domain model). We discuss the contribution of probabilistic reasoning to knowledge discovery, the limitations of knowledge discovery in the application case-study, the impact of the work and the potential to apply the system design to the study of ecological interaction networks in general.

AB Communal livestock farming areas adjoining the Greater Kruger National Park Area within South Africa are part of the Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) Protection Zone with Vaccination due to the proximity to wildlife reservoirs. FMD and its control affect the productivity of resource-poor farmers who often depend on livestock for their livelihoods. A cross-sectional study was performed with the objectives to evaluate the perceptions of farmers concerning FMD control, estimate the proportion of cattle with presumed protective antibody titres against FMD, as well as the proportion of herds with adequate herd immunity at the wildlife-livestock interface within Mpumalanga Province. One hundred and four farmers were interviewed with 73% (76/104) being cattle owners and the remainder hired cattle herders. The majority of respondents (79%, 82/104) reported a high level of satisfaction with the current animal health programmes in general. The educational level of the respondents varied by satisfaction level: the median (interquartile range; IQR) education level was standard 9 (2-12) for non satisfied respondents, standard 3 (0-6) for little satisfied and standard 7 (2-11) for very satisfied respondents (P = 0.036). Animals are not always treated at FMD inspections points, but satisfied respondents were more likely to seek veterinary assistance (P = 0.001). The majority of respondents (92%, 96/104) identified the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) as a risk factor for FMD outbreaks. Liquid-phase blocking ELISA antibody titres >= 1.6log(10) were used to indicate positive serology secondary to FMD vaccination. At the time of sampling and relative to this threshold, 23% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12%-34%) of the sampled cattle had positive serology to SAT-1, 41% (95%CI: 33%-48%) to SAT-2 and 29% (95%CI: 19%-39%) to SAT-3. The median (IQR) time between the previous vaccination and sampling was 189 (168-241) days. The sampled cattle had a longer inter-vaccination interval as scheduled by state veterinary services and antibody levels were low at the time of the study. The majority of respondents expressed high satisfaction with the currently applied FMD vaccination programme, which provides an opportunity for progressive adaption of animal health programmes within the study area.

AB Bush encroachment has serious consequences on ecosystem functioning through alteration of species composition and ecosystem productivity. However, little is known regarding the spatial patterning of invading shrubs in semi-arid savannas. Cartesian coordinates of two invading woody species (Vachellia karroo and V. nilotica), were recorded in a 20 x 20-m plot on a grassland at Matopos research station, south-west Zimbabwe. We recorded a total of 308 plants including both saplings and shrubs from the two study plant species. Second-order spatial statistics was applied in order to understand the spatial pattern of encroaching plants. We predicted that the encroaching plants would be spatially aggregated because of facilitation that occurs in harsh environmental conditions. Consistent with our predictions, the two species were aggregated, with no evidence of inter-and intra specific species competition. This study demonstrates that encroaching trees in semi-arid savanna generally do not show self organization during early growth stages.

AB Aerial survey data are widely used to model distribution of wildlife. However, their performance in habitat modelling remains largely untested. We used aerial survey and satellite-linked Global Positioning System (GPS) collar data for elephants, to test (i) whether there is an optimal spatial resolution of predictor variables at which habitat models based on aerial survey data that are uncorrected for locational error can accurately predict elephant habitat and (ii) whether habitat models based on these data sets can accurately predict the presence of elephants in closed woodland habitats. We applied maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to these data sets and used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as distance from water points as the habitat predictors to answer these questions. Our results demonstrate better ability of aerial survey data to predict elephant presence at the coarser spatial resolution of 1000m of both predictor variables. Habitat models derived from aerial survey data underpredicted elephant presence in more closed woodland habitats than those derived from GPS collar data. This result implies that elephants located under dense tree canopies are likely missed during an aerial survey. Our study is one of the first to empirically test and report results on the poor performance of aerial survey data in habitat modelling especially in dense woodlands.

AB Arboreal ants use a variety of plant structures as nesting sites, but may also nest in structures created by arboreal ecosystem engineers. We observed, for the first time, ants using empty cocoons of the economically important silk moth species, Gonometa postica, as shelter and nesting sites. Individual trees and individual cocoons were occupied predominantly by one dominant ant species, although in some cases by co-occurring ant species. Ant abundance and occurrence were positively related to cocoon size and the presence of scale insects on branches of the trees, and negatively influenced by cocoon occupancy by other invertebrates. Ants also preferred cocoons containing only small parasite holes as opposed to cocoons containing large moth emergence holes, suggesting that ants select cocoons based on cocoon characteristics. Further, these results reveal that other arboreal invertebrates appear to benefit from cocoon production. Empty cocoons could be functioning as nest sites and shelters for arboreal invertebrates, and they could create favourable habitats for other invertebrates on Vachellia erioloba. Therefore, G. postica acts as an autogenic ecosystem engineer and current silk harvesting practices, which partly rely on harvesting empty G. postica cocoons, may have potential local and large-scale implications for inter-specific interactions in these arboreal systems.

AB This study examined local people's perceptions of rangeland resources in three communal grasslands of South Africa and compared them with the views of ecologists. A total of 30 households that own livestock and two elder groups (eight elders per group) were selected in each communal area. Local respondents perceived that vegetation change mainly refers to change in species richness, diversity and abundance in vegetation that is not necessarily related to loss of productivity, feed shortage or rangeland degradation (deterioration). However, most ecologists used vegetation change and rangeland degradation synonymously to explain environmental changes. Most respondents regarded abiotic and biotic factors as the primary drivers of vegetation change and degradation, respectively. Respondents also mentioned a third group of factors, termed as 'institutional', which have been overlooked by most ecologists. One group of factors may be more important than the other but we argue that it is difficult to uncouple them to explain the determinants of vegetation change and degradation within the context of the 'commons'. The impact of human settlement expansion on grazing lands was less recognised by the respondents but we believe this poses a threat to rangelands by reducing and fragmenting grazing resources. About 50% of the elders rated the rangeland as being in poor, very poor, good or fair condition. We recommend incorporation of broader studies of farmers' perceptions in conjunction with scientific analyses in order to establish a sound communal-based rangeland development and restoration programme.

AB The Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo area has highly diverse macroalgal assemblages, with a small cespitose growth and juvenile stages of different mollusks. The present work aims to introduce the juvenile stages of limpet-like gastropods and chitons associated with these assemblages in the rocky intertidal zone. The sampling was done during the annual cycle of 2014 (January, May, July and November), 108 samples of macroalgae and associated mollusks were collected in the coastal localities El Palmar beach, municipal dock and the beach parapet of Las Gatas. A total of 472 specimens of mollusks were collected-229 limpet-like gastropods and 243 chitons-belonging to 34 species, 25 of them were already recorded for the Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo area by other authors, as opposed to Fissurella deroyae, F. microtrema and F. spongiosa, which are new records for the area, being previously found only in the Acapulco area. Additionally, Calyptraea conica, Lottia strongiana, Lucapinella callomarginata and Siphonaria brannani are new records for Guerrero, and Crepidula marginalis and Tectura biradiata for the Mexican Pacific. Of the specimens associated with the macroalgae, 91% were juvenile; therefore, the macroalgal assemblage is considered a site for larval establishment and breeding of the studied mollusks.

AB Introduction: Water-based interventions haphazardly introduced in the drylands of Kenya have led to the introduction of piospheres used as concentration mounts. Not much is known about the effect of these piospheres on soil physio-chemical properties, especially in the Kenyan rangelands where the government and other development agencies have created piospheres aimed at curbing water shortages and sustaining livestock production. The study assessed the effect of piospheres on soil physio-chemical characteristics in the southern rangelands of Kajiado, Kenya, in order to provide evidence-based insights that will be useful in guiding future water interventions.
   Methods: Soil samples were collected within 0.25-m(2) plots at 20-m intervals along 100-m transects from three piospheres (a dam, a trough, and a seasonal river). Two-way ANOVA was used to determine if there were significant differences in soil parameters between piospheric distances.
   Results: Soil bulk density significantly different between piospheric distances (F = 22.25, P = 0.001) and piospheres (F = 13.10, P = 0.002), being highest at 20 m from the trough (1.1-1.21 gcm(-3)) relative to a similar distance from the dam (1.01-1.20 gcm(-3)) and the river (1.1-1.17 gcm(-3)). On the other hand, mean soil aggregate stability significantly increased (F = 66.89, P = 0.001) with piospheric distance, being lowest at 20 m from the trough (43.9-46.2%), the dam (43.1-48.9%), and the river (46.6-47.5%).
   Conclusions: High soil bulk density and consequent low soil porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and moisture content demonstrated that grazing was high near the piospheres. It is recommended that livestock should be herded away from the piospheres after drinking water to ensure that grazing livestock spend less time near the piospheres if reduced soil compaction is to be realized. Piospheres should also be better planned and placed at landscape level to exploit landscape heterogeneity.

AB Coastal lagoons of the Ebro Delta (Catalonia, Spain) have been subjected to historical reductions of their hydrological connections with the sea and to freshwater discharges from rice agriculture, with a more recent switch to freshwater inputs from the Ebro River to improve their trophic state. As a result, the seasonal salinity regime in three formerly connected coastal lagoons varies, being polyhaline to oligohaline from May to November but polyhaline in winter. We evaluate the effects of current water management on the abundance and community structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton within the three lagoons and assess the contribution of environmental variables in February and August. Temporal variation evidenced the typical increase in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance from winter to summer. However, contrasting August salinities among lagoons showed opposite effects in the two communities, with higher abundance of total zooplankton and lower abundance of total phytoplankton at higher salinities. Besides, each lagoon displayed distinctive groups of taxa and showed important temporal differences. Temperature and salinity were the most important factors determining the structure of assemblages (ca. 60% and 72% of phytoplankton and zooplankton variance, respectively). Compared to the period of agricultural runoff ca. 30 yrs ago, our results show an important decrease in the overall abundance of phytoplankton (>50%), whereas zooplankton abundances are ca. 6 times higher. However, environmental variability associated with the salinity gradient appears to be responsible for observed changes in the abundance and structure of planktonic assemblages.

AB One of the main steps in road and railway embankment restoration is the spreading of previously removed topsoil, which provides an input of seeds, organic matter and microorganisms and encourages the establishment of a vegetation cover, essential to stabilise the embankment and blend it with the landscape. However, topsoil is a scarce resource, prompting the search for economic alternatives with similar results. The present study compares the results of spreading topsoil with an organic amendment (manure) for the soil's physico-chemical properties, erosion resistance and microbial activity, floristic richness and composition, and bare soil cover. For this purpose, experimental plots with three treatments (Control, Topsoil and Manure) were maintained on a recently built embankment in Central Spain for 20 months. Manure was found to be an effective alternative to topsoil for the improvement of soil fertility (organic matter content and total nitrogen). The two types of organic amendment produced similar reductions in bare soil cover and erosion rates. However, plots with topsoil showed greater soil respiration and species richness and a different floristic composition in comparison to those treated with manure, which was closer to control plots. These results suggest that manure can be used to replace topsoil to enhance embankment stability during the early stages of restoration. However, if the aim of the restoration process is to promote plant diversity, topsoil is recommended.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a high energy-demanding process that may be inhibited by penguin guano. We tested this hypothesis in Ardley Island by measuring BNF in biological soil crusts (BSC) directly within a Penguin Colony and in sites unaffected by penguins. We also explored the effect of adding guano to BSCs in sites free of the influence of penguins. Water availability is also one of the most limiting elements for life in the Antarctica, and we expected that a wetter growing season would stimulate BNF. To evaluate the effect of moisture on BNF, we added water to BSCs under laboratory conditions and estimated BNF by means of the acetylene reduction assay during three growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014), with contrasting temperature and precipitation conditions. The results reveal an almost complete inhibition of N fixation in the BSCs of the Penguin Colony. In sites free of ammonium and phosphate in rainwater, BNF rates reached up to 3 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) during warmer and wetter years. The addition of guano to BSCs significantly inhibited the rates of BNF. In laboratory incubations, the addition of water significantly stimulated rates of BNF during the warmer growing season with more sunshine hours. The likely increases in soil moisture levels due to climate change and glacier melting in the Antarctic Peninsula may enhance the rates of BNF. However, this may be constrained by accompanying changes in the distribution of Penguin Colonies.

AB Background: As riparian habitats are legally protected, they have been maintained even in areas where extensive reforestation by exotic species occurred in areas surrounding riparian environments. However, the extent to which the riparian plant communities have been affected by the replacement of native forest on slopes has rarely been investigated.Aims: In this study, we evaluated the effects of replacement of native forest by Pinus radiata plantations, on the diversity and structure of plant communities of remnant forests preserved in riparian habitats.Methods: We selected five watersheds with native forest and five watersheds where the native forest had been replaced by pine plantations preserving riparian forests and compared composition, diversity and structure of riparian vegetation.Results: In watersheds with pine plantation, riparian forests had lower adult tree density, tree cover, diversity and regeneration and higher shrub cover, diversity of herb species and diversity and richness of exotic species than riparian forests with abutting native forest.Conclusions: The results suggest that the replacement of native forest by pine plantations negatively affects the diversity and structure of riparian forest. However, in other respects (e.g. shrub and climber richness), these habitats are not affected and they contribute significantly to the biodiversity conservation.

AB This paper presents the first detailed assessment of the invasive potential of Melaleuca hypericifolia Sm. in South Africa. This woody, fire-adapted shrub, native to Australia, is considered a high risk invader which could potentially occupy 4% of the country if allowed to spread. As such, it is a listed invader under South African legislation. Melaleuca hypericifolia is known to have naturalised at five sites in the Western and Eastern Cape of South Africa and several introduced but non-spreading populations represent a further risk of invasion. An integrated management approach involving mechanical and chemical control was tested on an invasive population (20.4 ha extent) on Chapman's Peak in Cape Town, Western Cape Province. Management interventions began in 2012 and were repeated annually. The number of reproducing individuals was reduced over the four year period reported on here. The treatment used was shown to be effective as no re-sprouting occurred although some plants were overlooked during clearing operations owing to the density of the surrounding native vegetation. Low detectability presents a major impediment to extirpation of the population despite the distinctive flowers and leaf arrangement of this species. We recommend the use of fire where feasible to increase visibility and stimulate seed germination. We estimate that extirpation of M. hypericifolia from the Chapman's Peak site will be possible with an annual investment of ZAR 10000 over the next 10 years. Uncertainty around the extent of plantings of Melaleuca hypericifolia around the country limits the suitability of the species as a national eradication target. However, based on the invasive risk it poses and given encouraging results from the extirpation effort as shown in this study, we conclude that site-specific extirpation is a feasible management goal for this species.

DE Community structure; Desert; Food-web; Macrodetritivores; Ectothermic
   predators
ID ENERGY-FLOW; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; ISOPOD; DISPERSAL; STRATEGY
AB The classical paradigm describe desert communities as being controlled by abiotic conditions and therefore it was assumed that predation had a limited role in the determination of desert community structure and that only one effective trophic level was expected. In the Negev desert, the desert isopod (Hemilepistus raeumuri) is common in the less productive habitats but almost absent from the more productive wadis. In the present study we tested whether predation by ectothermic predators has a role in controlling isopod populations in wadis. We hypothesized that plant cover provides a refuge for these predators from secondary endothermic predators. We addressed this hypothesis by comparing isopod survivorship with and without predation exclusion, and with and without plant cover removal. Isopods protected from predation had a sustainable population whereas unprotected isopods had an unsustainable sink population. Removal of plant cover did not affect the survivorship of predator-protected isopods, however it did increase the survivorship and reduced predation pressure when not protected from predators, for at least four years. Hence, we conclude that predation controls isopod population and causes an unsustainable sink population in wadis. We have shown that plant cover mediates predation and that some habitats in the desert have an effective third trophic level, suggesting that energy is not the major limiting factor in determining the length of food chains.

AB Documentation of the near-and long-term effects of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, one of the largest environmental disasters in US history, is still ongoing. We used a novel before-after-control-impact analysis to test the hypothesis that average body size of intertidal populations of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) inhabiting impacted areas in Louisiana decreased due to increased stress/mortality related to the oil spill. Time-averaged death assemblages of oysters were used to establish a pre-spill baseline of body-size structure for four impacted and four control locations along a 350km stretch of Louisiana's coastline. Post-spill body sizes were then measured from live oysters at each site in order to evaluate the differences in body size between oiled (i.e. impact) and unoiled (i.e. control) locations before and after the spill. Our results indicate that average body size of oysters remained relatively unchanged after the oil spill. There were also no temporal patterns in temperature, salinity or disease prevalence that could have explained our results. Together, these findings suggest that oysters either recovered rapidly following the immediate impact of the DWH oil spill, or that its impact was not severe enough to influence short-term population dynamics of the oyster beds.

AB This study explores the impact of browsers on vegetation types within the Mapungubwe National Park and specifically whether rocky outcrops or ridges in the park serve as refugia from browsers, particularly elephants. We sampled 80 transects at 20 sites and recorded 1740 plants comprising 65 species. We found that a high proportion (> 80%) of the woody vegetation sampled indicated browser utilisation. Although certain woody species (e.g. Albizia harveyi, Boscia albitrunca, Lannea schweinfurthii) appeared to be preferred by browsers, browsing levels were relatively high among all woody species. High levels of browsing by herbivores other than elephants suggest that they have a significant impact on the park's vegetation. We did not find that rocky ridges acted as refugia to browsers, but instead found that vegetation in rocky ridges was more severely impacted by browsers than vegetation in flat areas, despite vegetation being more accessible in flat areas. If elephant numbers continue to increase at the current rate (e.g. elephant numbers doubled between 2007 and 2010), we predict that some of the heavily utilised species will become locally rare over time.
   Conservation implications: High levels of browsing by both elephant and smaller herbivores contribute to significant impacts on vegetation away from rivers in Mapungubwe National Park. Without management interventions that address both types of impact, structural and species diversity are bound to decrease over the short to medium term.

AB Monitoring the movement and distribution of wildlife is a critical tool of an adaptive management framework for wildlife conservation. We installed motion-triggered cameras to capture the movement of mammals through two purpose-built migration gaps in an otherwise fenced conservancy in northern Kenya. We compared the results to data gathered over the same time period (1 Jan 2011-31 Dec 2012) by the human observers monitoring mammal tracks left at the same fence gaps in a sandy loam detection strip. The camera traps detected more crossing events, more species and more individuals of each species per crossing event than did the human track observers. We tested for volume detection differences between methods for the five most common species crossing each gap and found that all detection rates were heavily weighted towards the camera-trap method. We review some of the discrepancies between the methods and conclude that although the camera traps record more data, the management of that data can be time-consuming and ill-suited to some time-sensitive decision-making. We also discuss the importance of daily track monitoring for adaptive management conservation and community security.

AB White seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, is an important coastal resource throughout both California and Baja California, but whether this species comprises a single or multiple subpopulations in the northeastern Pacific is not known. The aim of this study was to infer larval rearing habitats and population structure of white seabass by sampling adults from three regions spanning a latitudinal temperature gradient and a distance of over 1000 km, and analyzing the isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of otolith aragonite corresponding to the larval, juvenile and adult stages. Otolith cores revealed high isotopic variability and no significant differences among regions, suggesting overlapping rearing conditions during the larval stage, the potential for long distance dispersal or migration or selective mortality of larvae at higher temperatures. Back-calculated temperatures of aragonite precipitation derived using regional salinity-delta(w) relationships and local salinity estimates also did not differ significantly. However, there were significant differences between the delta O-18 values of the first seasonal growth ring of age 0 fish as well as back calculated aragonite precipitation temperatures, suggesting the presence of two potentially discrete subpopulations divided by Punta Eugenia (27 degrees N) along the central Baja California peninsula. These findings are consistent with regional oceanographic patterns and are critical for understanding white seabass population structure, and provide information needed for the implementation of appropriate management strategies.

AB Some of the most productive taxa for forestry are interspecific F-1 hybrids grown as exotics in the tropics and subtropics. Attributes of resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural establishment of both F-1 hybrids (n = 3) and advanced generation hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi. Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F-1 trees at the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of a seed crop from one F-1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F-1 in some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C henryi parent is favoured (60%), whereas selfing (10%) and crossing with other F-1 (30%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably accounted for long distance dispersal from C torelliana, but this mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from the F-1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour, controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the planted F-1 hybrid. If large sources of F-1 pollen become available to compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival inhibits on-going gene flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pest management requires the development of robust monitoring tools. In Italy, coypu Myocastor coypus (nutria) have been controlled since the early 1990s, but the effectiveness of these measures has never been tested. With the aim of developing a reliable and volunteer-based method for the long-term monitoring of coypu abundance in agricultural landscapes, we calibrated an index based on surveys for coypu paths against density estimates obtained through a standardized mark-recapture technique. Two trapping sessions were performed in winter for each of 12 1-km long stretches of irrigation canals and watercourses using 15 baited cage traps. Trapping sessions lasted 7 days each, with a 10-day break between sessions. Population size was assessed using three methods: Peterson-Lincoln's formula, capwire estimators and accumulation curves. Active coypu paths and five habitat variables were recorded by walking on the edge of both banks. The variables were then related to population size (y) by means of multi-regressive models, testing for the predictive power of the selected models by leave-one-out cross-validation. Multi-regressive models included only the number of coypu paths with the best performances achieved by the model based on Peterson-Lincoln formula, supporting path count as an effective method to assess the abundance of the coypu in agricultural landscapes. Concurrently, to assess the field suitability of the indirect method, surveys for coypu paths were carried out on 122 randomly chosen 3-km long stretches of irrigation canals and watercourses in the central part of the River Po valley (c. 15 000 km(2); N Italy). The highest (>8/100 m) mean number of paths was recorded in the central part of the study area. According to the regression models, the overall number of coypu is predicted to range between 350 000 and 1 100 000, raising doubts about the effectiveness of current control measures.

AB Sediment rehydration is a useful technique to study various ecological aspects of resting egg banks of many aquatic invertebrates, but there is a paucity of such studies from the Asian region as compared with other regions. Hence, using a tropical temporary pool as a study system, and with successive, ex situ hydrations of sediments, we studied (1) the hatching phenology and dynamics of co-occurring Notostraca and Anostraca, and (2) the effects of cyclical hydroperiods on these dynamics. Ten species of different aquatic taxa emerged from the sediments. Among the large branchiopods, the primary consumer Streptocephalus dichotomus (Anostraca) was more numerous than the predatory Triops granarius (Notostraca). However, while differing in ecological roles, the two species exhibited similar phenology and hatching strategies, with nauplii emerging in similar proportions across hydration treatments, peaking at the first hydration (similar to 90%), and decreasing through the third. Hatching began on day 1 in all hydrations and peaked on days 2-3. Hatching duration decreased with successive hydrations, being the longest for the first hydration. These species are important to the food chain associated with temporary aquatic habitats, which are relatively understudied in the Indian context. Laboratory-based studies, in combination with field data can help understand the ecology of the associated community. We highlight the need for such studies that can prove important for conservation of such habitats, when their destruction is rampant and undocumented.

AB The partial consumption of prey refers to when a predator does not consume all the digestible biomass of an animal it has killed. The frequency of partial consumption of prey by the polyphagous predator Macrolophus pygmaeus (Hemiptera: Miridae) was recorded for different species of prey and prey population structures, in single and mixed prey species patches. All the instars of the aphid, Aphis gossypii, were provided as prey alone or together with Myzus persicae or Macrosiphum euphorbiae. Numbers killed were determined when equal (10 nymphs of each instar, 40 in total) or unequal numbers (higher numbers of young nymphs but again 40 in total) of nymphs were placed on an eggplant leaf in a plastic Petri dish. In each dish a single 5th instar nymph of the predator was introduced and the numbers killed and numbers of partially consumed aphids were recorded after 24h, at 25 +/- 1 degrees C. The numbers of A. gossypii killed were higher than those of the other species of prey used. The frequency of partially consumed prey was highest when A. gossypii was offered alone in equal numbers of each instar, followed by when A. gossypii was provided together with M. persicae in unequal numbers of instars (23.6% and 11.2%, of the total mortality, respectively). Killed but not consumed prey was also recorded, at frequencies that reached 10.7% of the total mortality when A. gossypii was provided alone in equal numbers of each instar. For M. persicae and M. euphorbiae, these percentages were significantly lower. The higher frequency of this behaviour when A. gossypii was the prey may be related to its lower nutritional quality for the predator. The effect of prey instar was not significant. These results indicate that in determining the numbers killed by a predator, partially consumed prey may make up a significant part of the total kill and thus should be taken into consideration.

AB We tested the effects of marine reserve status on the reproductive biology and recruitment rates of two commonly exploited (Helcion concolor, Scutellastra longicosta) and two rarely exploited (Cellana capensis, Scutellastra granularis) limpet species using two reserve and two non-reserve sites on the south coast of South Africa. Because densities of commonly exploited species are lower outside reserves, we hypothesised that limpets outside reserves will: (i) mature earlier; and (ii) show higher individual reproductive output. Rarely exploited species should show no such effects. For recruitment, we hypothesised that if recruits are attracted to adults or survive better where there are more adults, then commonly exploited (but not rarely exploited) species should show higher recruitment inside reserves. Analyses of gonadosomatic indices produced significant Month x Reserve interactions for all species (ANCOVA, p < 0.05), indicating inconsistent reserve effects even for exploited species, although months with significant differences occurred more often in the commonly exploited species, giving weak support to the hypothesis regarding reproductive output. Reserve status had no significant effect on sex ratios or size at sexual maturity for either sex of any species. Accordingly, reserves had only a minor influence on reproduction in these species, which might reflect an indirect effect of poor policing. The timing of major recruitment events differed among species, with two broad patterns: recruitment was sporadic for C. capensis and S. longicosta and protracted for H. concolor and S. granularis. Recruit densities showed strong site effects. Highest recruitment occurred at the exploited site, Xhora, with no reserve effects, except in a single month for C. capensis, indicating that recruitment is independent of whether the site is protected or not. Therefore, reserves do not enhance recruitment directly, but because these populations appear to be open on scales of tens of kilometres, generally higher densities of limpets within reserves could enhance overall recruitment, because of greater gamete output by the population. Accordingly, reserves might have an indirect 'spillover' effect on recruitment, if not a direct one.

AB Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) undergo the zoeal stage of development in open-ocean waters, where they experience stable salinity levels, low turbidity and reduced predation. The St Lucia estuarine system has undergone many geomorphological changes, both natural and anthropogenic, and the estuary mouth has been closed since the early 2000s. Despite recent attempts to improve marine connectivity, it remains limited, occurring primarily on the flood tide through channels connected to the adjacent Mfolozi River. Larval export from the St Lucia Estuary is therefore almost non-existent. A laboratory study was undertaken to examine the silt and salinity tolerance of Uca annulipes first stage zoeae, to investigate whether survival in the closed-estuary conditions would be possible. Salinity tolerance was narrow, with zoeae displaying 100% mortality at salinities <20 and >35 after five days. Zoeae were widely tolerant to silt loading and did not display a significant decrease in survival over a range of 0-1 000 NTU. A limited salinity tolerance is in accordance with the life-history strategy of fiddler crabs, and a high tolerance to turbid waters can be advantageous to small-bodied merozooplankton. Given the stenohaline nature of the zoeae, marine connectivity is therefore essential for the persistence of U. annulipes in this estuarine habitat.

AB Introduced invasive pests are perhaps the most important and persistent catalyst for changes in forest composition. Infestation and outbreak of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; HWA) along the eastern coast of the USA, has led to widespread loss of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), and a shift in tree species composition toward hardwood stands.
   Developing an understanding of the geographic distribution of individual species can inform conservation practices that seek to maintain functional capabilities of ecosystems. Modeling is necessary for understanding changes in forest composition, and subsequent changes in biodiversity, and one that can be implemented at the species level. By integrating the use of remote sensing, modeling, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) coupled with expert knowledge in forest ecology and disturbance, we can advance the methodologies currently available in the literature on predictive modeling.
   This paper describes an approach to modeling the spatial distribution of the less common but foundational tree species eastern hemlock throughout the state of Maine (similar to 84,000 km(2)) at a high resolution. There are currently no published accuracy assessments on predictive models for high resolution continuous distribution of eastern hemlock relative basal area that span the geographic extent covered by our model, which is at the northern limit of the species' range. A two stage mapping approach was used where presence/absence was predicted with an overall accuracy of 85% and the continuous distribution (percent basal area) was predicted with an accuracy of 84%. Overall, these findings are quite good despite high variability in the training dataset and the general minor component that eastern hemlock represents in the primary forest types in Maine.
   Eastern hemlock occurs along the southern half of the state stretching the east-west span with little to no occurrence in the northern regions. Several environmental and site characteristics, particularly average yearly maximum and minimum temperatures, were found to be positively correlated with hemlock occurrence. Eastern hemlock dominated stands appeared predominantly in the southwest corner of the state where HWA monitoring efforts can be focused. Given the importance of climate variables in predicting eastern hemlock, forecasts of future range shifts should be possible using data generated from climate scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   PROTECTION; DOMATIA; MYRMECOPHYTES
AB Myrmecophyte plants house ants within domatia in exchange for protection against herbivores. Ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms exhibit two general patterns due to competition between ants for plant occupancy: (i) domatia nest sites are a limiting resource and (ii) each individual plant hosts one ant species at a time. However, individual camelthorn trees (Vachellia erioloba) typically host two to four ant species simultaneously, often coexisting in adjacent domatia on the same branch. Such fine-grain spatial coexistence brings into question the conventional wisdom on ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms. Camelthorn ants appear not to be nest-site limited, despite low abundance of suitable domatia, and have random distributions of nest sites within and across trees. These patterns suggest a lack of competition between ants for domatia and contrast strongly with other ant-myrmecophyte systems. Comparison of this unusual case with others suggests that spatial scale is crucial to coexistence or competitive exclusion involving multiple ant species. Furthermore, coexistence may be facilitated when co-occurring ant species diverge strongly on at least one niche axis. Our conclusions provide recommendations for future ant-myrmecophyte research, particularly in utilizing multispecies systems to further our understanding of mutualism biology.

AB Chemically-mediated orientation is essential for many animals that must locate sites containing resources such as mates or food. One way to find these areas is by using publically-available information from other individuals. We tested a freshwater snail, Physa gyrina, for chemoreception of conspecific cues and predicted they could discriminate between cues based on information regarding hunger levels. We placed 'tracker' snails into a 2-arm arena where they could either follow or avoid an area previously used by a 'marker' snail. The hunger levels of both trackers and markers was manipulated, being either starved or fed. Starved and fed trackers did not differ in their following response when markers were hungry, but starved trackers were significantly more likely to follow fed markers, compared to fed trackers that tended to avoid areas used by fed markers. This outcome suggests that P. gyrina uses conspecific chemical cues to find food and potentially in some situations to avoid intra-specific food competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study investigated the history, occurrence, geographical distribution and invasiveness of the exotic Acacia species in Zimbabwe using herbarium and literature records. At least 17 Acacia species originating from Australia were introduced to Zimbabwe, with nine species (52.9% of total) documented as casuals, naturalized or invasive. Acacia mearnsii and A. melanoxylon were recognized as invasive, A. dealbata, A. decurrens, A. elata and A. podalyriifolia as naturalized, and A. baileyana, A. longifolia and A. salicina as casuals. All nine exotic Acacia species were introduced as ornamentals, A. dealbata, A. decurrens and A. mearnsii were also introduced for tanbark, and A. longofolia, A. mearnsii and A. melanoxylon were also introduced for timber. The majority (88.9%) of exotic Acacia species were introduced in the eastern part of Zimbabwe, a region characterized by tropical to semi-temperate climate, which is similar to the areas of origin of Acacia species.

AB Acid mine waters (pH 3-5) at the closed Wangaloa coal mine have resulted from surface runoff and groundwater seepage in contact with pyrite-bearing waste rock piles. The low nutrient content, physical factors, and elevated boron levels, all combined with the low pH (down to pH 2) of most waste rocks have limited early planned revegetation and natural plant colonisation. A renewed programme of site rehabilitation, started in 2000, focussed on establishment of near-complete ground cover and functioning ecosystems. Small patches (tens of m(2)) of low-pH, boron-rich, unvegetated substrates persist after more than 10 years of rehabilitation and introduction of a wide variety of species, but natural colonisation is slowly advancing on these remnants. The rehabilitation has coincided with and contributed to a rise in runoff water pH from a parts per thousand 4.5 to a parts per thousand 5.6. This decrease in severity of acid mine drainage (AMD) has apparently become sustainable without further intervention. Near-complete vegetative cover occurred by a combination of a major planting programme and natural colonisation from nearby islands of established native species. Both processes were accompanied by development of functioning ecosystems, and supported by increasing invertebrate diversity and abundance, which are ensuring the persistence of the ameliorative effects on AMD at the site. Vegetation established via natural processes can function ecologically at a higher level than comparable planted vegetation but may not lead to the desired plant cover on some substrates.

During the mass flowering episode of Philippine teak, 4,479 trees were counted based on plotless-ocular canopy density count. Natural population was pictured along coastal forests, littoral cliffs and inland exposed limestone ridges (5-200 m above sea level) in the municipality of Lobo (2,963) and adjoining Batangas City (946), Taysan (98) and San Juan (464). At least 62% (170 of 275 individuals) in the sampled habitats belonged to large diameter at breast height (DBH) class-size that exhibits GF. Flowering in at least >30 cm DBH class was observed during the arrival of the northeast monsoon in June until mid-July while masting started in August and drupes matured in September. Vegetative phenology (major leaf flushing) was observed from September to January until the population became leafless snags in summer.

AB The Cape gannet Morus capensis, a large fish-eating seabird, is endemic to southern Africa. To study the energetics of nestling growth, we used the doubly labeled water technique to measure field metabolic rate (FMR) of nestlings, from hatchings to large partly feathered chicks (n =17) at Malgas Island, Saldanha Bay, South Africa. At the same time, the growth rate of a large sample of chicks was measured (n = 338). These data, together with literature values on resting metabolic rate and body composition, were used to construct and partition the nestling energy budget. Nestling FMR (kJ d(-1)) increased with body mass according to FMR = 1.23m(0.923), r(2) = 0.944. Mass-specific FMR (FMRratio; kJ d(-1) g(-3/4)) was independent of chick age (r(2) = 0.20, P > 0.05); mean mass-specific FMR was 4.11 +/- 1.28, n = 17. Peak daily-metabolized energy (DME), which represents the maximum rate at which parents must supply their nestlings, occurred at age 71 d and was 2,141 kJ d(-1). Between the ages 51 and 92 d (43% of the fledging period), the DME of Cape gannet chicks was equal to or surpassed 90% of adult FMR at the nest. Energy demand during this period of peak DME represented 58% of the total metabolized energy, which was estimated at 150.1 MJ for an average chick during a 97-d period, from hatching to fledging. Sensitivity analysis of the energy budget indicated that the model was robust; the biggest source of error (+15%) was for the mass-FMR equation used in the model.

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate phytoecological and phytosociological characteristics of the vegetation distributed in Princes' Islands (Istanbul/Turkey). Field studies were carried out during 20022010 following the classical Braun-Blanquet method. The data obtained from the research area on characteristics of two associations belonging to maquis vegetation was analyzed. One of these associations was new and its detailed description, typification and syntaxonomy are mentioned. The associations identified were: Arbuto unedonis - Phillyretum latifoliae ass. nova and Phillyreo latifoliae-Pinetum brutiae. The physical and chemical characteristics of soil like saturation (%), pH, P2O, (kg dal, K2O (kg da(-1)), CaCO2(%), total salt (%) and organic matter (%) are presented as well. Relationship between vegetation, ecological characteristics and their protection against biotic pressures were discussed together with phytosociological and phytoecological features of the associations and was compared with similar other studies.

AB Invasive species pose a serious threat to the conservation of biodiversity. Forestry is the most important driver of the introduction and spread of invasive woody plant species after horticulture. Nearly 450 invasive tree species have been recorded worldwide, amounting to more than half the world's total invasive woody flora. Australian-native Acacia mearnsii De Wild. is one of world's top invasive alien tree species related to forestry. The negative impacts of alien species spilling over into conservation areas because of forestry are increasingly being recognized, and we examined the context and timing of this Australian species' arrival in Rwanda. The role of A. mearnsii in Rwanda's colonial and postcolonial forestry and the species' threat to biodiversity conservation are also investigated. The results suggest that A. mearnsii (a) was introduced into Rwanda between 1903 and 1918, with the earliest formal record dating back to 1941; (b) was a major forestry tree species until the late 1960s when its use in forestry declined significantly; and (c) demonstrates a comparatively higher occurrence and potential of regeneration within the understory of Eucalyptus plantations within the Congo-Nile ridge buttress; Bufundu and Bushiru; and Budaha, Ndiza, and Buberuka agro-bioclimatic zones. More recently, A. mearnsii has invaded national parks and forest reserves above 1,600 m of altitude. The most significant case was recorded at Nyung we National Park (NNP), East Africa's largest montane rainforest. A study of biomass and spatial patterns of this species in specific ecosystems, such as NNP, is strongly recommended in order to uphold effective conservation practices.

AB Previous investigations reported that some traits of parental relationships, including pair-bond duration or mate behavioural compatibility, influence subsequent offspring fitness by acting on their behaviour and growth and thus their early survival. We hypothesized that the development of a pair bond between sexual partners would have a prenatal influence. This study investigated the impact of two pairing managements on the egg characteristics and development of offspring of Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). Thirty males and 30 females were paired either continuously (C; mates together all the time) or non-continuously (NC; pairs met only three times a week for 5 min). Separation-reunion tests evaluated parental pair bond. Egg yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels were evaluated, and the somatic and behavioural development of C and NC chicks was assessed. Our results revealed that members of C pairs were attached to their mates and, although no significant differences in androgen levels could be evidenced between egg sets, a higher proportion of C pairs' eggs were fertilized and their chicks appeared less emotive and more social. Our results revealed that the parental relationship can modulate the behavioural development of their offspring, probably via non-genetic effects, and this could play a major role in the emergence of inter-individual variability.

AB Patellogastropods are poorly recorded in sedimentary rocks. This hinders our understanding of their evolutionary and migratory history in the geologic past. The Middle Pleistocene Ichijiku Formation in the Boso Peninsula, central Japan, consists of sand wave deposits formed at 50 to 130 m water depth by unidirectional currents on a sea floor and contains an unusually well preserved and highly diverse patellogastropod assemblage. A total of 12 patellogastropod taxa have been collected: seven species of Cellana (Nacellidae), four species referred to as living Lotiidae, and one undetermined species of the family Lottiidae. Of the seven species of Cellana, five are described as new (Cellana yamamotoi sp. nov., C. bosoensis sp. nov., C. ignieulus sp. nov., C. kobayashii sp. nov., and C. kamatakiensis sp. nov.), one is related to the modern C. toreuma (Reeve), and one poorly preserved taxon is unnamed but probably extinct. The assemblage represents a window into a Middle Pleistocene patellogastropod community in central Japan, which differs markedly from the modern fauna in the dominance of the genus Cellana. Selective extinction is noted for the genus Cellana. The habitat loss during the glacial lowstands of sea level is a plausible explanation for this selective extinction.

AB Although information about the hydrologic and ecological features of lowland evergreen forests in central Cambodia has been collected since the beginning of the 21st century, measurements of the transpiration process remain very limited. This paper describes the differences detected in transpiration (q) and crown-level stomatal conductance (G(S)) between Calophyllum inophyllum (which undergoes successive leaf exchange) and Drypetes sp. (which performs irregular leaf exchange) (hereafter referred to as Calophyllum and Drypetes, respectively), and the analysis of these differences in consideration of their contrasting leaf phenologies. We evaluated q using sap flow measurements and obtained daily G(S) values. Calophyllum and Drypetes had high and low periods between which q and G(S) differed significantly. Within high/low periods, smaller scatter in the plot of G(S) versus vapour pressure deficit (D) was found in Calophyllum compared to Drypetes. For a given value of D, q in high periods was 1.3 and 1.9 times larger than in low periods for Calophyllum and Drypetes, respectively. The smaller scatter for Calophyllum was the result of relatively constant physiological activity that was maintained by successive leaf fall. For both species, high periods were recorded after remarkable leaf-fall events; thus, our current data implied that leaf phenology is one of the most important factors affecting transpiration.

   modeling; population monitoring; trapping grids
AB The Key Largo cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola) was federally listed as Endangered in 1984 due to habitat loss and subsequent population decline, but because of infrequent monitoring, the extent of decline and long-term population trends are unknown. We modeled population abundance under a variety of trapping scenarios to develop a monitoring protocol that would provide accurate population estimates and could be conducted more frequently under current personnel and budget constraints. We captured cotton mice on 33 trapping grids in Key Largo, Florida, USA, during 3 trapping sessions (1 Mar-11 May, 4 Jul-7 Sep, and 29 Oct-31 Dec) in 2007. We compared demographic parameter estimates from subsets of trapping grids with estimates from all grids to identify a subset of grids that would produce population estimates within 10% and remain within the 95% confidence intervals of estimates using all grids when both methods were extrapolated to total available habitat. There were insufficient captures in session 1 to produce a reliable population estimate. We found that 13 and 12 trapping grids, respectively, produced abundance estimates meeting our criteria in sessions 2 and 3. We conclude that the subset of 12 grids trapped during November and December will allow a 64% reduction in number of trapping grids necessary to provide a reliable population estimate. Employed annually, our recommended trapping protocol provides state and federal agencies an efficient method for monitoring trends in the Key Largo cotton mouse population.

AB Goals: To analyze the relative importance for litter decomposition rates of the type of roadslope, topsoil addition and the chemical composition of litter from grasses and legumes commonly used in roadslope restoration, and assess the implications for roadslope restoration and management.
   Methods: Decomposition rates of four grasses and four legumes (leaves and stems) were compared after 3, 6 and 12 months of roadslope revegetation on embankments and roadcuts. To separate the effect of topsoil from other characteristics of each type of roadslope, a greenhouse litter decomposition experiment was also conducted for periods of 2,4 and 6 months in pots with and without topsoil addition.
   Results: At the end of both experiments, the percentage of organic matter remaining (OMR) from legumes was lower than that of grasses (0.33% and 0.47% in the field experiment, 0.42% and 0.53% in the greenhouse), and decreased exponentially with time in all cases during the first year. These differences in decomposition rates between legumes and grasses were related to the chemical composition of their litter. Legume litter decomposes more quickly than grass litter due to its higher N and lignin content and its lower hemicellulose content.
   The type of roadslope did not influence the OMR in the field experiment. In the greenhouse experiment, OMR was slightly lower in samples without than those with topsoil, but only at the end of the experimental period, when greater humidity in the latter pots probably reduced the enzymatic activity of the microbial community.
   Conclusions: We conclude that litter chemical composition is more important for litter decomposition than the type of roadslope or topsoil addition, possibly due to the poor soils in the study area. In the light of these results, we recommend a higher percentage of legumes than grasses in restoration projects with a view to reducing litter accumulation on roadslopes and lowering fire management expenditure.

AB Selective logging is a widely extended forestry practice that affects tree populations by changing their spatial structure. As most tropical timber tree species are animal-pollinated, selective logging increase the average distance between conspecific trees and hereby affect the guild of pollinators and gene flow between the standing trees. In order to study the effects of logging on the population genetics of tropical timber tree species, we assessed selfing rates, genetic diversity, effective number of pollen donors and effective distances of pollination in progenies collected in a recently logged plot and a un-logged-control plot of Guibourtia chodatiana (Hassl.). We found outcrossing rates close to one, even in the logged plot where the density had been reduced to 55%. Mean expected heterozygosity was almost identical in the logged and un-logged plots (H-e Control = 0.38 +/- 0.20 SD; H-e Logged = 0.41 +/- 0.21 SD) and genetic differentiation between plots was very low (F-st = 0.03). The logged population had a slightly higher effective number of pollen donors compared to the control (N-ep Logged = 12.5; N-ep Control = 10, respectively). However, the fruit set was almost twice in the control than in the logged plot. This finding suggests that there could be a pollinator limitation leading to reduction of fertilized ovules (i.e. fruits) in the logged plot. However, the larger distances of pollination in the logged than in the control plot (under the assumption of normal and negative exponential distributions) suggest that pollinators could bridge the inter-tree distances, despite the occurrence of logging.

AB Gouldian Erythrura gouldiae and Long-tailed Finches Poephila acuticauda are morphologically and ecologically similar sympatric species, for which social dominance relationships are likely to determine access to critical limiting resources. Building on previous research showing that Long-tailed Finches dominate competition for nest-sites, I staged dyadic contests for food between the two species in captivity in order to test social dominance dynamics under controlled conditions. Long-tailed Finches were likely to dominate interactions with Gouldian Finches and expressed higher levels of aggression while competing for access to food. These results suggest a stable dominance relationship between the two species which could be affecting Gouldian Finches' access to food resources in the wild, potentially constraining their ability to recover from recent population declines.

AB We evaluated the factors that affect the food resource use by Plagioscion ternetzi using three approaches: spatial, seasonal, and ontogenetic changes. Fish were sampled between March 2000 and February 2001 and March 2003 and February 2004 in the Sinha Mariana and Chacorore lagoons, wetlands of the Pantanal Matogrossense. Fish was the predominant food in the diet, but shrimps and insects have been also consumed. The diet of P. ternetzi was significantly different between lagoons, but no difference was detected between dry and flood periods. In Sinha Mariana lagoon, the diet mainly consisted of Psectrogaster curviventris, in both periods. In the flood period in Chacorore lagoon, fish was the dominant food (especially Astyanax spp., Leporinus spp. and Schizodon borellii), and in dry, shrimp and Eigenmannia spp. The Spearman coefficient indicated no correlation between the abundance of caught fish species and their abundances in the diet of P. ternetzi in Sinha Mariana lagoon, and a strong negative correlation at Chacorore lagoon, although some very consumed preys were numerically abundant in the environment. Despite the intake of insect and shrimp, P. ternetzi was piscivorous since immature stages. A correlation between each item and the size classes of P. ternetzi was tested by means of Pearson correlation that showed that the changes in the use of resources over ontogenetic development have been represented by increased intake of P. curviventris in Mariana lagoon, and S. borellii at Chacorore lagoon, accompanying the increase in the size of the predator. In this way, the results suggest that several factors can be involved in the use of food resources by P. ternezi, among them the abundance, the size and morphological characteristics of the prey.

AB Annual rural incomes in Southern Africa show large rainfall-induced fluctuations. Variable rainfall has serious implications for agro-pastoral activities (crop cultivation and livestock keeping), whereas wildlife and tourism are less affected. The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of wildlife income in reducing rainfall-induced fluctuations in households' annual incomes. We analyse costs and benefits from agro-pastoral systems in southeastern Zimbabwe by means of a two-tier longitudinal survey and wildlife benefits through analysis of wildlife revenues. We use the portfolio theory framework to investigate whether wildlife conservation has the potential for farmers to reduce risk associated with agricultural production. Results show that even though wildlife income is small, it tends to be less volatile than income from the agro-pastoral system. Furthermore, the addition of wildlife as an asset to the rural farmers' portfolio of assets showed that wildlife can be used as a hedge asset to offset risk from agricultural production without compromising on return. The potential of diversification using wildlife is, however, limited since agriculture and wildlife assets are positively correlated. We conclude that revenues from wildlife have some potential to reduce annual household income fluctuations, but only to a limited extent. We argue that if wildlife is organised on a more commercial basis, a more substantial role can be played by wildlife income in reducing variations in rural households' incomes.

AB Although the introduction of non-native species can have severe ecological and economic consequences, there is increasing awareness that introduced plants can also provide valuable ecosystem services. Here, we use tree-ring data from 30 sites in the southeastern US to demonstrate that non-native Lespedeza bicolor has long-term, positive effects on the growth of mature Pinus palustris trees. Trees growing near cultivated plots planted with nitrogen-fixing L. bicolor have experienced on average 56 % greater annual growth than trees growing near plots planted with non-nitrogen-fixing Secale cereale. Moreover, this fertilization effect has persisted for 25 years, since the local introduction of L. bicolor. This positive effect of L. bicolor provides evidence that non-native species may alter the growth of overstory trees that play important ecological and economic roles in southeastern forests, and suggests that subsidies from L. bicolor may influence carbon sequestration and change the nature of community dynamics at habitat edges. More generally, our results illustrate that non-native nitrogen-fixing understory plants may have strong, unappreciated effects on canopy tree growth, that the effects of non-native plants may have a distinct spatial extent, and that the net effect of non-native plants depends upon the interplay of ecological costs and benefits that may not be intuitive.

AB In natural forest ecosystems and plantations, most trees live in mutualistic association with mycorrhizal fungi. Studies of this association in South America are still scarce, especially when referring to the causes of temporal dynamics of this symbiotic community, despite its importance in countries with a thriving forestry industry like Chile. This study evaluates the dynamics of the ectomycorrhizal community of Pinus mdiata stands of 3, 10 and 20 years of age, identifying and quantifying the most common fungal colonizers of fine roots in each age class. The results confirm that the mycobiont community changes with host tree age but that age classes differ in dominance patterns rather than in species richness, with the three- and ten-year-old tree cohorts forming a group separate from the 20-year-old trees. A total of eleven ectomycorrhizal root morphotypes could be distinguished. Four of them which were identified as Hebeloma crustuliniforme, Inocybe sp., Russula sardonic and Pinirhiza spinulosa, were the most abundant (77, 29, 78 and 8 % respectively) and were found in more than one root sample whereas the remaining morphotypes accounted for less than 100 (< 7 %) root tips and showed a patchy distribution. Inocybe sp. was only found on root tips of three-year-old trees, characterizing as an early-stage mycobiont. H. crustuliniforme appeared as a multi-stage colonizer in all three age classes but was clearly dominant on roots of three- and ten-year-old trees, whereas R. sardonia was mainly found on roots of 20-year-old trees, classifying as a late-stage species together with the unidentified morphotype Pinirhiza spinulosa which is reported for the first time from Chile. Our results suggest that the observed changes in the ectomycorrhizal community are not induced by the site per se, but are rather an effect of the interaction between the trees and their environment.

DT Article
DE Larval dispersal; Spatial kernels; Connectivity
ID SETTLEMENT; RECRUITMENT
AB Models of larval dispersal in which ocean currents are Gaussian-distributed provide analytical solutions for the dispersal kernel that are usually assumed to be Gaussian-distributed as well. However, such Gaussian solutions are only valid for a single value of the duration of the larval period. In reality, larvae have a settlement competency period that can range from minutes to > 1 yr. Dispersal kernels computed for larvae having a competency period of finite length become non-Gaussian, because later settlers contribute proportionately more to both tails of the kernels than early settlers. In species where the variability in larval duration is large, or mean flows are large compared to the variability, the dispersal kernels approach uniform rather than Gaussian distributions.

AB Testudinalia testudinalis, the only species of intertidal limpet in the northwest Atlantic, feeds on the encrusting coralline alga Clathromorphum circumscriptum. We explored the behavior and habitat preference of this limpet in the intertidal zone of southern Maine and in laboratory experiments. We found T. testudinalis to be almost exclusively nocturnal, moving approximately 30-fold more during the night. This limpet did not home or display a consistent preference for any substrate as a resting site or preferred non-feeding habitat. However, they did show a significant preference for horizontal surfaces during feeding at night and vertical surfaces during the day. This behavior was observed at three intertidal sites along the Maine coast and in laboratory experiments, indicating a preference for a vertical resting site where heat stress, desiccation or predation may be less likely.

AB The trophic structure and biomass of macrobenthos on both wave-sheltered, rocky intertidal shores and semi-exposed ones at seven localities in the Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area were compared. In the Cochlear zone and entire intertidal (Cochlear- and Balanoid zones combined) biomass values of invertebrates and filter-feeders were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at semi-exposed shores, while grazer biomass was greater at sheltered sites: a negative relationship (P < 0.01) and a moderate to weak correlation (r > 0.42) was also recorded between filter-feeder biomass and grazer biomass. This negative relationship reflected changes in standing biomass of the two dominant filter-feeders (Octomeris angulosa and Perna perna) against that of the dominant grazer (Scutellastra cochlear). On sheltered shores the biomass of trophic groups varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the intertidal gradient studied, with values of grazers and algae decreasing with increased aerial exposure. Similar, but less substantial (P > 0.05) variations were recorded at semi-exposed sites, where the median shell length of the brown mussel P perna decreased upshore (P < 0.05). Multivariate analyses of square-root transformed biomass values separated most of the sheltered Cochlear zone stations from semi-exposed ones. This study supported the concept that the structure of low-shore communities is determined largely by differences in wave action.

AB The bacterial communities associated with the cockle (Cerastoderma edule) were investigated at the individual level through a 10-month monitoring programme. Temporal changes and those changes associated with a common parasite of the cockle, Bucephalus minimus, were investigated by monthly sampling of individuals, selected based on their shell length (cohort monitoring). Cockle bacterial community abundance (CBCA) and diversity (CBCD) were estimated by epifluorescence microscopy counts and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, respectively. CBCA showed a temporal pattern peaking at 30 x 10(6) cells per gram of cockle flesh and intervalval liquid in October and a significant 1.8-fold increase linked with B. minimus occurrence. CBCD was characterized by 112 +/- 26 intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) per individual and showed a relative homology between individuals (52 +/- 6%, Jaccard similarity) in spite of more than 30% of rare ITS. Consistent with an undisturbed evolution of the condition index of the studied cohort individuals as an estimate of their physiological state, neither temporal nor parasite-induced change in CBCA has been related to marked changes in CBCD.

AB The tropical montane conifer tree Widdringtonia whytei is found in small fragments on Mulanje Mountain in Malawi. A study was conducted with the objectives of determining the effect of population size, tree stem diameter and crown position on the proportion of viable seeds per cone produced by W. whytei at three sites (Sombani, Chambe and Lichenya) on Mulanje Mountain. Three population sizes, namely small (fragments with <= 10 cone-bearing trees), medium (fragments with 11-20 cone-bearing trees) and large (fragments with >20 cone-bearing trees) and isolated trees were sampled at each study site. In each fragment, four cone-bearing trees were randomly located, 20 mature cones were collected from each tree and the viability of seeds was tested. Only 23% of the seeds per cone were viable but seed viability per cone was highly variable among fragments. Large fragment populations produced the highest proportion of viable seeds per cone (30%), followed by similar proportions in small fragments (28.3%) and isolated trees (26.1%), with the lowest proportions in medium-sized fragments (18.7%), indicating a non-linear relationship between viable seed output per cone and population size. Tree stem diameter and crown position had no effect on the proportion of viable seeds per cone. Further studies are needed to identify the factors that lead to the low viable seed output per cone, and how this influences whole-tree seed production in W. whytei.

AB The research was carried out on natural pastures of Buzagici village of Tekirdag province, Turkey in 2005. The objective of this study was to determine effects of watering points on canopy cover, botanical composition, and hay yields of pastures using transect method. Data were collected from 4 different sites of natural pasture, two of which had watering points (sites 1 and 2), and two that had no watering points (sites 3 and 4). In sites 1 and 2, which had watering points, the percentage of botanical composition and percentage of canopy cover by grasses were less than in sites 3 and 4, which did not have watering points. The percentage of grasses in total vegetation increased with increasing distance from watering points. The highest total hay yield was obtained from site 4 (615.90 kg ha(-1)); the lowest yield of total hay was obtained from site 2 (450.00 kg ha(-1)). The periphery of watering points is always overgrazed by animals since they often visit watering points to drink water; therefore, those areas are generally covered by other families which have low feeding value.

AB Increasing efforts to implement marine protected areas (MPAs) as a means of managing marine ecosystems have created a need for evaluating potential spatial management plans. Almost all marine populations are metapopulations, connected reproductively by the dispersal of pelagic larvae. Models of marine population dynamics must account for larval connectivity, but despite recent advances connectivity patterns are still poorly understood. To allow more informed decision making when complete information on dispersal is lacking, we have developed a method based on geographic information systems (GIS) for representing larval dispersal distributions based on bathymetry and typical flows in the coastal ocean. These distributions reflect (1) generally greater flow in directions along, rather than across, lines of constant bathymetry and (2) lesser flow in shallow near-shore waters. We demonstrate how to parameterize this two-dimensional method for depicting larval dispersal based on comparisons to local oceanographic data. We then compare the predictions of the two-dimensional method to those of a simpler one-dimensional alternative in a population model used to evaluate proposed MPAs along the coast of central California. The method produces reasonable larval dispersal patterns and appears to include the effects of bathymetry on population dynamics better than commonly used one-dimensional methods and without requiring the significantly greater investment of developing particle-tracking circulation models. An important advantage of a two-dimensional approach is more realistic portrayal of the dependence of population persistence on the cross-shelf dimension of available habitat.

AB The gumboot chiton Cryptochiton stelleri Middendorff, 1847, is the largest intertidal invertebrate herbivore in the northeast Pacific, but little is known about the fine-scale distribution of this species within its range. In this study, extensive intertidal surveys were used to determine the distribution of C. stelleri within six rocky intertidal sites on the southern coast of Oregon, USA, and found that gumboot chitons show a patchy and clumped distribution. At all six sites, individuals were found at highest densities within small coves, and small specimens (< 15 cm long) were found almost exclusively in sea urchin pits. Age-frequency histograms were created for populations of C. stelleri at all six sites and showed sporadic cohort success, likely as a result of sporadic recruitment. Successful cohorts were indicated by peaks in the age-frequency histograms and were compared between sites in order to determine whether or not successful cohorts occurred at the same time at all sites. There was low similarity between sites, and a negative correlation was found between distance between sites and percent similarity in age-frequency peaks. Combined with other factors, this suggests that larval settlement and cohort success of C. stelleri is driven by local factors, not such large-scale factors as upwelling or El Nino.

TI Revising estimates of the Shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) population size in

   habitat suitability modelling
SO OSTRICH
LA English
DT Article
AB The Shoebill Balaeniceps rex is a threatened bird of inaccessible papyrus swamps in central and eastern Africa, and is thus difficult to census. We conducted an aerial survey of Shoebills in the Bangweulu Swamps of north-eastern Zambia using a microlight aircraft in July 2006, and used strip transect methodology to estimate population size. We then applied maximum entropy modelling to satellite images to produce a quantitative map of the likelihood of habitat being suitable (occupied), based on the location of Shoebill sightings. Population size was then re-estimated based on the extent of potentially suitable habitat, which covered 37% of the swamp. Our most conservative mean population size estimate of 1 296 individuals is 550% higher than previous estimates. We suggest that previous estimates may have been underestimates. Our study provides the first estimate of the extent of potentially suitable habitat and an estimate of the population size of Shoebills for the entire swamp. Our analysis of potential habitat suitability can be used to guide future Shoebill surveys, and our methodology can be applied to other little known and inaccessible sites to improve estimates of population size continent-wide.

AB Although most antlion species do not construct pits, the vast majority of studies on antlions focused on pit-building species. We report here on a transplant experiment aiming to test for morphological and life history differences between two desert populations of a sit-and-pursue antlion species, Lopezus fedtschenkoi (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), originating from habitats, which mainly differ in plant cover and productivity. We raised the antlion larvae in environmental chambers simulating either hyper-arid or Mediterranean climate. We found significant differences in the morphology and life history of L. fedtschenkoi larvae between the two populations. For example, the larvae originating from the more productive habitat pupated faster and had a higher growth rate. In agreement with the temperature-size rule, antlions reached higher final mass in the colder Mediterranean climate and exhibited a higher growth rate, but there was no difference in their developmental time. Observed differences in morphology between populations as well as those triggered by climate growing conditions could be explained by differences in size allometry. We also provide a quantitative description of the allometric growth axis, based on 12 morphological traits. Comparing the responses of L. fedtschenkoi with those observed in a co-occurring pit-building antlion indicated that there were neither shape differences that are independent of size nor was there a difference in the plasticity level between the two species.

AB Livestock from communities bordered by dune mining, urban areas and commercial forestry in northern KwaZulu-Natal spend substantial time foraging in the coastal forest that the mining company is obliged to restore. A survey of livestock owners and an experimental study of impacts of cattle on restoration processes were conducted to develop better knowledge of the perceptions of livestock owners neighbouring the mine, and the impacts of their cattle on rehabilitating coastal dune forest. Shortages of grazing and livestock diseases were perceived to be the major constraints on livestock operations. Mitigation included grazing cattle in the rehabilitating forest and treating livestock diseases with available medicinal plant species. An exclosure experiment in one of the older stands undergoing restoration showed that cattle grazing reduced grass biomass and Acacia kosiensis seedling recruitment. A study of seeds collected from cattle dung showed that Psidium guajava, an important invasive alien woody species, was dispersed by cattle into the rehabilitating forest, but passage through cattle did not enhance germination of the invasive species. The study concluded that: (1) the proximity of livestock owners to large-scale commercial land uses influenced their perceptions and their resources, and (2) grazing and trampling by cattle in the rehabilitating dune forest may hinder the ecological restoration process.

ID TROPICAL DEFORESTATION
AB In the 'pristine' environment the spatial distribution of tree resources is normally influenced by site characteristics, including physical and environmental factors such as availability of soil nutrients, light and water, as well as other natural conditions. When applied in conjunction with the Point Centre-Quarter Method (PCQM), however, transect analysis in Mufurudzi resettlement scheme projects a tree resource distribution that is akin to both spatial and historical contingency and demonstrates that tree resource distribution has been influenced by both past and present anthropogenic forces. This paper demonstrates that the deviation of the tree spacing at any location along the surveyed transect from the perfect triangular/hexagonal lattice connoted by tree density values for the whole transect provides a useful mechanism for unravelling historical and spatial contingency in tree resource distribution. This approach presents an alternative way of unveiling the anthropogenic processes that are responsible for shaping tree resource distribution at the micro-level, thus providing information about the micro-level dynamics of tree resource distribution and use patterns which policy makers and resource planners could consider when making decisions about community-based forest and woodland resource conservation. The paper concludes that though tree resource distribution in resettlement areas is partly the result of current patterns of tree resource utilisation, and a function of both the physical and social distance between the location of these resources and the 'nuclei' where these resources are used, that is, the resettlement villages, it is also a product of past land use patterns.

   Self-pollination
AB Pterygodium vermiferum, a new orchid belonging to the subtribe Coryciinae, is described from the coastal region in the southwestern part of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. It is most similar to Pterygodium volucris (L.f.) Sw. and differs most obviously in the possession of several remarkable long twisted appendages arising from the rostellum and in having a cucullate rather than tubular galea. The flowers open very briefly before wilting and setting seed by autonomous self-pollination. The morphological autapomorphies that define the species are interpreted as adaptations for autonomous self-pollination in a clade that is ancestrally pollinated by oil-collecting Rediviva bees. The description of P. vermiferum requires that another pollination independent Pterygodium taxon (P. newdigateae Bolus var. cleistogamum Bolus) also be awarded species status. (C) 2008 SAAB.

AB Large herbivore populations can suffer important oscillations with considerable effects on ecosystem functions and services, yet our capacity to predict population fate is limited and conditional upon the availability of data. This study investigated the interannual variation in the growth rate of populations of Capra pyrenaica Schinz, 1838, and its extinction risk by comparing the dynamics of populations that were stable for more than two decades (Gredos and Tortosa-Beceite), populations that had increased recently (Tejeda-Almijara), and populations that were in decline (Cazorla-Segura) or extinct (the Pyrenees population; hereafter, bucardo). To estimate quasi-extinction threshold assessments (50% of population extinct in this study), which have implications for the conservation of the species, we used empirical data and the predictions derived from several theoretical models. The results indicate that when variance of log population growth rate reaches a specific threshold, the probability of quasi-extinction increased drastically. For C. pyrenaica, we recommend keeping population variance < 0.05, which will reduce the likelihood that the irruptive oscillations caused by environmental and demographic stochasticity will put the population at risk. Models to predict the dynamics of C. pyrenaica populations should incorporate temporal stochasticity because, in this study, it strongly increased the likelihood that a population declined.

AB Antlions of the sub-family Myrmeleontinae in the Sikasso region of southern Mali were studied for almost 6 consecutive years. In total, 51 species or morpho-species were recorded. The assemblage is dominated by the tribe Nemoleontini (33 species). Other tribes represented are Nesoleontini (7 species), Myrmeleontini (5 species), Myrmecaelurini (3 species) and Acanthaclisini (3 species). Most of the identified species are new for Mali and, indeed, for sub-Saharan Africa. Six species are very abundant, 17 abundant, 13 fairly abundant and 15 rare. The average sex ratio of the whole assemblage is about I male to 1 female. An uninterrupted succession of species, with conspicuous temporal segregation, occurs throughout the year with varying overlap of the flight periods. The number of species recorded by month is highly correlated with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity (r(2) = 0.99). Species richness peaks in October and February, and is lowest in August. The estimated duration of flight periods ranges from 1020 days to 365 days. The average flight period is 80 days.

AB We censused plants bearing ripe fruit along eight permanently marked transects to describe patterns of ripe fruit availability in a spatially interspersed patchwork of seasonally dry forests in the northern Florida Keys. Plants were sampled every four to six weeks between May 1998 and April 1999. We noted every tree, shrub, or vine with ripe fleshy fruits present and rated each stem for the proportion of fruit produced. This sampling scheme allowed us to describe periods of ripe fruit availability in the forest community, as well as for the fourteen most frequently encountered species. Ripe fruit availability peaked during the wet season (July-September), deciduous trees and evergreen shrubs produced most of the fruit in most months, and most of the species producing fruit were evergreen trees in all months.

AB The vegetation of flat-top mountains (mesas) was investigated in northwest Namibia. The main questions were: (1) Are there differences between vegetation types on mountain tops and what is the composition of mountain top vegetation? (2) Do rare species affect the floristic relationship between mountain tops? and (3) What are the likely factors determining the vegetation on mountain tops? Seven vegetation types were described, comprising a sparse to medium cover mix of mainly shrubs and grasses. Vegetation types differed remarkably between mountain tops, even within the proximity of a few kilometres. No single environmental driver can explain the vegetation on the investigated mountain tops. Biogeographic influences (distance to other mountain habitat, size of habitat per se, position within phytogeographic zones), as well as physical variables such as soil properties, elevation (height above surroundings), a westeast gradient of increasing rainfall, and possible rain shadows were considered of importance in determining the documented vegetation types. Accessibility to large herbivores, hence grazing impacts, are other factors possibly influencing the derived vegetation types. Multivariate analyses with and without weightings of rare plant species showed that rare species had a significant influence on the results.The following practical considerations emanate from this study: (1) Extrapolation of mountain top vegetation in the general area will be difficult and more individual mountains, particularly higher ones, will need to be investigated. (2) The data analyses stressed the importance of rare species in determining floristic relationships.Complete botanical surveys, rather than surveys of general descriptors as in many environmental assessments in Namibia should thus be undertaken for management purposes in this area. (3) High mountain tops in Damaraland are relatively species rich and are prone to harbour species at their limit of distribution. These are of particular conservation importance.

AB Long-term common garden experiments provide the unique opportunity to assess the individual life-long and regeneration response of different tree species to their shared environment. The survival, growth, and regeneration of three locally native, 22 regionally native, and 16 normative (exotic to North America) tree species were measured in a common garden experiment established in 1888 on the jack pine barrens of northern lower Michigan. None of the stems from the 32 hardwood species survived. The conifers Pinus resinosa (35%), Picea abies (24%), and Pinus strobus (7%) had the highest survival of original stems; several stems of Juniperus virginiana, Picea glauca, Pinus rigida, and Thuja occidentalis also survived. Regeneration was dominated by Pinus strobus, R resinosa, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris in the plantation and by R strobus, unplanted P. banksiana, P. sylvestris, and unplanted Quercus spp. in the old field next to the plantation. Regeneration from Prunus serotina, Populus alba, Robinia pseudoacacia, Fraxinus americana, Acer rubrum, and A. platanoides was present in the plantation and/or adjacent old field. The survival, relatively low productivity (site indices of 28-29 for Picea spp. and 44-45 for Pinus resinosa and R strobus), and regeneration of the species planted at this site indicate that P. resinosa is the best species for wood production while P. strobus would be best to provide long-term forest cover.
   The normative Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies performed as well as or better than species native to the jack pine barrens. Pinus sylvestris is successfully recruiting outside of the original plantation next to the native early successional species P. banksiana and R strobus. Within the plantation, Picea abies had high survival and regenerated as much as the native dominant Pinus strobus. The naturalization of nonnative Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in this plantation suggests that these species have the potential to become invasive in the jack pine barren ecosystem.

AB We analyzed the response of the copepod community in relation to the influx of large amounts of clay from a bauxite processing operation, and to flood-pulse variations in Lake Batata, a typical Amazonian floodplain lake. From 1990 to 1999, zooplankton density and other environmental data were collected trimonthly in a natural area and in an area of the lake covered by bauxite tailings. The seasonal cycles of the main species of the orders Calanoida and Cyclopoida were closely linked to variations in the water level. Suspended clay particles may influence the top-down and bottom-up mechanisms regulating the copepod populations in Lake Batata.

AB Notoacmea biradiata (Reeve, 1855) is an abundant intertidal limpet on the rocky shore of the Colombian Pacific coast. This paper reports a field factorial experiment on shell-size variation of N. biradiata as a response to two independent factors: intertidal gastropod density and shore height above sea level. Four rocky shores were selected on the Colombian Pacific coast, two in Gorgona Island and two in Utria Cove. The intertidal gastropods density was determined in each rocky shore using the transect-quadrant technique. Significant differences were observed in the gastropod densities between study sites: low density in the rocky shores of Utria Cove and high density in the rocky shores of Gorgona Island (P < 0.009). A factorial sampling was conducted to determine the effect of the density and height on the shore over shell-length, shell-height and shell-thickness. A two-way ANOVA and a least-squared regression was used to determine whether the shell-sizes differ between varying densities and shore heights. Intertidal gastropod density was found to be the dominant factor in determining basal shell length (ANOVA, P < 0.001) and shell height (ANOVA P < 0.05) changes. Thus, at low population densities the shells are larger and taller. The height on the shore did not influence shell-size of N. biradiata (ANOVA, P > 0.30).

AB The relative abundances of the silicoflagellate Dictyocha speculum Ehrenberg and the ebridian Ebria tripartita (Schumann) Lemmermann within the total siliceous microfossil flora were determined in four sediment cores from the northwestern Baltic Sea covering the last c. 8,000 years, and that of Ebria tripartita in five short sediment cores from the southern Baltic Sea covering the last c. 100-200 years and in surface sediment samples from the northern and central Baltic Sea representing the years 1993 and 1997. In the present study it is shown that D. speculum has a well defined acme (peak) zone confined to c. 5,500-4,500 C-14 years BP, and it is suggested that this may represent the most saline phase in the Holocene history of the Baltic Sea. Ebria tripartita, on the other hand, has no distinct acme zone in the cores, although a slight increase in its relative abundance occurs c. 2.000-1,500 C-14 years BP in the three cores covering this period. It is also shown that there is no coherent trend in the abundance of E. tripartita during the most recent centuries, but that the variations seem to be confined to periods when there were major changes in diatom assemblages. It is concluded that E. tripartita is useful neither as a biomarker nor as a palaeoenvironmental indicator in the Baltic Sea. It is argued that the diatom assemblages, the resuspension effect, year to year fluctuations in bloom and the patchiness of the blooms are the main factors controlling the relative abundance of E. tripartita skeletons in Baltic Sea sediments.

AB Chaetopterus pergamentaceus is an abundant and functionally important species within the soft sediment, subtidal benthic community of lower Chesapeake Bay. The present study elucidates spatial relationships in density, individual ash-free dry weight, total station ash-free dry weight and growth rates for juveniles and adults from 2 yrs of sampling (1994, 1995) at 12 stations in the lower Chesapeake Bay. A strong inverse relationship (r(2) = 0.69) was observed between growth rates and total density for juveniles when data from a low(1994) and high(1995) recruitment year were considered. Common parameters among stations characterized by high density/low growth were: (1) depth (maximum for region); (2) proximity to the center of a major circulation eddy; (3) proximity to a channel; (4) higher food concentration (indexed by chi-a in surface sediment layer); and (5) higher physical energy in the benthic boundary layer region. The study provides evidence that spatial variation in population processes, concordant with major environmental gradients, strongly influences population dynamics. The effects of these environmental parameters on the population dynamics of this polychaete cannot yet be clearly resolved because the parameters are confounded.

AB A detailed analysis of the flora of the newly proclaimed Rap River Reserve (600 ha) is given. The reserve is adjacent to the Fish River and some 5 km from the Fish River Mouth. It consists of a coastal plateau up to 100 m a.s.l. which is steeply dissected by the two rivers that partially form the boundary of thc reserve. The flora of the reserve was sampled over a peri od of three years and plants were collected in all the vegetation types of grassland, thicket and forest. 488 species were collected with a species to family ratio of 4:4. The majority of the taxa recorded represent the major phytochoria of the region. Nineteen species are endemic to the Eastern Caps, two are classed as vulnerable, five are rare, six are protected and a further seventeen are of uncertain status. The flora of the Kap River has closest affinities to that of the Alexandria Forest.

AB This study reports the effects of grazing by the territorial limpet Patella longicosta on the productivity of the encrusting alga Ralfsia verrucosa. Grazing significantly increased algal growth during the first month of the study (August). Simulated grazing by brushing also enhanced productivity. However, the productivity of grazed and ungrazed algae did not differ significantly during the ensuing three months. As the growth of ungrazed plants remained the same throughout the study, the elevated productivity of grazed plants during August was attributed to increased limpet activity. The variation in grazer-induced algal growth was possibly associated with increased feeding when the limpets embark on energetically costly periods of reproduction.

AB The role of microorganisms in the maintenance of ecosystem and biosphere function indicates that bacterial biodiversity should be protected as part of an integrated management plan for the Indian River Lagoon System. Bacterial biodiversity is poorly defined for all types of habitats due to the difficulty in culturing and identifying bacteria. Molecular genetic techniques indicate that a significant number (probably the majority) of bacterial species remain unidentified. A short overview of the current status of bacterial biodiversity and its application to potential management plans for the Indian River Lagoon is presented.

AB Invasive Acacia species can alter nutrient cycling processes in forest ecosystems, particularly affecting total litterfall production and litter decomposition patterns. This study examined the effects of exotic Acacia mangium Willd. on total litterfall production, nutrient concentrations in leaf litterfall fractions, leaf litter decomposition, and nutrient release in lowland heath (HF) and mixed dipterocarp forests (MDF) in Brunei Darussalam, Borneo. Above-ground litterfall traps were installed in HF and MDF with and without invasive Acacia present, representing four habitat types in total, and monthly collections were conducted for 12 months. Litter decomposition bags were deployed to determine the rates of decomposition and nutrient release. Habitats invaded by Acacia exhibited higher total litterfall production, increased leaf litter concentrations of nitrogen, potassium, and calcium, and increased addition of all nutrients measured in litter (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, especially in the Acacia-invaded mixed dipterocarp forest (AMDF) and nitrogen and potassium in Acacia-invaded heath forest (AHF)), reduced nitrogen and potassium use efficiencies in AHF, and reduced stand-level nitrogen and calcium use efficiencies in AMDF. Litter decomposition rates and nutrient release were lower in AMDF than in the three other habitats. The significantly higher total litterfall production coupled with higher nutrient addition in the two Acacia-invaded habitats is expected to progressively increase the abilities of these habitats to produce large quantities of nutrient-rich litter and will likely eventually lead to an enrichment of nutrients in the soil, thus facilitating further invasion by Acacia, particularly in the MDF.

AB High community diversity may either prevent or promote the establishment of exotic species. The biotic resistance hypothesis holds that species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion than species-poor communities due to mechanisms including greater interspecific competition. Conversely, the invasional meltdown hypothesis proposes that greater exotic diversity increases invasibility via facilitative interactions between exotic species. To evaluate the degree to which biotic resistance or invasional meltdown influences marine community structure during the assembly period, we studied the development of marine epibenthic "fouling" communities at two southern California harbors. With a focus on sessile epibenthic species, we found that fewer exotic species established as total and exotic richness increased during community assembly and that this effect remained after accounting for space availability. We also found that changes in exotic abundance decreased over time. Throughout the assembly period, gains in exotic abundance were greatest when space was abundant and richness was low. Altogether, we found greater support for biotic resistance than invasional meltdown, suggesting that both native and exotic species contribute to biotic resistance during early development of these communities. However, our results indicate that biotic resistance may not always reduce the eventual dominance of exotic species.

AB The growing human population in Africa is putting increasing pressure on habitats and wildlife outside of protected areas. The wildlife conservancy model in Namibia empowers rural communities to decide on the use of wildlife. Namibia started to implement the conservancy model in the 1990s and provides relevant experience from which other countries can learn. We reviewed the conservancy model in northwest Namibia to identify lessons for other countries. Our core work included case studies on six conservancies. We confirmed success factors for conservancies include: investment and revenues, strong governance and support from NGOs, as has been identified in previous studies. We conclude that a comprehensive wildlife monitoring programme is also a critical success factor. The wildlife monitoring method in conservancies in Namibia has been consistent since 2001, and the results show that populations have recovered and stabilised, although there are ongoing risks to wildlife and habitats in this fragile landscape.

AB In Namibia, leopards (Panthera pardus) are widely distributed, used commercially as trophy animals and are often persecuted for perceived or real predation on livestock and valuable game species outside protected areas. Therefore, leopard populations living in protected areas might be important source populations and for maintaining connectivity. Little data on their population sizes and densities are available from the northern part of the country, particularly from protected areas. Here, we estimated leopard densities using a spatial capture-recapture approach in northern Namibia: (i) the Khaudum National Park (KNP) in north-east Namibia with an annual average rainfall of 450 mm and (ii) the Lower Hoanib River (LHR) in north-west Namibia with an annual average rainfall of 25 mm. With an effort of 2430 and 2074 camera trap nights in the KNP and LHR, respectively, 11 adult female and six adult male leopards were identified in the KNP, whilst only one adult female leopard was detected once in the LHR. For the KNP, a maximum likelihood approach (using the package SECR) revealed a density estimate of 2.74 leopards/100 km(2), whereas a Bayesian approach (using the package SPACECAP) revealed a density estimate of 1.83 leopards/100 km(2). For the LHR, no density estimate could be determined and it is suggested that the leopard density in such an arid environment is low. These are the first leopard density estimates based on camera trap surveys provided for these protected areas and thus of importance for further monitoring programs to understand leopard population dynamics. We discuss our findings with current habitat changes and conservation measures in both study areas.

AB Aim In coastal marine systems, biogenic reef-building species have great importance for conservation as they provide habitat for a wide range of species, promoting biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services. Biogenic reef persistence and recovery from perturbations depend on recolonization by new recruits. Characterizing larval dispersal among distant reefs is key to understanding how connectivity shapes metapopulation structure and determines network coherence; all of which are of critical importance for effective conservation. Location Northeast Atlantic coast and western English Channel, France. Methods We used a biophysical transport model to simulate larval dispersal of the reef-building polychaete Sabellaria alveolata. We combined dispersal modelling and network analysis into a framework aiming to identify key reef areas and critical dispersal pathways, whose presence in the network is vital to its overall coherence. We evaluated changes in dispersal pathways constrained by different connectivity thresholds, i.e., minimum dispersal rate for the presence of a connection. We tested scenarios of sequential loss of reefs: randomly, by habitat quality (a score for reef status and occupancy in an area) or by betweenness centrality metric (BC; quantifying the proportion of shortest paths connecting all areas that are passing through any given area). Results We found that the network of S. alveolata reefs forms two main regional clusters, the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, which are connected only through weak sporadic dispersal events. Within each cluster, the network is characterized by relatively high connectivity among neighbouring areas with reefs, maintained even under higher connectivity thresholds. Simulating scenarios of sequential loss of reefs further identified high centrality reefs, those with highest BC values, key to network coherence. Main conclusions Effective conservation of this important reef habitat requires a network of protected areas designed to sustain a combination of locally important source reefs, and those that act as stepping stones connecting distant reefs.

AB Highly mobile organisms can transport nutrients and energy among distinct ecosystems, such as between oceanic foraging areas and terrestrial breeding sites. Seabirds are great nutrient carriers and potentially play a key role in the maintenance of trophic webs on islands. In this study, we assessed three dimensions of marine nutrient dissipation-horizontal, temporal and vertical-on the tropical Meio Island of Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil. For this, C-3 and C-4 plants, ants and spiders found in a 100 m long transect between colonies of masked (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula) were sampled during the rainy (the masked booby breeding period) and dry seasons (the red-footed booby breeding period). The marine contribution to the terrestrial trophic web was analysed using Bayesian mixing models from a carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data set. The main findings indicate that marine nutrients in the terrestrial trophic web dissipated horizontally as the distance from the colony increased, which was more marked during the rainy season. On the vertical axis, the relative contribution of marine nutrients in terrestrial consumers was strongly related to food habits but not necessarily to the trophic level, dissipating rather than increasing, due to variable omnivory and the use of terrestrial food sources. The breeding strategy of the masked booby (i.e. incubating eggs on the ground), in addition to a larger body size and larger colony, could produce a more concentrated pulse of nutrients in comparison to seabirds nesting sparsely on trees, contributing more efficiently to the enrichment of marine nutrients on land. The importance of seabirds for the maintenance of interconnected ecosystems has been demonstrated, and the role of marine-derived nutrients in the enrichment of nutrient-poor tropical islands.

AB The Atlantic Forest of the southern Brazilian highlands is a biocultural mosaic of Araucaria Forest and grasslands. Despite adverse impacts on biodiversity, extensive areas are being afforested with non-native pine (Pinus spp.), triggering forest succession on areas that were previously native grasslands. The long-term effects of afforestation with these non-native trees for biodiversity conservation are still unknown. Here, we assess this issue by comparing the fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in young (20 year) and old (70 year) pine plots with nearby native Araucaria Forest. Abundance and richness of butterflies were positively correlated with temperature and mean humidity only in the native forest. Abiotic conditions differed between vegetation types: there was more sunlight, and was warmer and drier in the pine afforestation plots than in the Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species composition was similar between young and old pine plots, but distinct from the native Araucaria Forest. Butterfly species abundances in native forests were more evenly distributed than in afforestation sites. In these pine sites, assemblages were dominated by small, grass-feeding satyrines, whereas old pine sites had more liana feeding biblidines, and the Araucaria Forest had more large-sized bamboo-feeding species. Our results indicate that even after 70 years of succession a non-native pine afforestation cannot support a butterfly assemblage as that found in the neighboring preserved forest. Moreover, threatened grassland specialist species have been locally extinct after only 20 years of pine afforestation. The evidence gathered here points against the use of silviculture with non-native trees in these biocultural mosaic landscapes.

AB In this paper, we present an open-source software library that can be used to numerically simulate the advection and diffusion of a chemical concentration or heat density in a viscous fluid where a moving, elastic boundary drives the fluid and acts as a source or sink. The fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction problem of an elastic boundary in a viscous fluid is solved using Peskin's immersed boundary method. The addition or removal of the concentration or heat density from the boundary is solved using an immersed boundary-like approach in which the concentration is spread from the immersed boundary to the fluid using a regularized delta function. The concentration or density over time is then described by the advection-diffusion equation and numerically solved. This functionality has been added to our software library, IB2d, which provides an easy-to-use immersed boundary method in two dimensions with full implementations in MATLAB and Python. We provide four examples that illustrate the usefulness of the method. A simple rubber band that resists stretching and absorbs and releases a chemical concentration is simulated as a first example. Complete convergence results are presented for this benchmark case. Three more biological examples are presented: (1) an oscillating row of cylinders, representative of an idealized appendage used for filter-feeding or sniffing, (2) an oscillating plate in a background flow is considered to study the case of heat dissipation in a vibrating leaf, and (3) a simplified model of a pulsing soft coral where carbon dioxide is taken up and oxygen is released as a byproduct from the moving tentacles. This method is applicable to a broad range of problems in the life sciences, including chemical sensing by antennae, heat dissipation in plants and other structures, the advection-diffusion of morphogens during development, filter-feeding by marine organisms, and the release of waste products from organisms in flows.

AB Background Keel flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, pentamerous flowers with three different petal types and reproductive organs enclosed by keel petals; generally there is also connation of floral parts such as stamens and keel petals. In this study, the evolution of keel flowers within the order Fabales is explored to investigate whether the establishment of this flower type within one of the species-rich families, the Fabaceae (Leguminosae), preceded and could have influenced the evolution of keel flowers in the Polygalaceae. We conducted molecular dating, and ancestral area and ancestral state analyses for a phylogeny constructed for 678 taxa using published matK, rbcL and trnL plastid gene regions. Results We reveal the temporal and spatial origins of keel flowers and traits associated with pollinators, specifically floral symmetry, the presence or absence of a pentamerous corolla and three distinct petal types, the presence or absence of enclosed reproductive organs, androecium types, inflorescence types, inflorescence size, flower size, plant height and habit. Ancestral area reconstructions show that at the time keel flowers appeared in the Polygaleae, subfamily Papilionoideae of the Fabaceae was already distributed almost globally; at least eight clades of the Papilionoideae had keel flowers with a functional morphology broadly similar to the morphology of the first evolving Polygaleae flowers. Conclusions The multiple origins of keel flowers within angiosperms likely represent convergence due to bee specialization, and therefore pollinator pressure. In the case of the Fabales, the first evolving keel flowers of Polygaleae have a functional morphology that corresponds with keel flowers of species of the Papilionoideae already present in the environment. These findings are consistent with the keel-flowered Polygaleae exploiting pollinators of keel-flowered Papilionoideae. The current study is the first to use ancestral reconstructions of traits associated with pollination to demonstrate that the multiple evolutionary origins of the keel flower pollinator syndrome in Fabales are consistent with, though do not prove, mimicry.

AB The removal of trees in rangelands can create gaps and lead to increased grass production that could suppress subsequent tree seedling establishment and growth. However, gaps can also enhance the growth of remaining trees. We conducted a field experiment at two savanna sites with different soil texture and woody species. We used 24 plots at each site to determine the effect of tree-removal intensities (0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 75% and 100%) on grass production, tree-seedling establishment and growth, and growth of the remaining large trees. Site I was on previously cultivated severely-eroded clay-dominated soils, encroached by a monospecific stand of Vachellia tortilis. Site 2 had never been cultivated, and was on sandy soils with several woody species. At Site 1, 75 and 100% tree removal significantly reduced standing grass biomass towards the end of the first growing season, with no differences towards the end of the second season. At Site 2, tree removal significantly increased standing grass biomass. There was no significant effect of tree removal on tree seedling establishment at Site 1, but at Site 2 tree removal had a significantly negative effect on overall tree seedling establishment. At both sites, there were no significant differences in tree seedling growth. Moderate (50%) to high (75%) removal of trees had a positive effect on the growth of remaining large trees at both study sites. We found that tree seedling establishment could be affected by the level of grass biomass following tree removal, but other factors including soil erosion are also important considerations. Reduced tree competition facilitates growth of remaining large trees. An implication of these findings is that, regardless of the substantial costs of woody plant control, the recovery of key ecosystem services such as an increased forage production may not be realised. However, we recognise that this may be system-specific.

We located the current biodiversity and future extinction hotspots in the region and identified areas in urgent need for conservation prioritization, by undertaking an overlap analysis with the established protected areas network in Greece. Most bee species occurring in the archipelago are expected to face severe range contractions and there is evidence of an underlying extinction debt in the study area. Our work could serve as the baseline for the integration of a rather neglected, yet extremely economically and ecologically important taxonomic group, the bees, in the systematic conservation planning in the archipelago. Pollinators' climate change impact assessments focus mainly on mainland regions. Thus, we are unaware how island species might fare in a rapidly changing world. This is even more pressing in the Mediterranean Basin, a global biodiversity hotspot. In Greece, a regional pollinator hotspot, climate change research is in its infancy and the insect Wallacean shortfall still remains unaddressed. In a species distribution modelling framework, we used the most comprehensive occurrence database for bees in Greece to locate the bee species richness hotspots in the Aegean, and investigated whether these might shift in the future due to climate change and assessed the Natura 2000 protected areas network effectiveness. Range contractions are anticipated for most taxa, becoming more prominent over time. Species richness hotspots are currently located in the NE Aegean and in highly disturbed sites. They will shift both altitudinally and latitudinally in the future. A small proportion of these hotspots are currently included in the Natura 2000 protected areas network and this proportion is projected to decrease in the coming decades. There is likely an extinction debt present in the Aegean bee communities that could result to pollination network collapse. There is a substantial conservation gap in Greece regarding bees and a critical re-assessment of the established Greek protected areas network is needed, focusing on areas identified as bee diversity hotspots over time.

AB The extreme environmental conditions of the diverse saline inland waters (soda lakes and pans, hypersaline lakes and ponds) of the Carpathian Basin are an advantage for picophytoplankton. The abundance of picophytoplankton in these waters can be up to several orders of magnitude higher than that in freshwater shallow lakes, but differences are also found within different saline water types: higher picophytoplankton abundances were observed in hypersaline lakes compared to humic soda lakes, and their highest numbers were detected in turbid soda lakes. Moreover, their contribution to phytoplankton biomass is higher than that in shallow freshwater lakes with similar trophic states. Based on long-term data, their ratio within the phytoplankton increased with turbidity in the case of turbid soda lakes, while, in hypersaline lakes, their proportion increased with salinity. Picocyanobacteria were only detected with high abundance (>10(6)-10(7) cells/mL) in turbid soda lakes, while picoeukaryotes occurred in high numbers in both turbid and hypersaline lakes. Despite the extreme conditions of the lakes, the diversity of picophytoplankton is remarkable, with the dominance of non-marine Synechococcus/Cyanobium, Choricystis, Chloroparva and uncultured trebouxiophycean green algae in the soda lakes, and marine Synechococcus and Picochlorum in the hypersaline lakes.

AB Vegetative and reproductive growth of subtropical and tropical forests plays an important role in regulating carbon cycle and maintaining food web dynamic balance. Here, we used litterfall and climatic data during 1998-2017 at four evergreen forest sites in southern China to analyze temporal variations of community phenology and their climate drivers. Results show that two southwest forests have unimodal patterns with leaf litterfall peaks during dry season, while two southeast forests have bimodal patterns with the first peaks during rainy season and the second peaks during rainy and dry seasons respectively. Peaks of flower litterfall for the four forests occurred during the transitional period between dry and rainy seasons, while peaks of fruit litterfall appeared either at the end of the rainy season at the two southern sites or in the dry season at the two northern sites. Leaf litterfall correlates significantly positively with preseason maximum temperature at the four sites, but significantly negatively with preseason precipitation at two southwest sites. By contrast, flower and fruit litterfall correlates significantly positively with preseason temperature and precipitation at only three and two sites. Moreover, leaf, flower, and fruit litterfall exhibits a 12-month cycle, which is consistent with the 12-month cycle of monthly temperature and precipitation. Flower and fruit litterfall displays also multiyear cycles between 18 and 48 months, however, it is inconsistent with the multiyear cycles of monthly temperature and precipitation. Our study highlights that temperature and precipitation are key factors affecting litterfall variations in different time scales in southern China. Abstract in Chinese is available with online material.

AB We intend to assess how macrophyte cover affects planktonic microbial communities by changing the physical and chemical environment, and how macrophyte-derived DOC affects the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy/chemoorganotrophy in a shallow lake. The structure and production of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the open water of a large shallow lake and in the littoral zone were compared at two sampling stations with different macrophyte cover. According to the obtained results, uncoupling between bacterioplankton and phytoplankton was observed due to the high content of organic carbon of emergent macrophyte origin. While phytoplankton were regulated by TSS, bacterioplankton (in both heterotrophic and photoheterotrophic forms) were determined by dissolved organic carbon. As a result of these processes, the littoral and pelagic zones in the lake are completely separated from each other. In open water the autotrophic processes dominated, but at the sampling stations inside the reed belt, the metabolic processes shifted in the direction of chemoorganotrophy. Our results suggest that increase of macrophyte cover in shallow water bodies will increase the significance of microbe-based carbon pathways and weakens the efficiency of carbon transport from primary producers to higher trophic levels through the planktonic food chain.

AB Pollinator sharing between close relatives can be costly and can promote pollination niche partitioning and floral divergence. This should be reflected by a higher species divergence in sympatry than in allopatry. We tested this hypothesis in two orchid congeners with overlapping distributions and flowering times. We characterized floral traits and pollination niches and quantified pollen limitation in 15 pure and mixed populations, and we measured phenotypic selection on floral traits and performed controlled crosses in one mixed site. Most floral traits differed between species, yet pollinator sharing was extensive. Only the timing of scent emission diverged more in mixed sites than in pure sites, and this was not mirrored by the timing of pollinator visitation. We did not detect divergent selection on floral traits. Seed production was pollen limited in most populations but not more severely in mixed sites than in pure sites. Interspecific crosses produced the same or a higher proportion of viable seeds than intraspecific crosses. The two orchid species attract the same pollinator species despite showing divergent floral traits. However, this does not promote character displacement, implying a low cost of pollinator sharing. Our results highlight the importance of characterizing both traits and ecological niches in character displacement studies.

AB In their native range, Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) have strong interactions with a multitude of species due to the annual pulse of marine-derived nutrients that they deliver to streams and forests when they spawn and die. Over the past few decades, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has established non-native populations throughout the Patagonia region of southern South America. Here, we provide the first assessment of the pathways through which salmon-derived nutrients enter stream and forest food webs in Patagonia by surveying multiple streams in southern Chile to identify invertebrate and vertebrate consumers of salmon carcasses and summarizing all documented trophic interactions of Chinook salmon in Patagonia. Blowflies (Calliphoridae) were the dominant colonizer of carcasses in the riparian zone, and midge flies (Chironomidae) were the most common invertebrate on submerged carcasses. Camera trap monitoring in the riparian zone revealed consumption of carcasses or carcass-associated invertebrates by the insectivorous passerine bird "chucao" (Scelorchilis rubecula), small rodents (black rat Rattus rattus, house mouse Mus musculus, and/or colilargo Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), the South American fox "culpeo" (Lycalopex culpaeus), and the invasive American mink (Neovison vison). A mink was filmed transferring a carcass from stream to streambank, indicating that vertebrate scavenging likely increases the degree to which marine-derived nutrients enter terrestrial food webs. The native taxa that consume salmon are closely related to species that benefit from salmon consumption in North America, suggesting that the pathways of salmon nutrient incorporation in North American food webs have functionally re-emerged in South America. Similarly, non-native trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo trutta) and mink consume salmon in Patagonia, and their eco-evolutionary history of coexistence with salmon could mean that they are preadapted for salmon consumption and could thus be key beneficiaries of this invasion. Expanded monitoring of the abundance and impacts of salmon will be vital for understanding how these novel inputs of marine-derived nutrients alter Patagonian food webs.

AB The Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) is the second most exploited bivalve in the world but remains threatened by diseases and global changes. Their associated microbiota play a key role in their fitness and acclimation capacities. This study aimed at better understanding the behavior of clam digestive glands and extrapallial fluids microbiota at small, but contrasting spatial and temporal scales. Results showed that environmental variations impacted clam microbiota differently according to the considered tissue. Each clam tissue presented its own microbiota and showed different dynamics according to the intertidal position and sampling period. Extrapallial fluids microbiota was modified more rapidly than digestive glands microbiota, for clams placed on the upper and lower intertidal position, respectively. Clam tissues could be considered as different microhabitats for bacteria as they presented different responses to small-scale temporal and spatial variabilities in natural conditions. These differences underlined a more stringent environmental filter capacity of the digestive glands.

AB To identify factors that drive plant species richness in South-African savanna and explore their relative importance, we sampled plant communities across habitats differing in water availability, disturbance, and bedrock, using the Kruger National Park as a model system. We made plant inventories in 60 plots of 50 x 50 m, located in three distinct habitats: (i) at perennial rivers, (ii) at seasonal rivers with water available only during the rainy season, and (iii) on crests, at least similar to 5 km away from any water source. We predicted that large herbivores would utilise seasonal rivers' habitats less intensely than those along perennial rivers where water is available throughout the year, including dry periods. Plots on granite harboured more herbaceous and shrub species than plots on basalt. The dry crests were poorer in herb species than both seasonal and perennial rivers. Seasonal rivers harboured the highest numbers of shrub species, in accordance with the prediction of the highest species richness at relatively low levels of disturbance and low stress from the lack of water. The crests, exposed to relatively low pressure from grazing but stressed by the lack of water, are important from the conservation perspective because they harbour typical, sometimes rare savanna species, and so are seasonal rivers whose shrub richness is stimulated and maintained by the combination of moderate disturbance imposed by herbivores and position in the middle of the water availability gradient. To capture the complexity of determinants of species richness in KNP, we complemented the analysis of the above local factors by exploring large-scale factors related to climate, vegetation productivity, the character of dominant vegetation, and landscape features. The strongest factor was temperature; areas with the highest temperatures reveal lower species richness. Our results also suggest that Colophospermum mopane, a dominant woody species in the north of KNP is not the ultimate cause of the lower plant diversity in this part of the park.

AB Continued degradation of temporary wetlands and rapidly declining freshwater biodiversity call for identification of vulnerable species as targets for conservation and management efforts. Branchiopod crustaceans are endemic to temporary waters and rely on banks of drought-resistant eggs in the sediment for survival across dry seasons. These egg banks are like archives to biologists and allow them to estimate population status and resilience, without the need to sample active communities. Such an approach has, however, not yet been fully explored. Here, we investigate egg bank abundance and morpho-species richness to assess the vulnerability of branchiopod communities in dryland landscapes. For study systems, we use 98 temporary wetlands across the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, which contained eggs of Notostraca, Anostraca, Spinicaudata and Cladocera. We invoked the insurance hypothesis to investigate community resilience and studied egg bank abundance to reveal population status. Our results indicate that branchiopod communities become more vulnerable along an aridity gradient, from the semi-arid eastern regions to the arid western parts of the province. Apart from longitude, we also considered a suite of other environmental descriptors to explain variability in egg bank abundance and richness patterns and found that egg bank abundance decreased with alkalinity.

AB Soil salinization is considered an environmental threat as high salt content hinders plant growth. Soil salinity is usually associated with climate aridity at a regional scale, while topography, subsurface hydrology, and land use combine with climate to produce salinization patterns at landscape scale. In this study, the first such assessment for the study area, we investigated the relationship between climate, groundwater level (GWL) changes, and soil salinity. For comparison, two adjacent vegetation units used as marginal grazing lands were selected: thickets of Allenrolfea patagonica (Ap thicket), located at the base of a scarp, and bushes of Cyclolepis genistoides (Cg bush), located away from the topographic discontinuity. Electrical conductivity (ECrs) maps derived from LANDSAT-8/OLI were used to analyze salinity patterns. The results showed that GWL rose in coincidence with precipitation events and fell during dryer and warmer periods. GWL was always closer to the surface in the Ap thicket, and level changes were more likely to occur there. ECrs showed a seasonal pattern with significantly higher (p < 0.05) values in the Ap thicket during summer. Within the Cg bush, relatively higher ECrs appeared around a permanent water trough. Within this zone, ECrs values during summer were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Coupled evaluation of GWL dynamics and soil salinization patterns showed that GWL changes interact with land use practices to produce local-scale patterns of salinization. Topography played an important role in controlling soil surface properties through its influence on groundwater dynamics and small topographic changes produced largely different conditions for vegetation growth.

AB Mutualism benefits partner species, and theory predicts these partnerships can affect the abundance, diversity, and composition of partner and non-partner species. We used 16 years of monitoring data to determine the ant partner species of tree cholla cacti (Cylindropuntia imbricata), which reward ants with extrafloral nectar in exchange for anti-herbivore defense. These long-term data revealed one dominant ant partner (Liometopum apiculatum) and two less common partners (Crematogaster opuntiae and Forelius pruinosus). We then used short-term characterization of the terrestrial ant community by pitfall trapping to sample partner and non-partner ant species across ten plots of varying cactus density. We found that the dominant ant partner tended a higher proportion cacti in plots of higher cactus density, and was also found at higher occurrence within the pitfall traps in higher density plots, suggesting a strong positive feedback that promotes ant partner occurrence where plant partners are available. Despite the strong association and increased partner occurrence, ant community-wide effects from this mutualism appear limited. Of the common ant species, the occurrence of a single non-partner ant species was negatively associated with cactus density and with the increased presence of L. apiculatum. Additionally, the composition and diversity of the ant community in our plots were insensitive to cactus density variation, indicating that positive effects of the mutualism on the dominant ant partner did not have cascading impacts on the ant community. This study provides novel evidence that exclusive mutualisms, even those with a strong positive feedback, may be limited in the scope of their community-level effects.

AB The rapidly increasing population of human beings in semi-arid areas is often considered as a major factor of land degradation. Only a few studies have examined the dynamics of human settlements on the composition, diversity, structure and palatability of range vegetation in Southern Punjab Pakistan. The current study aims to assess whether the distance from settlements had any effect on the range vegetation's diversity and cover. In order to determine the impact of human settlements on the vegetation, the sampling area (Thal rangeland) was classified into three categories, i.e., Near (1-2 km from human communities), Away (2-4 km from human communities), and Far (4-6 km from human settlements). A total of 75 transects in all of the three sites were placed in the study sites. Along the transects, a quadrate of 1 m(2) after every 10 m was randomly placed. The study site yielded floral diversity of a total of 29 species, representing 23 genera and belonging to 9 families. Results showed that the areas away from the human communities had higher species diversity (20), while the site near to human settlements depicted lower diversity (14). It was observed that, although the site near to communities had lower diversity, it depicted higher plant density, while the highest diversity along with the lowest plant density was observed in sites away from the communities. The study concluded that the diversity of range grasses, especially desirable species, was affected by distance to human settlements. These findings could be useful to detect flora changes, establish habitat protection priorities and improve efforts for conserving natural landscapes.

AB As the Anthropocene advances, there are few parts of Earth that have not been impacted by human influence. Humans have had a long-sustained interaction with grassy ecosystems, but they are becoming severely impacted by direct and indirect impacts as the Anthropocene advances. Grassy ecosystems are easy to clear and cultivate, poorly protected, and poorly defined due to legacies of colonial narratives that can describe them as deforested, wastelands, or derived. Climate change, land conversion, and the erosion of the processes that have shaped grassy ecosystems for millennia have had cascading and cumulative impacts on grassy ecosystem extent and integrity. We examine how these changes are impacting grassy ecosystems, more specifically, those that fall into ecosystem uncertain space-a climate envelope where vegetation is not at equilibrium with climate and either grassy or forest ecosystems can occur. It is within this space that climate, CO2, and disturbances (fire, herbivores) interact to determine the presence of grassy ecosystems. Changes to any of these components reduce the integrity of grassy ecosystems. The loss of these ancient biodiverse ecosystems means loss of an array of ecosystem services fundamental to the lives of more than 1 billion people alongside Earth-system impacts of altered albedo, carbon, and hydrological cycles.

AB Biological invasions are a major threat to natural systems, as well as to human wellbeing and livelihoods. An association of alien plant species with dump sites has received limited research attention in South Africa, and this creates a loophole for effective monitoring and management. We surveyed dump sites from 79 towns/localities in the Free State, Gauteng, and the Northern Cape and North West provinces of South Africa for presence of alien plant species. We recorded 206 alien plant species classified into 50 families, and the dominant families included Cactaceae (18.5%; N = 767), Asteraceae (12.1%), Solanaceae (10.5%), and Fabaceae (8.2%). Significant numbers of herbaceous species (33.0%; N = 206), and succulents (13.6%) had been introduced from North and South America and Europe, while woody species (39.8%) came from different regions of the world. We detected significantly fewer (i.e., 3.9% N = 206) emerging alien plant species in national regulations' category 1a suggesting they may be restricted to their introduction locations, while 8.8% were species not listed in the national regulations, thus suggesting that they should be listed. The species' richness was significantly and inversely correlated with environmental temperatures of each town/locality. In support of the study prediction, the dump sites in Free State Province had the highest number of alien plant species that are unknown in the main provincial species pool (i.e., 71); Northern Cape, 42 species, while the North West and Gauteng Provinces were equal in having 10 unknown species. We conclude that a context-specific management policy is urgently required for biological invasions in dump sites as a way of reducing further invasions and their impact, and that dump sites should be considered as monitoring points in South Africa.

AB Ensuring comparability between results is a key goal of all paleoecological reconstructions. Quantitative estimates of meteorological variables, as opposed to relative qualitative descriptions, provide the opportunity to compare local paleoenvironmental records against global estimates and incrementally build regional paleoclimatic records. The Bioclimatic Method provides quantitative and qualitative estimates of past landscape composition and climate along with measures of statistical accuracy by applying linear discriminant functions analysis and transfer functions to faunal taxonomic abundance data. By applying this method to the rodent data from Geissenklosterle and Hohle Fels, two Paleolithic cave sites located in the Ach Valley of southwestern Germany, we classify the regional vegetation according to Walters' zonobiome model. We also present new estimates of meteorological variables including mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and vegetative activity period of the Ach Valley for the period spanning similar to 60,000 to 35,000 cal BP. The results suggest the Ach Valley contained a non-analogous landscape of arctic tundra and temperate deciduous woodland with occasional arid steppe expansion. Meteorological estimates suggest the climate was significantly colder during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic than today, with higher annual precipitation and dramatic temperature shifts between seasons. These results fit well with climatic reconstructions from Switzerland and the Netherlands based on a variety of proxies. They also provide further evidence of a localized climatic response within southwestern Germany to the stadial-interstadial shifts preceding the Heinrich 4 event. Finally, these results reinforce our previous claims that climatic volatility was not a driving force in the loss of Neanderthal groups throughout the Swabian Jura during OIS 3.

AB Wildlife trade policies in China and elsewhere have come under increased scrutiny following suggestions that the emergence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may have been linked to trade in wild animals. The breeding of and trade in most terrestrial wild animal species for consumption as food were prohibited in China in February 2020, but trade for non-food purposes such as ornamental items or traditional medicine continues to be covered by provisions in the Wildlife Protection Law (WPL). While a superficial reading of the WPL could lead to the conclusion that commercial trade in nationally protected species is generally prohibited, in practice key language is interpreted to permit commercial trade in the parts and derivatives of protected wild animal species, including those subject to the most stringent protection within China and internationally, such as leopards and pangolins.

AB We examined the responses of primary productivity and carbon fluxes (net ecosystem productivity, gross primary productivity, and ecosystem respiration) to climate (using open top chambers and electric heating) and species richness manipulations (by non-random species removal) in Mongolian grasslands. We observed a decreasing tendency in plant productivity and carbon flux due to warming, which would be mitigated by watering. This suggests that decrease in soil moisture due to concomitantly increasing evaporation and rain interception by open top chambers rather than increasing temperature might explain the decreasing tendency of productivity and carbon fluxes due to climate manipulations. Plant productivity was reduced only in the plots with the lowest species richness, and carbon fluxes did not change according to non-random species richness manipulations, suggesting that productivity and carbon fluxes are relatively robust to species loss. Our results would be associated with the compensation of the loss of perennial grasses and sedges by annual forbs. Such a compensatory mechanism might have caused negligible interaction effects of climate and species richness manipulations on productivity and carbon fluxes. Because our result was limited by a short experimental duration, in future studies, the long-term functional consequences of climate warming and species loss should be fully examined.

AB Traps constructed by an animal reduce the amount of energy required to seek prey. The main risk of trap-building predators is the greater uncertainty of encountering prey, owing to their immobility. Sometimes environmental characteristics do not allow them to build efficient traps, resulting in lower capture success. We observed prey escape, capture success, and behavior of two antlion species, Cueta lineosa, a habitat specialist, and Myrmeleon hyalinus, a generalist, building geometrically different traps. The traps of C. lineosa are elaborate and deep, consisting of two inverted cones, while M. hyalinus builds simple inverted cones. Prey escape was observed from traps with antlion larvae present and from artificially constructed traps without antlions. We used a 3D printer to create a replica model of both trap types, pressing the model onto the substrate surface to create a trap. The C. lineosa artificial trap slowed prey escape more effectively than the simpler artificial trap of M. hyalinus. Prey escape time was four times longer for two ant species and three times longer for woodlice from C. lineosa traps. Escape time also decreased with increasing prey length. We also found behavioral differences between these two antlion species. The behavior of M. hyalinus is much more efficient in catching prey than that of C. lineosa. The results indicate that both species are efficient trap-building predators; however, it appears that capture success depends not only on trap design but also on larval behavior.
   Antlion larvae are trap-building predators. The location of the ambush site is essential for larvae to build an effective trap, since trap characteristics significantly affect capture success. Deeper traps retain prey better and give larvae in the trap more time to grab the prey. However, sometimes the environment does not allow larvae to construct the most efficient trap, and the larvae can compensate for this by their behavior, making them successful hunters.

AB Changes of biophysical and biochemical features in canopy cover over space and time can be used to elucidate watershed resilience to climate change or extreme weather. Geospatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing are helpful to identify such vegetation dynamics. This paper investigates the landfall impact of Hurricane Irma on canopy cover in the Santa Fe River Basin (Florida), which occurred in August 2017. Specifically, this study explores the effect of Hurricane Irma on vegetation dynamics via biophysical and biochemical features during the pre and post hurricane landfall. The geospatial analysis compares a suite of remote sensing spectral indices including enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI). It is noticeable that paired spectral indices such as EVI-LST, GVMI-LST, LAI-LST, EVI-GVMI, EVI-LAI, LAI-FPAR, EVI-FPAR, and LAI-GVMI reflecting the dependent relationships between biophysical and biochemical features reveal varying level of logistic trends under Irma landfall impact. In addition, the evolution of these biophysical and biochemical features associated with the vegetation cover was analyzed in terms of the functional capacity over grassland, evergreen forested land, deciduous forested land, and agricultural land, to understand watershed response following Irma landfall. The functional capacity of the ecosystem reduced in terms of EVI and LAI over these four land-over patterns due to the landfall of Hurricane Irma. The interactions between agricultural land variation and flooding impact before and after the hurricane landfall further entail human impact on natural system in a food-water nexus.

AB Multiple invasive species may interact, influencing one another and generating synergistic effects on food webs and ecosystem processes. We investigated the interaction between two non-native species widespread in the western USA: common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), an invasive riparian tree associated with di-nitrogen fixation. Deep Creek, Idaho, was an International Biological Program site in the early 1970s; at that time, carp were rare and Russian olive was absent. Subsequently, Russian olive was introduced and established a dense stand, increasing allochthonous inputs and nitrogen-rich benthic organic matter. Since 1971, carp density has increased similar to 4x (an increase our bioenergetic analysis suggests could not have been sustained in the absence of Russian olive). Carp gut contents in 2013-2014 revealed, on average, similar to 40% olives, and, similarly, stable isotope analyses revealed similar to 58% of carp tissues were derived from olives. A small-scale, short-term experimental exclusion of these subsidized carp caused similar to 3x increases in macrophytes and chlorophyll-a, suggesting they may limit algae and macrophyte biomass. Moreover, carp that consumed olives excreted more nitrogen (similar to 2x more ammonium, similar to 2x more total dissolved nitrogen, and similar to 3x more total nitrogen) compared to those that had not, which may amplify recycling and export from streams invaded by both species. This scenario is characteristic of an "invasional meltdown," with attendant changes in food webs and ecosystem processes.

AB Biotic interactions can determine species distributions and range limits, but little theoretical background exists regarding variation in commensalistic associations across latitudes. We estimated the geographic variation of the epibiont limpet Scurria parasitica's association with its obligate host chiton species Enoplochiton niger across their distribution from Peru to northern Chile (12-30 degrees S), to test the influence of host size variation on epibiont occurrence, individual spatial distribution, and body size. We analyzed the contribution of chiton body size to the pattern of abundance and distribution of occupancy of the epibiont limpet. We also examined the relationship between limpet shell size, coverage, and incidence probability function and chiton body size across latitudes. For some localities across the range edge of the host grazer's distribution (i.e. 28-30 degrees S), incidence and densities of the epibiont limpet were higher on larger chitons. Unoccupied host chiton proportions decreased at the poleward edge of the host-epibiont species range compared with sites located to the north. Increased variation in the epibiont limpet distribution on the host chiton plates suggests that limpets' spatial segregation may have a role in lessening intraspecific interference competition with the host species at southern latitudes. Therefore, local and large-scale processes seem to contribute to modify the host-epibiont association pattern. Further studies are necessary to determine if this association shifts from commensalistic to antagonistic across the distributional range of both species.

AB The introduction of artificial water sources for livestock uses in ecosystems where water has been absent during their evolution has caused changes in vegetation. It has been proven that there is a radial mitigation of grazing impact with the distance between the water sources, which encourages the formation of piospheres. In Argentina, there are no studies that evaluate how climate acts as a modulator of the effects of grazing in piospheres along environmental gradients. The objective of this study was to evaluate and analyze the role that climate plays as a modulator of effects that grazing induces on a local scale. This would allow us to understand how the climate acts on the effects of grazing. For that, 77 piospheres were selected along a climatic gradient that covers arid and semi-arid areas of Argentina and the spatial variability of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values in the grazing gradient were analyzed as well as its relationship with mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. Two different patterns of NDVI response were observed within the grazing gradient. Pattern 1 presented an increase in NDVI with distance to the water point, while pattern 2 showed a reverse effect. The piospheres of patterns 1 and 2 were located above and below 280 mm of annual precipitation and 14.5 degrees C of mean annual temperature, respectively. These results suggest that there is a differential effect of grazing on vegetation, and that this effect is modulated by climatic variables.

AB Simple Summary Sustainable wildlife management (SWM), based on traditional practice supported with advances in scientific knowledge and evolving economic and social circumstances, has shaped the global approach to wildlife management and policy. In this paper, we report the findings of a large semi-structured questionnaire in China which investigated the attitude of the urban public toward sustainable wildlife management and wildlife conservation across a range of issues and identified the key socio-economic and demographic factor drivers for those attitudes. The survey was conducted from November 2018 to October 2020, across 15 cities randomly selected among China's seven administrative geographic regions. The survey was initially conducted through face-to-face interviews, but later, due to COVID-19 restrictions, was completed via online questionnaires. The results show that the public are broadly supportive of the theory of SWM, but their enthusiasm is issue- and context-dependent. For example, on issues of "Animal Welfare and Rights," "Wildlife Utilization and Captive Breeding," and "Trophy Hunting", the public demonstrate antagonistic views about SWM, demonstrating an affinity for "Compassionate Conservation". We also found that demographic characteristics of the public can significantly influence attitude, with those respondents who are not vegetarian or religious, who have higher levels of education, or are younger in age being more likely to appreciate the rational science approach of SWM. Our research suggests that conservation organisations may need to adapt their management aims and practices to avoid direct conflict with the rising tide of animal rights sentiment. Furthermore, significant investment will be required to promote science-based conservation in social marketing on all social media platforms to help educate and engage the public with the science behind conservation management. Sustainable wildlife management (SWM) is based on a synergy of traditional/local knowledge, advances in scientific knowledge, and fast-evolving economic and social circumstances. A widely accepted cornerstone of SWM globally is that conservation and utilization need to be effectively integrated, emphasizing the benefits humans can derive from biodiversity, thereby further encouraging people to protect and value wildlife though its management. However, with demand from biological resources growing at an unprecedented rate and the emergence of social media, conservationists must respond quickly to new challenges and conflicts associated with species management and public policy. For example, the rise of the "Compassionate Conservation" (CC) movement, fueled by social marketing and media, which promotes the welfare of individual animals, has introduced a set of challenges for conventional conservation management as it opposes most or all forms of wildlife utilization and hunting. CC advocates are increasingly influential at global and national policy levels; hence, it is imperative that conservationists are informed and aware of the future challenges from a rapidly changing global society. In this paper, we report the findings of a large semi-structured questionnaire in China which investigated the attitude of the urban public toward sustainable wildlife management (SWM) and wildlife conservation across a range of issues and identified the key socio-economic and demographic factor drivers for those attitudes.
   The survey was conducted from November 2018 to October 2020, across 15 cities randomly selected among China's seven administrative geographic regions. The survey was initially conducted through face-to-face interviews, but later, due to COVID-19 restrictions, was completed via online questionnaires. A Likert seven-point scale method was used to score the public's degree of agreement or disagreement for each question; a multivariate stepwise linear regression method was used to analyze whether the overall attitude of the respondents toward SWM and wildlife conservation was affected by their demographic characteristics; and a classification and regression tree (CART) was used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the issues with negative scores in the questionnaire, so as to understand how the respondents' demographic characteristics affected the public's attitude about such issues, which could supplement results obtained from the multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis. The results show that the public are broadly supportive of SWM, but only moderately so. On issues of "Animal Welfare and Rights," "Wildlife Utilization and Captive Breeding," and "Trophy Hunting", the core concerns of the "Compassionate Conservation" movement and the overall public view are more antagonistic to conventional SWM. We also find specific demographic characteristics significantly influence attitudes about SWM, with vegetarians, those with religious beliefs, and with lower educational standards demonstrating weaker support for SWM. For younger people, "Animal Welfare and Rights" is a special concern, hence, we identify this as a key issue to be addressed for SWM and conservation in the future. Our research suggests that conservation organisations may need to adapt their management aims and practices to avoid direct conflict with the rising tide of animal rights sentiment, especially among the young. Furthermore, significant investment will be required to promote science-based conservation in social marketing on all social media platforms to help educate and engage the public with the science behind conservation management.

AB Simple Summary The widespread dissemination of information related to wildlife utilization in new online media and traditional media undoubtedly impacts societal conservation concepts and attitudes, thus triggering public discussions on the relationship between conservation and utilization. In this study, questionnaires were distributed in seven major geographic regions of Chinese mainland to investigate the public's awareness and agreement with information related to the utilization of wildlife in order to measure the impact of information on various issues relating wildlife conservation and utilization. The Chinese public had the greatest awareness and agreement with information that prevents unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the least awareness and agreement with information that promotes unsustainable utilization. It is also noteworthy that the Chinese public have higher levels of awareness and agreement with information that does not support utilization than with information that supports sustainable utilization. From our research, we can conclude that overall the public tends to support and be informed by a purist view of conservation, and there is significantly less support for conservation based on sustainable utilization. On this basis, we suggest that in the future, conservation education should seek to balance the public's respect and love for nature which is often inspired by social media, with more scientific information about scientific understandings that influence conservation policy and practice. The widespread dissemination of information related to wildlife utilization in new online media and traditional media undoubtedly impacts societal conservation concepts and attitudes, thus triggering public discussions on the relationship between conservation and utilization. A study on how public attitudes and concepts are affected by the related information on wildlife utilization is helpful to implement the scientific wildlife conservation and management strategies, and to propose targeted measures to optimize the information environment. We designed the questionnaire to investigate the public's awareness and agreement with related information on wildlife utilization so as to measure how information with different dissemination channels, source types, and content orientation influenced the public's concept of wildlife conservation and utilization. The questionnaire was distributed in seven major geographical regions throughout China. Out of a total of 1645 questionnaires that were collected, 1294 questionnaires were valid, with an effective rate of 78.7%. Results show that respondents had the greatest awareness of information on preventing unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the lowest awareness of information on promoting unsustainable utilization, and that awareness of information that against utilization was higher than that of information which supported sustainable utilization. At the same time, respondents showed the greatest agreement for information on preventing unsustainable utilization and the lowest agreement for information on promoting unsustainable utilization; also, their agreement with information that against utilization was higher than that for information which supported sustainable use. Respondents had a high level of awareness of information on wildlife related to COVID-19 provided by experts.
   Gender, age, the level of development of the city in which they live, education, vegetarianism, and religious beliefs all affected respondents' agreement with related information on wildlife utilization.
   This research suggests that the publicity and education of scientific conservation methods should be emphasized in the future conservation education. In addition, scholars in the field of wildlife research should assume the role of 'influencer' and give full play to the scientific guidance of public opinion.

AB Mapping vegetation communities requires considerable investment in field data collection, analysis and interpretation. The methods for data collection and analysis can significantly affect field time and the accuracy of the classifications. We test the ability of field data subsets and data pre-treatments to reproduce an intuitively derived vegetation classification within the Australian tropical savanna biome. The data subsets include all strata, upper strata, ground strata, and tree basal area. A range of multivariate techniques were used to describe patterns in the datasets as they related to the a priori vegetation classification. We tested the degree of floristic correlation among the data subsets and the extent to which several data transformations (square root, fourth root, presence or absence) improved the level of agreement between the numerically and the intuitively derived mapping units. Our results implied high redundancy in sampling both basal area and upper strata species cover, and the ground stratum was poorly correlated with the upper stratum. Across all statistical tests, the groups derived from analysis of square root-transformed upper stratum cover data were closely aligned with the expert classification. We propose that a numerical approach using an optimal dataset will produce a meaningful classification for vegetation mapping in poorly known Australian tropical savanna.

AB Context Landscape and local factors govern tree regeneration across heterogeneous post-fire forest environments. But their relative influence is unclear-limiting the degree that managers can consider landscape context when delegating resources to help stand-replacing patches restock successfully. Objectives We investigated how landscape and local factors shape tree regeneration across heterogeneous post-fire forest environments. Our research questions were: What is the relative influence of landscape and local factors on tree species presence (RQ1) and stocking density (RQ2) at stand-replacing patches? Do thresholds occur when landscape factors are influential (RQ3)? Methods We sampled landscape and local variables at 71 plots near Jackson, Wyoming, United States. We used Random Forests to investigate how local and landscape variables affect post-fire tree recovery. Relative influence was determined using mean decrease in accuracy. Partial dependence plots were used to visualize whether thresholds occurred for variables with mean decrease in accuracy > 15%. Results Landscape factors like seed source area were associated with subalpine fir presence and stocking density. But different thresholds occurred. Specifically, subalpine fir presence required 10% seed source area, while stocking density required 40%. Northeast aspects surrounded by > 10% seed source area were most likely to support subalpine fir presence. Conversely, local factors like soil nutrients were associated with lodgepole pine presence, highlighting effects of different regeneration strategies. Conclusions Landscape factors bolster spatial resilience and help stand-replacing patches restock naturally. But landscape factors do not support tree regeneration equally across heterogeneous post-fire forest environments. Consequently, considering stand-replacing patches in their landscape context will be critical for future spatial action planning.

AB Environmental challenges in the form of temperature extremes and unusual precipitation, which may lead to prolonged periods outside the thermoneutral zone, can be detrimental to animal physiology. Chacma baboons in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa, one of the highest latitudes at which nonhuman primates are found, experience extremes of both temperature and rainfall, as well as seasonal differences in day length that require animals to condense their daily routine into dramatically reduced daylight hours. Here we examine the effects of these climatic factors on the behavior (activity budgets and foraging patterns) and physiology (fecal glucocorticoid concentrations) of adult females (N = 33) in three groups of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) inhabiting the Cape Peninsula, where temperatures ranged from 7 to 39 degrees C, monthly rainfall ranged from 2 to 158 mm, and day length varied by 4.5 h across seasons. Climatic variables showed a clear relationship to female baboon glucocorticoid concentrations, which significantly increased with lower temperatures, higher rainfall and shorter day lengths. Activity budgets also differed between summer and winter, with females generally spending less time socializing, moving and resting in the winter compared to summer, with some differences between troops in their feeding-related activities. Cold temperatures accompanied by rainfall and short day lengths may thus represent an ecological constraint for this population. This study highlights the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on the physiology, behavior, and, ultimately, survival of wildlife populations.

AB Novel interactions between introduced and native species commonly occur and can even be predicted from existing native interactions in a certain area. However, novel interactions between two species both alien to a region are less common and can result in intriguing relationships. In this study, we investigate how the North American honey locust Gleditsia triacanthos might benefit from a novel interaction with an Asian monophagous seed beetle Megabruchidius dorsalis, which recently switched its host, in the introduced range of Europe. The honey locust tree is a popular ornamental in Europe and has been reported to escape cultivated areas. We observed spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, saplings, and young trees in the wider urban area of Maribor, Slovenia. We collected mature honey locust pods at several locations and investigated the possible reasons for dormancy break in physically dormant seeds and their successful germination in an urban environment by performing imbibition and germination experiments with variously treated seeds. Our results show that the success of honey locust imbibition and germination can be related to M. dorsalis larva acting as a scarifying agent and thus breaking the seed dormancy, delaying germination, and enabling asynchronous germination. However, the beneficial effect of larvae on germination is possible only if the larva drills the entrance hole, but dies before the seed germinates. Here we show that novel interaction established can occasionally act as mutual facilitation in which each species aids the other to exist and even to increase their invasion success.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Encroachment of woody plants has negative effects on grass species and seriously challenging livestock production and pastoral livelihood in semi-arid savanna. The effect of thinning and season on grass species composition and biomass was investigated in lowland grazing area for three seasons. The study consisted of 15 plots (each 50 m x 50 m), thinned to differing intensities. The plots were located next to each other on a homogeneous area of 3.8 ha. Five thinning intensities (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) were allocated randomly to the plots and replicated three times. The 0% plot was left unthinned referred to as the control plot. The remaining plots were thinned to the equivalents of 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the tree density of that of the control plot. A two-way analysis of variance and Tukey Honest Significant Differences tests were used to compare responses of grass species. Ordination of variables was carried out by multivariate technique using correspondence analysis to explore the similarity relationship of plots, seasons and species. The differences in species composition and biomass in the control and the thinned plots were significant (p < 0.05). Higher grass species composition and biomass were documented in thinned plots than in the control plot. Species abundance in thinned plots ranged from 11 to 12, while that of the 0% plot was six species. Grass biomass (Kg ha-1) varied from 2,688.4 +/- 736.8 to 5,035.8 +/- 743.9 across thinned plots, whereas in the control plot the yield was 885.8 +/- 369.1. The result showed that grass species composition and biomass increased with the increasing intensity of thinning. Grass values appeared to be optimum at the heavy intensity of thinning woody plants. Seasons were also significant with the highest values recorded in the rainy season. Rainfall played an important role by interacting with thinning and influenced total grass values. Overall, thinning that combined improved soil moisture negatively influenced woody cover and enhanced grass species composition and biomass production. Thinning of bushes to the 75% of tree density would sustain the original savanna and maximize forage production for grazers.

AB Treeless grasslands occur within landscapes that are predominantly wooded savannas in the central Kruger National Park, South Africa. As a first step in identifying soil properties potentially underpinning differences in vegetation structure in these landscapes, we analysed the soil chemistry of the pedoderm (0-2 cm) in a grassland and two adjacent savanna types (Senegalia savanna and Delagoa Lowveld). The grassland was significantly enriched in P, Ca, Mg and Cu relative to both the savannas (1.8- and 5.8-fold for the Senegalia and Delagoa Lowveld savannas, respectively, for P; 1.8- and 5.7-fold for Ca; 1.7- and 6.0-fold for Mg; and 1.3- and 9.4-fold for Cu). It was also richer in Na (4.7-fold), Mn (6.3-fold) and Zn (1.6-fold) than the Delagoa Lowveld savanna. The competitive strength and nutritive value of the herbaceous layer in the grassland is likely to be greater than in the savannas because of the relative nutrient richness of the grassland's pedoderm. Herbivory pressure is also likely to be greater in the grassland because of the greater nutritive value of the herbaceous layer. These effects provide a plausible mechanism for the constraint of trees in the grassland.

AB Woody plant expansion is one of the greatest contemporary threats to fire-dependent ecosystems. Reducing woody plant prevalence is often a primary objective of prescribed burns, yet little attention has been given to understanding the efficacy of burning to reduce their abundance. Fire intensity characteristics and plant phenology/physiology, which are sometimes presented as competing hypotheses, influence how woody plants respond to a fire event. Little work has been done in the prairie-forest region of the upper Midwest to understand how fire characteristics interact with woody species phenology and/or physiology. Using a controlled field experiment, we examined effects of timing (seasonality) and intensity (temperature and duration) of fires on top-kill and resprouting of three invasive woody plants in this region (common buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica; bush honeysuckles, Lonicera spp.; and a native species, northern pin oak Quercus ellipsoidalis). Honeysuckles and pin oak burned in the spring dormant period, a common practice in the region, resulted in low levels of top-kill and high levels of resprouting. Burning during the late growing season yielded highest levels of top-kill and lowest levels of resprouting for honeysuckles and pin oaks. However, there was no apparent effect of season or fire intensity treatment for buckthorn stems. Under all treatment combinations, buckthorn was easily top-killed but resprouted prolifically. Collectively, most prescribed burning in the Midwest appears to be conducted during the least effective season (early growing season), when top-kill is reduced and/or resprouting most pronounced. Our results indicate that fire use could be better prescribed in this region for controlling woody plants.

AB When multiple species of host-specific natural enemies from the same feeding guild are introduced to areas against a target pest, strong interspecific competition is likely and may compromise biocontrol unless the agents effectively partition available resources. Here, we evaluate if two parasitoids (Spathius galinae and Tetrastichus planipennisi), introduced for biocontrol of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis, into North America have established niche-partitioning, co-existing populations following their sequential or simultaneous field releases to 12 hard-wood forests located in Midwest and Northeast regions of the United States. We found the two recently introduced EAB larval parasitoids, S. galinae and T. planipennisi, established niche-partitioning, co-existing populations in all release areas. Presence, abundance, and/or host attack (parasitism) rates of the two parasitoid species differed significantly among ash tree-size classes, with S. galinae parasitism more abundant in larger diameter and pole-size trees, while T. planipennisi dominated in saplings. We also found the abundance of EAB larvae declined significantly with height in both ash saplings and pole-size trees, whereas the abundance of S. galinae and T. planipennisi broods was unaffected. However, the abundance of both larval parasitoid species was strongly and positively correlated with EAB larval abundance in sampled sections of their preferred tree-size classes. Our findings suggest that the two introduced specialist parasitoids, S. galinae and T. planipennisi, complement one another in protecting trees of different size classes against EAB.

AB The biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem exert an influence on the behavior and survival of organisms, which adapt to changes in these factors to ensure their reproduction and survival. Phenotypic plasticity regards any type of change induced by the environment without the need for genetic modifications. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the investment of the antlion, Myrmeleon brasiliensis (Neuroptera, Myrmeleontidae) in trap building is a phenotypic response that changes according to the surrounding environment. Larvae were observed in their natural environment (control), in a simulated natural environment (below tents) and after being transplanted to the laboratory. We found that the investment in trap size is a plastic phenotypic response in M. brasiliensis larvae and this behavior varies in accordance with the location in which the larvae build their traps. In areas with protection for the traps, greater investment was made in the size of the trap and consequently increased the success in capturing prey.

AB Temporal variability of plant-pollinator interactions is important for fully understanding the structure, function, and stability of plant-pollinator networks, but most network studies so far have ignored within-day dynamics. Strong diel dynamics (e.g., a regular daily cycle) were found for networks with Cichorieae, which typically close their flowers around noon. Here, we experimentally prevented early flower closure to test whether these dynamics are driven by the temporally limited availability of Cichorieae, or by timing of pollinator activity. We further tested if the dynamics involving Cichorieae and their pollinators also affect the dynamics on other plants in the network. Finally, we explored the structure of such manipulated networks (with Cichorieae available in the morning and afternoon) compared to unmanipulated controls (Cichorieae available only in the morning). We found that flower closure of Cichorieae is indeed an important driver of diel network dynamics, while other drivers of pollinator timing appeared less important. If Cichorieae flowers were available in the afternoon, they were visited by generalist and specialist pollinators, which overall decreased link turnover between morning and afternoon. Effects of afternoon availability of Cichorieae on other plants in the network were inconclusive: pollinator switching to and from Cichorieae tended to increase. On the level of the aggregated (full-day) network, the treatment resulted in increased dominance of Cichorieae, reducing modularity and increasing plant generality. These results highlight that network dynamics can be predicted by knowledge of diel or seasonal phenology, and that fixed species timing assumptions will misrepresent the expected dynamics.

AB Context Describing the hydrogeomorphic character of rivers in a holistic way is essential to understanding the processes whereby freshwater ecosystems maintain patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. A key question in carrying out this characterisation is the temporal and spatial scales which best represent differences and similarities between habitats. Objectives The purpose of this study is to describe the hydrological and geomorphological character of a large river-floodplain system (the Upper Mississippi River, USA) at multiple spatial and temporal scales in order to holistically determine the physical template influencing the riverine ecosystem. Methods Seventeen variables are used to describe the hydrogeomorphic character of 99 backwaters and floodplain lakes along a 100 km reach of the river. Results At the landscape scale (10 s of km), position in the landscape and proximity to neighbouring habitats contributed most to variability in hydrogeomorphic character. At the smaller patch scale (10-100 s of m), the shape of entry to the patch and water depth were distinguishing variables. In relation to temporal variables, habitats are distinguished by decadal scale variables describing the historic nature of the rise and fall of connection events, and mean peak and duration of connection over long periods. In contrast, the interplay of magnitude and duration of individual connection events produced unique patterns at the short-term temporal scale (intra-annual). Analysis of all variables across all scales showed that no variable from one scale of observation was dominant, rather variables from multiple scales are contributing to hydrogeomorphic character to varying degrees. Conclusions This work demonstrates how an interdisciplinary, multi-scale approach is critical in detecting unique patterns in hydrogeomorphic character across different spatial and temporal scales. This approach enables a holistic view of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of a system and provides a firm basis for investigating how the physical template influences and helps to maintain patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in complex and dynamics systems.

AB The global decline in plant biodiversity throughout recent human history has attracted broad scientific attention, as biodiversity plays a key role in promoting a productive ecosystem. Pollination is a major factor in plant survival but carries an additional cost for locally rare plant species: they are likely to receive high levels of incompatible pollen that does not contribute to reproduction and can even impair seed production. Therefore, floral traits that diminish the risk of incompatible pollen receipt may be favoured by natural selection.
   We developed a theoretical framework to explore the influence of floral morphological complexity on competition for pollinator services between self-incompatible simultaneously flowering plant species.
   We show that when a rare plant species is morphologically complex, it may persist in competition with a more common species.
   Synthesis. The results show that, through its influence on pollinator foraging behaviour, complex floral morphology can contribute to the maintenance of plant diversity.

AB The federally threatened American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is a flagship species and ecological indicator of hydrologic restoration in the Florida Everglades. We conducted a long-term capture-recapture study on the South Florida population of American crocodiles from 1978 to 2015 to evaluate the effects of restoration efforts to more historic hydrologic conditions. The study produced 10,040 crocodile capture events of 9,865 individuals and more than 90% of captures were of hatchlings. Body condition and growth rates of crocodiles were highly age-structured with younger crocodiles presenting with the poorest body condition and highest growth rates. Mean crocodile body condition in this study was 2.14 +/- 0.35 SD across the South Florida population. Crocodiles exposed to hypersaline conditions (> 40 psu) during the dry season maintained lower body condition scores and reduced growth rate by 13% after one year, by 24% after five years, and by 29% after ten years. Estimated hatchling survival for the South Florida population was 25% increasing with ontogeny and reaching near 90% survival at year six. Hatchling survival was 34% in NE Florida Bay relative to a 69% hatchling survival at Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge and 53% in Flamingo area of Everglades National Park. Hypersaline conditions negatively affected survival, growth and body condition and was most pronounced in NE Florida Bay, where the hydrologic conditions have been most disturbed. The American crocodile, a long-lived animal, with relatively slow growth rate provides an excellent model system to measure the effects of altered hydropatterns in the Everglades landscape. These results illustrate the need for continued long-term monitoring to assess system-wide restoration outcomes and inform resource managers.

AB Seabird colonies exert a strong influence on coastal ecosystems, increasing soil nitrogen bioavailability and modifying plant communities. Previous studies have evidenced that increased N in soils leads to changes in plant cell wall composition; however, this effect has not been assessed in seabird colonies. The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of seabird colonies on nitrogen, cellulose and lignin content in cell walls. For this purpose, analyses were performed on droppings, soils and three native plant species (Armeria pubigera, Armeria pungens and Corema album) growing in yellow-legged gull colonies. The results showed that N excreted by yellow-legged gull is assimilated by plants, increases N content in plant tissues and reduces cellulose and lignin synthesis, therefore potentially altering plant resistance against phytoparasites.

AB Exotic pet trading and keeping raises many concerns regarding animal welfare, species conservation, eco-logical alteration, invasive species, public health and safety, and other issues. Despite these concerns, the UK Government assigns greater consultation importance to exotic pet trading and keeping stakeholders than to parties that seek to remedy relevant problems, or to independent experts. To help ameliorate the current situation, we propose a model government advisory protocol in which consultation weight is assigned first to independent scientific parties; secondly to animal welfare parties; and thirdly to ex-otic pet trading and keeping parties. Relatedly, we present two case studies as illustrative examples, that: A. examine UK government and other national approaches to stakeholder consultations; and B. compare differences in scale between stakeholders for the exotic pet trade and hobby, animal welfare, and in-dependent expert sectors based on respective numbers of employees, registered supporters, and social media followers. We conclude that current UK and some other protocols are wrongly skewed towards exotic pet trading and keeping practices, and may be causally-related to the long-standing and growing concerns regarding problematic issues, and that relevant animal welfare parties greatly outweigh exotic pet trading and keeping parties, which further suggests that consultation bias towards the exotic pet trading and keeping sector is disproportionate.

AB Many benthic animals begin life with a planktonic larval stage during which coastal currents may move individuals far from shore. This trait is believed to allow individuals to develop away from nearshore predators and sibling competition, based on the assumption that mortality rates are weaker offshore. However, larvae developing offshore often fail to locate suitable coastal habitats. This results in a trade-off between nearshore mortality and offshore wastage with consequences for larval delivery to adult habitats that have not been fully appreciated. We use a reaction-diffusion model to show that when the nearshore larval mortality rate is high, larval supply can vary more than 10-fold with the offshore mortality rate. If this offshore rate is weak, then larval supply is maximized by an intermediate diffusion rate or larval duration. While a low-diffusivity coastal boundary layer typically improves the larval supply by decreasing wastage, it can also reduce the larval supply by preventing individuals from exploiting low offshore mortality rates. Finally, the cross-shore structure of the mortality rate may influence the alongshore transport of larvae by determining how far offshore they reside prior to settling, and, consequently, the alongshore currents they experience. Our observations contrast with the prior argument that larval supply decreases with diffusivity and larval duration due to wastage, and challenge the widespread decision to omit cross-shore heterogeneity from studies of alongshore movement. Scenarios in which spatial variability in the mortality rate has a large effect on recruitment are important both for understanding the biological consequences of the larval stage and from a modeling perspective.

AB Pollinators can mediate facilitative or competitive relationships between plant species, but the relative importance of these two conflicting phenomena in shaping community-wide pollinator resource use remains unexplored. This article examines the idea that the arrangement of large samples of plant species in Hutchinsonian pollinator niche space (n-dimensional hypervolume whose axes represent pollinator types) can help to evaluate the comparative importance of facilitation and competition as drivers of pollinator resource use at the community level. Pollinator composition data were gathered for insect-pollinated plants from the Sierra de Cazorla mountains (southeastern Spain), comprising similar to 95% of widely distributed insect-pollinated species. The following questions were addressed at regional (45 sites, 221 plant species) and local (1 site, 73 plant species) spatial scales: (1) Do plant species clusters occur in pollinator niche space? Four pollinator niche spaces differing in dimensionality were considered, the axes of which were defined by insect orders, families, genera, and species. (2) If all plant species form a single, indivisible cluster, are they overdispersed or underdispersed within the cluster relative to a random arrangement? "Clusterability" tests failed to reject the null hypothesis that there was only one pollinator-defined plant species cluster in pollinator niche space, irrespective of spatial scale, pollinator niche space, or pollinator importance measurement (proportions of pollinator individuals or flowers visited by each pollinator type). Observed means of interspecific dissimilarity in pollinator composition were smaller than randomly simulated values in the order-, family-, and genus-defined pollinator niche spaces. This finding revealed an underdispersed arrangement of plant species in each of these pollinator niche spaces. In the undisturbed montane habitats studied, arrangement of insect-pollinated plant species in the various niche spaces defined by pollinator composition did not support a major role for interspecific competition as a force shaping community-wide pollinator resource use by plants, but rather suggested a situation closer to the facilitation-dominated extreme in a hypothetical competition-facilitation gradient. Results also highlight the importance of investigations on complete or nearly complete insect-pollinated plant communities for suggesting and testing novel hypotheses on the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator systems.

AB The fossil-fuelled Anthropocene, with its attendant destruction of wildlife, originated with global capitalism. Early 'fortress' conservation efforts focussed on delineating protected areas, but in the latter part of the twentieth century, wildlife expanded on private and communal lands in Southern Africa through schemes allowing people to benefit directly from wildlife. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) provided people with economic incentives to coexist with wildlife, showing that in the capitalist Anthropocene, the commodification of wildlife could be a tool for its conservation. This paper reviews the history of CBNRM in Southern Africa, paying particular attention to Namibia where hunting is an important source of revenue. It concludes with a discussion of international efforts to decommodify wildlife through limiting trade and restricting trophy hunting. The shooting of 'Cecil the Lion' in Zimbabwe by an American trophy hunter boosted these efforts - but in the process threatened to undermine commodified forms of wildlife conservation, including CBNRM, across Southern Africa. It is an irony of history that capitalist commodification created the environmental crisis yet strategies of decommodification could prompt land-use changes which, in the absence of substantial new support to promote coexistence with wildlife, reduce rather than support wildlife and biodiversity.

AB There is a renewed interest to improve sustainable wood production from African savanna but our knowledge on management of individual tree species to optimize harvesting return times is limited. A factorial experiment was therefore established to assess the effects of stump diameter and height, and coppice thinning on growth and yield of Albizia harveyi Fourn (Ah) and Albizia versicolor Welw ex. Oliver. (Av) in Forest Reserve (FR) and the General Land (GL) at area in Morogoro region, Tanzania. Coppice diameter and height growth was significantly high in Av than Ah; and was highest in stumps cut at 30 cm or 90 cm regardless of tree species. Ah had significantly high average coppicing effectiveness (11.74 coppices per stump) than Av (4.18 coppices per stump) in the FR; but the variation was not significant in the GL. Coppice wood basic density was significantly high in Ah (446.04 +/- 0.72 kg m(-3)) than Av (400.52 +/- 0.97 kg m(-3)). Coppice wood biomass ranged from 3.08 +/- 0.02 kg stool(-1) in Ah to 3.45 +/- 0.03 kg stool(-1) in Av. Ah produced highest coppice wood biomass in medium diameter stumps cut at 30 cm (3.57 kg stool(-1)) or 90 cm (3.76 kg stool(-1)) and large stumps cut at 5 cm (4.55 kg stool(-1)); and the least biomass in small stumps cut at 5 cm (1.26 kg stool(-1)). For Av, highest coppice wood biomass values were 6.41 kg stool(-1) for medium diameter stumps cut at 90 cm and 6.20 kg stool(-1) for large stumps cut at 30 cm; and the least was 1.87 kg stool(-1) for small stumps cut at 5 cm. This paper concludes with discussion on the need for further studies on optimal canopy cover and wild fire control strategies under short-rotation coppice silvicultural system; and suitability of multipurpose indigenous trees for simultaneous on-farm production.

AB Wildlife provides food, medicine, clothing, and other necessities for humans, but overexploitation can disrupt the sustainability of wildlife resources and severely threaten global biodiversity. Understanding the characteristics of consumer behavior is helpful for wildlife managers and policy makers, but the traditional survey methods are laborious and time-consuming. In contrast, culturomics may more efficiently identify the features of wildlife consumption. As a case study of the culturomics approach, we examined tiger bone wine consumption in China based on social media and Baidu search engine data. Tiger bone wine is one of the most purchased tiger products; its consumption is closely related to tiger poaching, which greatly threatens wild tiger survival. We searched a popular social media website for the term "tiger bone wine" and focused on posts that were originally created from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2018. We filtered and classified posts related to the purchase, sale, or consumption of tiger bone wine and extracted information on providers, consumption motivations, year of production, and place of origin of the tiger bone wines based on the texts and photos of these posts. We found 756 posts related to tiger bone wine consumption, 113 of which mentioned providers of tiger bone wine, including friends (53%), elder relatives (37%), peer relatives (7%), and others (3%). Out of the 756 posts, 266 indicated the motivations of tiger bone wine consumption. Tiger bone wines were consumed as a tonic (34%), medicine (23%), game product (30%), and a symbol of wealth (28%). Some posts indicated >= 2 consumption motivations. These findings were consistent with the search queries from Baidu index. Such information could help develop targeted strategies for tiger conservation. The culturomics approach illustrated by our study is a rapid and cost-efficient way to characterize wildlife consumption.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae require not only dry and loose sand, but also other abiotic factors for beneficial pit site selection. Although wet soil is generally avoided by antlions, we assumed that antlion larvae of Baliga micans (McLachlan) (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) prefer some degree of soil moisture because their relatively higher respiratory rate may cause water loss. We conducted behavioral experiments for pit construction in soils of different moisture content (0-29%) to quantitatively clarify soil moisture preference. Under the control containing only dry soil, some larvae died, no pits were frequently found, and larval weight decreased. The larvae constructed pits on the wet soil more frequently than on the dry soil. Particularly, the 2nd- and 3rd-instar larvae preferred the 9% soil and the 17% soil moisture, respectively. Therefore, the larvae showed soil moisture preference, owing to a probable physiological constraint. The soil moisture preference that secures the survival period is possibly a requisite trait for effective foraging.

AB Assessing the ecological effectiveness of protected areas is a high priority in conservation biology and requires suitable indicators. Instead of using multiple species, single species can potentially be used as indicators to assess if conservation efforts are effective in maintaining species over time. Here, we assessed the suitability of ostrich (Struthio cainelus massaicus) population densities and trends over time as indicators for the ecological effectiveness of four study areas (two national parks, a pastoral area, and a game-controlled area with manifold human impacts) in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem of northern Tanzania. Based on road transect surveys from 2011 to 2019, we estimated area- and season-specific population densities in a distance sampling framework and estimated temporal changes using generalized linear mixed models. Ostrich population densities and population trends over time were not associated with formal protection status. Ostriches in one national park occurred at highest densities and were constant over time, while densities were low in another national park and apparently declined over time. Ostriches in the pastoral area had the second-highest mean population density, while remaining constant over time. The study area with the highest human impact had lowest ostrich densities and a seemingly declining trend over time. Ostrich densities were positively correlated with time-matched population density estimates of nine out of ten ungulate species in the same study areas, suggesting that ostrich population densities broadly reflect those of large savanna mammals in this ecosystem. However, site-specific ostrich population trends over time were not closely correlated with trends of common large mammal species. Therefore, ostrich population densities appear as suitable management indicators to assess the broad ecological effectiveness of protected areas. However, ostrich population trajectories do not appear suitable as indicator surrogate to monitor trends of mammal populations over time.

AB The introduction of exotic species can generate changes in the composition of organic debris of alien origin in aquatic ecosystems close to the places of introduction. This new debris can cause impacts at the level of communities and ecosystems. Therefore, the present work aims to answer the following question: are the macroinvertebrate communities present in substrates formed by leaves of the exotic species Pinus caribaea Morelet (Pinaceae) and Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden (Myrtaceae) similar to those found in substrates composed by the mix of these two species and substrates composed by a mix of native species? For the collection of macroinvertebrates, sets of four types of artificial substrates were submerged in a stream inside the Ecological Station of Panga (Uberlandia-MG, Brazil). The treatments were: leaves of P. caribaea, leaves of E. grandis, leaves of both exotic species and leaves of two native species. In the 20 sample units, about 250 individuals were found, belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Heteroptera, Megaloptera, Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. The effects of the treatments were observed in the exponential decay of the substrate mass and in the structure of the benthic macroinvertebrates communities. The composition of these communities differed among treatments, with high dissimilarity observed between P. caribaea treatments and the mix of exotic species. Therefore, the results demonstrate the importance of substrate complexity for benthic macroinvertebrates, as well as the possible effects of biological invasion and co-invasion by species widely used in silviculture activities.

AB Unprovoked mouth gaping behavior is ubiquitous throughout 24 extant members of Crocodylia, yet information on gaping is limited. Proposed hypotheses for gaping include thermoregulation and the evaluation of potential environmental conditions. To determine temperature effects, we tracked head surface (T-sh), body surface (T-sb), and ambient (T-a) temperatures with insolation utilization and positions. To evaluate potential environmental stimuli, we tested behavioral effects (i.e., open-eye frequency) and recorded conspecific presence, day and night events, and interaction with flies and fish. We included 24 extant species representatives, with detailed assessments of American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), Crocodylus siamensis, Crocodylus intermedius, Crocodylus rhombifer, and Crocodylus halli. Observations occurred during a range of T-a (3.89-32.22 degrees C) with mean T-sb consistently higher than both T-sb and T-a across all crocodilians. Differences in T(sh )and T-sb were most pronounced with head in the sun. However, no significant differences in T-sh and T-sb were detected for A. mississippiensis and Cr. siamensis. Conversely, Cr. halli, Cr. intermedius, and Cr. rhombifer demonstrated statistically higher T-ab. Gaping with open eyes was more common, yet modeling suggested a relationship with dosed eyes and temperature. Anecdotal observations indicated weather changes may elicit mouth gaping, and we report the second nocturnal mouth gaping observation (the first for three species). Overall, mixed results indicated unprovoked mouth gaping is a complex behavior, making it difficult to draw clear cause and effect relationships. 'Future research may benefit from a focus on natural history and quantitative behavioral studies.

AB Background Natural populations inhabiting the rocky intertidal experience multiple ecological stressors and provide an opportunity to investigate how environmental differences influence microbiomes over small geographical scales. However, very few microbiome studies focus on animals that inhabit the intertidal. In this study, we investigate the microbiome of the intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. We first describe the microbiome of two body tissues: the feeding appendages, or cirri, and the gut. Next, we examine whether there are differences between the microbiome of each body tissue of barnacles collected from the thermally extreme microhabitats of the rocky shores' upper and lower tidal zones. Results Overall, the microbiome of S. balanoides consisted of 18 phyla from 408 genera. Our results showed that although cirri and gut microbiomes shared a portion of their amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), the microbiome of each body tissue was distinct. Over 80% of the ASVs found in the cirri were also found in the gut, and 44% of the ASVs found in the gut were also found in the cirri. Notably, the gut microbiome was not a subset of the cirri microbiome. Additionally, we identified that the cirri microbiome was responsive to microhabitat differences. Conclusion Results from this study indicate that S. balanoides maintains distinct microbiomes in its cirri and gut tissues, and that the gut microbiome is more stable than the cirri microbiome between the extremes of the intertidal.

AB Biotic and abiotic stressors commonly co-occur in plant communities and influence interactions between plants. However, their combined effects on plant interactions have not been widely studied and are still unclear. Here, we assessed the balance of interactions between neighboring plants along a grazing gradient and under two water regimes. We conducted a three-year-field experiment in semi-arid central Argentina with transplants of the dominant palatable grass Piptochaetium napostaense growing in Baccharis ulicina and open microsites across a gradient of grazing pressure. Additionally, we established a water addition treatment along that gradient. We recorded herbivory, size, and fecundity of P. napostaense. During the first two years, P. napostaense was consumed less and was larger below Baccharis than in the open. These differences were greatest under high grazing pressure. Differences in fecundity between microsites were only detected under high and medium grazing pressure in the first two years. In the third year, Baccharis lost their leaves for unclear reasons and provided poor herbivory protection; hence, P. napostaense plants in Baccharis were larger than those in the open only under medium and low grazing pressure, and there were no differences in fecundity between microsites under any grazing condition. Water additions exerted no effect on plant interactions. The balance of interactions changed from positive under heavy grazing to neutral at low and no grazing and water availability did not alter that balance. We conclude that herbivore pressure is an important driver of the balance of plant interactions in semi-arid environments.

AB This study focuses on changes in zooplankton composition and abundance in Lake Nasser during different flood periods before the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD). Field surveys were carried out in August 2016 (flood period), December 2016 (post-flood period), and May 2017 (pre-flood period). Fifteen sampling sites representing five sectors were selected to cover the lake whole area. The results revealed a highly significant difference (p <= 0.016) in the density of all identified zooplankton groups among different flood seasons and lake locations. The zooplankton standing crop during the flood was higher, by a factor of approximately 3.7, than that recorded in post-flood and pre-flood periods. Zooplankton was dominated by medium-sized Copepoda, two cyclopoids (Thermocyclops neglectusandMesocyclops ogunnus) and one calanoid (Thermodiaptomus galebi). The euplanktonic rotiferKeratella cochlearisdominated, during post-flood and pre-flood periods, constituting approximately 83% and 77% of total rotifer densities, respectively.Keratella tropicaoccurred in greatest density during flood made up 52.6% of total rotifers.Diaphanosoma mongolianumwas the main cladoceran during flood and post-flood periods, whereasCeriodaphnia dubiadensities were highest for pre-flood periods. This study found that flood regime affect zooplankton composition and density in Lake Nasser.

AB Recent models suggest that anthropogenic global warming will lead to an increase in the number of major hurricanes, which have strong effects on ecosystems and may modify animal population characteristics. The goal of this study was to assess the body condition of American crocodiles Crocodylus acutus of Cozumel and Banco Chinchorro islands, Mexico, and use it as a tool to better understand short- and long-term effects of hurricanes on crocodilian populations. Changes in body condition (Fulton's K) of 392 crocodiles, captured between 2003 and 2015, were assessed and analyzed in response to a major hurricane through different environmental factors. Differences among populations and size classes, and between sexes, together with seasonal variation, were also evaluated. The body condition of crocodiles was generally good, with better condition for Banco Chinchorro, suggesting that these populations and the ecosystems they inhabit are healthy. Body condition for hatchlings and adults was higher than for other classes, with adults exhibiting the best condition. Body condition of Banco Chinchorro individuals varied seasonally, responding to reproductive events and environmental parameter fluctuations. We also found that C. acutus body condition is sensitive to the passage of tropical cyclones, most likely through their effects on salinity, temperature, and prey availability. Tropical cyclones have a 2-fold effect on populations. In the short-term, crocodile health is negatively affected by disturbance, while the species seems to maintain and improve its body condition over the longer term. An increase in strong tropical cyclone frequency could impede the recovery of populations, while causing a continual decrease in crocodile body condition.

AB The effects of an invasive species on the environment can be altered by anthropogenic activities such as nutrient pollution or the presence of additional invasive species with similar or unique traits. Using experimental mesocosms, we tested the separate and combined effects of three invasive mollusks (zebra mussels, Asian clams, and banded mystery snails) on freshwater environments in nutrient-poor and nutrient-enriched conditions. We predicted that in nutrient-poor conditions, single mollusk species would reduce the abundance of algae and zooplankton, but nutrient enrichment would mitigate these effects. Regardless of nutrient additions, paired bivalve species would reduce phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, increasing periphyton biomass. Bivalves and snails paired together would reduce periphyton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton compared to communities with paired bivalve species. Finally, nutrient enrichment would increase the survival or biomass of paired bivalves and snails. Single, paired, and three co-occurring invasive mollusks did not affect algae or zooplankton abundance. Banded mystery snails reduced nutrient concentrations in high-nutrient conditions more than other invasive species, but the reduced nutrients did not affect algal abundance. Paired invasive species did not affect the survival or biomass of other invasive species. Nutrient enrichment increased the biomass of zebra mussels and mystery snails, but not Asian clams. Additionally, zebra mussel reproduction increased in the high-nutrient treatment when banded mystery snails were present, but not when all three species were together. We conclude that human-induced trophic states might determine the effects that single and multiple invasive species have in freshwater environments.

AB Questions The arid Kalahari is prone to desertification as a result of climate change and/or land use. We analysed the effects of climatic variables and game herbivory on the vegetation composition to answer the question of how different life-form types respond to climate, browsers and grazers as drivers of vegetation change. Location The study was situated in the arid savanna of the South African Kalahari. Methods Vegetation monitoring was conducted on 20 randomly selected permanent plots (100 m(2)) within a biodiversity observatory. For each plot, individuals per species (abundance) were counted annually and grouped into eight life-form types (annual and perennial graminoid and annual and perennial forb, geophyte, dwarf shrub, large shrub and tree). We ran generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) with abundance per life-form type as response variable and a seasonal drought index (Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index [SPEI]), total annual rainfall, year, density of large game and springbok as fixed effects, plot as random effect and year as random slope. Results Seasonal SPEI and density of large game and springbok had the strongest effect on abundance per life-form type. Annual rainfall did not show any effect. The grazing large game had positive effects on the abundance of herbaceous life forms and dwarf shrubs. The predominantly browsing springbok had negative effects on perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs and trees. Directional trends in abundance per life form over time (increase of annual and decrease of perennial graminoids and forbs, increase of large shrubs) and decrease of total annual cover suggest early stages of vegetation degradation and shrub encroachment in response to both herbivory and climate. Conclusions Our study showed that studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of arid systems should include both variance of intra-annual climatic conditions and herbivore density as environmental drivers, related to abundance per life-form/strategy type to reveal their specific responses to the environment.

AB The concept of the piosphere is important in rangeland management, wildlife management, desertification. Piosphere research describes the changes in soil, biota and fauna as a function of distance from water sources utilized by grazing animals. Piosphere research has provided a better understanding of how grazing pressure can affect local environments. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to describe the progress of piosphere knowledge between 1915 and 2018. This is the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of piosphere research, and it provides insights on future challenges, research challenges, and knowledge gaps. Google Scholar was used to identify 875 publications from 68 countries and 10 different languages. Our analyses showedthat research article was the most frequent publication type and piosphere was the most frequent keyword. Australia was first in the number of publications followed by South Africa and USA. Ivan Thrash is the most contributed author with 11 publications. The most frequently cited article is 'Responses of Mediterranean grassland plants to grazing and protection' inThe Journal of Ecology. Herbivores, vegetation, soil, livestock, wildlife, and ecological were the most frequent research areas of piosphere investigations. English was the major and dominant language of piosphere publications. Rapid growth was found in piosphere research since the 1990s, enlivened by advances in statistics, remote sensing, GIS, and programming. We recommend that future research should investigate knowledge gaps such as grazing system relationships to piosphere patterns, economic analysis of watering point development and closure, and the implications of climate change and new piospheres.

AB Since they were listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, Snake River spring-summer Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have been the subject of numerous population viability analyses (PVAs). In all of the previous PVAs that we are aware of, management actions to improve the species' status have focused on increasing survival rates of juveniles and adults. These PVAs did not explicitly treat carry capacity; instead, they assumed that survival rate improvements increased intrinsic productivity, and implicitly assumed that this would also increase carrying capacity. In a novel alternative approach, we instead examined how carrying capacity itself was related to extinction risk. We estimated three alternative multi-population PVAs using maximum likelihood estimation and chose the model with the best fit to the spawner-recruit data from 26 populations in the Snake River Spring/Summer Chinook Salmon evolutionarily significant unit. We then estimated carrying capacity and 24-year extinction probability for each of these populations using alternative quasi-extinction thresholds. We found that carrying capacities estimates were low in several of the populations and that extinction probability increases sharply with decreasing carrying capacity. A sensitivity analysis with fixed carrying capacities and increasing intrinsic productivity illustrated that unless actions increase carrying capacity, little change in extinction risk can occur.

AB Intra-guild interactions related to facilitation and competition can be strong forces structuring ecological communities and have been suggested as particularly prominent for large carnivores. The African lion (Panthera leo) is generally thought to be a dominant predator where it occurs and can be expected to have broad effects on sympatric carnivore communities. We used data from two small game reserves in northern South Africa to relate the presence of African lions to abundance, habitat use, diet, and prey selection of two sympatric large carnivores, brown hyaenas (Parahyaena brunnea) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Our results offered some support for the facilitative effects of lions on brown hyaenas, and competitive effects on leopards. However, differences between populations living without and with lions were restricted to broad diet composition and appear not to have permeated into differences in either prey selection, abundance or habitat use. Therefore, we suggest that the potential effects of lions on the predator-prey interactions of sympatric predators may have been context dependent or absent, and subsequently argue that lions may not necessarily influence the predator-prey dynamics in the landscapes they live in beyond those caused by their own predatory behaviour.

AB The hirola antelope (Beatragus hunteri) is considered to be the most endangered antelope in the world. In the ex situ translocated population at Tsavo East National Park, calf mortality and the critically low population numbers might suggest low genetic diversity and inbreeding depression. Consequently, a genetic study of the wild population is pivotal to gain an understanding of diversity and differentiation within its range before designing future translocation plans to increase the genetic diversity of the ex situ population. For that purpose, we assessed 55 individuals collected across five localities in eastern Kenya, covering its entire natural range. We used the complete mitochondrial DNA control region and microsatellite genotyping to estimate genetic diversity and differentiation across its range. Nuclear genetic diversity was moderate in comparison to other endangered African antelopes, with no signals of inbreeding. However, the mitochondrial data showed low nucleotide diversity, few haplotypes and low haplotypic differentiation. Overall, the inferred low degree of genetic differentiation and population structure suggests a single population of hirola across the natural range. An overall stable population size was inferred over the recent history of the species, although signals of a recent genetic bottleneck were found. Our results show hope for ongoing conservation management programmes and that there is a future for the hirola in Kenya.

AB Woodland encroachment is a global issue linked to diminished ecosystem services, prompting the need for restoration efforts. However, restoration outcomes can be highly variable, making it difficult to interpret the ecological benefits and risks associated with woodland-reduction treatments within semiarid ecosystems. We addressed this uncertainty by assessing the magnitude and direction of vegetation change over a 15-year period at 129 sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) sites following pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) (P-J) reduction. Pretreatment vegetation indicated strong negative relationships between P-J cover and the abundance of understory plants (i.e., perennial grass and sagebrush cover) in most situations and all three components differed significantly among planned treatment types. Thus, to avoid confounding pretreatment vegetation and treatment type, we quantified overall treatment effects and tested whether distinct response patterns would be present among three dominant plant community types that vary in edaphic properties and occur within distinct temperature/precipitation regimes using meta-analysis (effect size = lnRR = ln[posttreatment cover/pretreatment cover]). We also quantified how restoration seedings contributed to overall changes in key understory vegetation components. Meta-analyses indicated that while P-J reduction caused significant positive overall effects on all shrub and herbaceous components (including invasive cheatgrass [Bromus tectorum] and exotic annual forbs), responses were contingent on treatment- and plant community-type combinations. Restoration seedings also had strong positive effects on understory vegetation by augmenting changes in perennial grass and perennial forb components, which similarly varied by plant community type. Collectively, our results identified specific situations where broad-scale efforts to reverse woodland encroachment substantially met short-term management goals of restoring valuable ecosystem services and where P-J reduction disposed certain plant community types to ecological risks, such as increasing the probability of native species displacement and stimulating an annual grass-fire cycle. Resource managers should carefully weigh these benefits and risks and incorporate additional, appropriate treatments and/or conservation measures for the unique preconditions of a given plant community in order to minimize exotic species responses and/or enhance desirable outcomes.

AB Long-proboscid nemestrinid flies are keystone pollinators of dozens of Southern African plants and, consequently, their taxonomic status might have important consequences for insect and plant conservation. We focus on Prosoeca peringueyi, considered to be a single, morphologically variable species, upon which a guild of similar to 28 plants in the winter rainfall region depends for pollination. We quantified morphological variation and established whether it was associated with genetic variation within and among sites. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial COI gene revealed two well-supported clades. One clade contains long-proboscid individuals that conform morphologically to the holotype of P. peringueyi. The sister clade contains individuals that frequently occur sympatrically with P. peringueyi and have shorter proboscides, with additional diagnostic characters that set it apart from P. peringueyi. A haplotype analysis based on nuclear ribosomal 28S DNA sequences of a subset of individuals corroborated these results. Based on our results, we propose the recognition of two species: P. peringueyi and Prosoeca torquata sp. nov., which is described here. Future research is required to quantify the interaction networks of these two fly species and the plant guilds with which they interact, to facilitate conservation in the global biodiversity hotspot where they occur.

AB In contrast to a pure cropping system, integrated crop-livestock systems offer a potential for sustainable intensification of pasture-based savanna systems by maintaining vital ecosystem functions (ESF) while providing stable crop yields in a changing environment. In all variations of the mentioned systems, vegetation and animals interact and influence ESFs in different ways and to different extents. However, to date, there is no comprehensive model available to simulate impacts of large-scale savanna land use change (LUC) on food provision and ESFs. We developed a catalogue of required functional model skills for savanna LUC simulation and analysed existing models against this catalogue by scoring. Based on the model scoring, we discuss challenges and opportunities of different model development pathways. Further steps of model integration and coupling are required to simulate interactions with socio-economic decision-making and LUC effects on wildlife.

AB We analyzed the characteristics of the human-animal conflict coming from the attitudes that local communities have towardCeratophrys ornata, focusing on two threats: aversion and pet trade. Surveys conducted in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay (n= 194) showed a strong aversion to this species (45% of respondents), causing the death of at least 364 individuals. This aversion was strongly linked to symbolism and folklore beliefs, and also influenced by gender and education level. Pet trade interviews (n= 30) showed that 77% of the specimens kept in captivity were wild-caught (approximate to 178 individuals). The killing of specimens based on aversion might have impacts at local level, especially in populations occurring in recent urbanized areas. Our results also revealed that capture of specimens for pet trade is an ongoing process. Due to the context of illegality in which trade occurs, it is highly challenging to determine/predict the extent of impacts.

AB Body condition (BC) has been used extensively to evaluate fitness in animals. In traditional studies of crocodiles, the paradigm of evaluating BC with the Fulton index and interpreting the results with quartiles is predominant. However, the wide variety of indices available provides a diversity of tools with which BC can be interpreted in multiple ways. In this study, three indices based on the function of length and weight were evaluated: the Fulton index (K), relative condition index (Kn), and scaled mass index (SMI). The body condition score (BCS) index was also adapted. This was performed as a clinical evaluation of specific morpho-anatomical points. The Fulton index presented a strong relationship with corporal size that generates poor interpretation, scoring low BC in small individuals and high BC in large individuals. This problem does not occur in Kn, SMI nor BCS. SMI and Kn are difficult to interpret, but this is normally conducted by quartiles, generating ambiguous and potentially misleading explanations. The use of BCS avoids these complications because its direct and simple evaluation acts to convert the abstract numbers of the indices to a clinical reality.

AB Background: Linaceae has been recognized worldwide by its agricultural member, the flax; however, there are more than 200 little-explored species that represent an agroeconomic resource with great potential.
   Questions: What is the taxonomic richness and distribution of Linaceae in Mexico? What is the ecological and cultural environment in which it develops?
   Studied species: Linaceae
   Study site/dates: Mexico, 1932-2019
   Methods: A database was generated from the review in herbaria, digital media, and literature. With the information collected, as well as the use and design of maps, the richness, distribution, and endemism patterns were evaluated, as well as the ecological and cultural environment of the species.
   Results: Linaceae is represented in Mexico by 27 native species, 13 of them endemic. The states with the most species were Nuevo Le6n (14), Tamaulipas (13), Coahuila, and Puebla (12). The species mainly develop in pine and oaks forests, soils lithosols and feozem, temperate climates and altitudes above 1,000 m. Xerophilic scrub and temperate forest biomes, along with the Sierra Madre Oriental province, recorded the greatest richness. 18 % of the species register uses and more than 50 % are distributed in regions with Nahuatl and Otomi languages.
   Conclusions: Mexico has 10.4 % of the total richness of Linaceae, several vulnerable species, which together with clear nomenclature mistakes, make evident the need to generate taxonomic and conservation works in the group. The current and potential use of the species reveals its importance as a valuable plant resource.

AB The increasing number of taxa being translocated across the globe is leading to many non-native species encountering indigenous taxa as well as other non-native species. Environmental heterogeneity may strongly influence the spatial distribution, habitat use and refuge availability for these taxa. Using a series of 24-h mesocosm experiments we examined the predator-prey interactions between an invasive crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and four amphipod taxa, one indigenous (Gammarus pulex) and three non-native species (Crangonyx pseudogracilis, Dikerogammarus villosusandGammarus tigrinus) to Great Britain.The potential mediating effect of physical habitat on predator-prey interactions was examined via the use of different substrate particle sizes; cobbles, gravels and, sand. Survivorship of amphipods in response to crayfish predation varied significantly with the highest rates recorded for the non-native speciesD. villosus, followed byG. tigrinus, andC. pseudogracilis, with the lowest survivorship recorded for the indigenous speciesG. pulexfor all substrates except cobble. However, total biomass consumption of the indigenousG. pulexand the non-nativeD. villosusbyP. leniusculuswere similar suggesting that crayfish may have been satiated by largerD. villosusindividuals. Substrate size had a significant influence on the predation success ofP. leniusculus,with larger substrate clasts typically resulting in increased survivorship rates for all species exceptC. pseudogracilis,which displayed lower predation rates for sand substrates. The findings of this study highlight the risks that naive indigenous taxa may face from new invasive species and the importance of characterising physical habitat (complexity and refugia potential) when considering the potential ecological effects of invaders on predation success.

AB Biological invasions can greatly alter ecological communities, affecting not only the diversity and abundance but also composition of invaded assemblages. This is because invaders' impacts are mediated by characteristics of resident species: some may be highly sensitive to invader impacts while others are unaffected or even facilitated. In some cases, this can result in invasive species promoting further invasions; in particular, herbivory by introduced animals has been shown to disproportionately harm native plants, which can indirectly benefit non-native plants. Here, we investigated whether such patterns emerged through the effects of an invasive fish species on lake plant communities.
   Specifically, we tested whether invasion of Minnesota (U.S.A.) lakes by Cyprinus carpio (common carp), an omnivorous, benthivorous fish known to reduce abundance and richness of aquatic plants, differentially affected native versus non-native plant species. We applied statistical models to a large, long-term monitoring dataset (206 macrophyte taxa recorded in 913 lakes over a 20-year time period) to test whether carp altered community composition, to identify which macrophyte species were most sensitive to carp and determine whether species characteristics predicted carp sensitivity, and to characterise consequences of carp invasion on lake-level vegetation attributes.
   We found that carp exerted strong selective pressure on community composition. Native macrophytes, those with a more aquatic growth form, and those considered less tolerant of disturbance (i.e. higher coefficients of conservatism) were more sensitive to carp. Conversely, no introduced macrophytes exhibited sensitivity to carp and all had higher probabilities of occurrence as carp abundance increased. The net effect of carp invasion was a shift toward less species-rich plant communities characterised by more non-native and disturbance-tolerant species.
   These results have several implications for conservation and management. First, they reinforce the need to prevent further spread of carp outside of their native range. Where carp have already established, their control should be incorporated into efforts to restore aquatic vegetation; this may be an essential step for recovering particular plant species of high conservation importance. Furthermore, reducing carp abundance could have ancillary benefits of reducing dominance by invasive plant species. Lastly, where carp cannot be eliminated, managers should target native macrophytes that are relatively tolerant of carp in shoreline plantings and other revegetation efforts.

AB Surface water availability in drylands has changed with the introduction of artificial water points. Despite known ecological impacts, detailed mapping of this change has not occurred in most drylands. We aimed to quantify the extent and distribution of changes in water availability. We tested whether water availability increased more in pastorally productive areas than less fertile areas, and whether remaining water remote areas are restricted to low productivity landscapes. Our new spatially-explicit method mapped access to water at fine spatial scale, weighting locations by their distance to water and the permanence of those water sources. We demonstrated our method in a study area of over 700,000 km(2) in Queensland, Australia, with our mapping showing large changes in water availability since pastoral development. Less than 5% of the study area is now more than 10 km from water, compared with almost 60% previously. Few refuges for grazing-vulnerable communities remain. Even low fertility landscapes showed marked increases in water availability. This has conservation implications for managing production landscapes. Our approach can be applied in any dryland landscapes that have experienced changes in water availability, and can help guide actions such as removing artificial water points to recreate ecological refuges.

AB Invasive non-native species (INNS) with marine or brackish origins have become increasingly common occupying freshwater habitats. The transition of INNS from marine or brackish water into physiologically stressful freshwater environments may be facilitated by compensatory growth and elevated feeding rates. In this study, we investigate the capacity of the Gulf wedge clam (Rangia cuneata), a brackish NNS that is spreading quickly across European waterways, to survive in freshwater conditions and consider its resultant impacts as an ecosystem engineer. To investigate the performance of R. cuneata under freshwater conditions, we compared the population structure, the physiological condition, and the growth of R. cuneata collected from its distributional limits in Great Britain. Feeding rate of R. cuneata was quantified by conducting a reciprocal transfer experiment with a two-way factorial design on individuals obtained from the freshwater and saline extremes. R. cuneata density was almost 10-fold higher at its most saline distributional limit (213 individual m(-2), 3.1 parts per thousand) compared to its most freshwater limit (22 individuals m(-2), 1.2 parts per thousand). The impaired physiological condition (18.7% lower relative soft tissue mass and 26.4% lower shell mass) and the lack of juvenile individuals also suggests that the R. cuneata inhabiting the freshwater extreme may not be able to maintain a persistent population over the long term. Although R. cuneata at its freshwater extreme were under stress, the per capita impacts caused by these individuals were not weakened at the suboptimal conditions, evidenced by their elevated growth and over four times as high relative clearance rate (0.28 L-1 g(-1) h(-1)) compared to those from the saline limit (0.06 L-1 g(-1) h(-1)). This study demonstrates that under suboptimal conditions, the physiological responses of INNS may result in elevated per capita effects which may lead to unexpected or under-estimated impacts on recipient ecosystems.

AB A field experiment was conducted to investigate the combined application effects of fly ash (FA) (0, 5%, 10%, and 15% (w/w) soil) and polyacrylamide (PAM) (0, 0.006% and 0.012% (w/w) soil) on the edge of Hobq Desert in Inner Mongolia, China from May 2016 to October 2018. Seven different ratios of FA and PAM were selected as evaluation objects, a total of 14 soil property indices and 9 Artemisia ordosica growth indices were selected as evaluation indicators, and the entropy weight method was employed to evaluate the soil physicochemical properties and vegetation growth performances under FA and PAM amendments. The results showed that the F15P1 (15% FA + 0.006% PAM) and F5P1 (5% FA + 0.006% PAM) were the effective treatments for soil improvement and Artemisia ordosica growth respectively. Considering the soil properties and Artemisia ordosica growth in 2016-2018 synthetically, the highest score was observed in the F5P1, followed by the F5P2 (5% FA + 0.012% PAM) and F10P1 (10% FA + 0.006% PAM) treatments. The optimal amounts for FA and PAM should be recommended as 5% and 0.006%, respectively.

AB In fenced protected areas with limited opportunities to disperse, resources and constraints vary in space and time, affecting herbivore behaviour. The distribution, availability and quality of resources, burnt areas, and potential inter-specific competition all play a role in sustaining populations of large sympatric African herbivores. We investigated the role of resources, constraints and interspecific relationships on habitat use by three ruminants - black and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou, C. taurinus) and red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), and a non-ruminant, plains zebra (Equus quagga), across seasons and in different landscape types in a South African reserve. Black wildebeest, blue wildebeest and red hartebeest preferred the open grassland landscape, with homogeneous vegetation, while zebra favoured the wooded grassland landscape, with more heterogeneous vegetation. Burnt areas and vegetation greenness were important for all species, while elevation represented a constraint for black wildebeest only. The presence/absence of other species was important in shaping landscape use for black and blue wildebeest, and this suggests the possibility of competition. Our findings confirm the importance of heterogeneity and, in particular, the important role of a planned burning regime in maintaining such heterogeneity to sustain multi-species herbivore assemblages in small fenced nature reserves, where competition might arise between species using similar resources.

AB The remarkable diversity of antlions in the Afrotropical region is counterbalanced by the scarce knowledge of their biology and ecology. In particular, their larval stages are largely unknown and the morphology of African pit-building species was never investigated in detail. The larvae of three pit-building species attaining a wide distribution across the whole continent, namely Myrmeleon caliginosus, M. obscurus and M. quinquemaculatus are described, illustrated and compared with congeners for the first time. Moreover, M. caliginosus is reported for the first time from Namibia, notably extending the known range of this antlion, with implications on the taxonomy and the identification of African Myrmeleon species. The larvae of these three species highlight the overall conservative morphology across the whole genus, differing in relatively minor characters such as size, proportions, pattern and chaetotaxy.

AB Aims
   Different plant functional groups display diverging responses to the same environmental gradients. Here, we assess the effects of environmental and spatial predictors on species turnover of three functional groups of Brazilian savannas (Cerrado) plants-trees, palms and lianas-across the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazon biomes in central Brazil.
   Methods
   We used edaphic, climatic and plant composition data from nine one-hectare plots to assess the effects of the environment and space on species turnover using a Redundancy Analysis and Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM), associated with variance partitioning.
   Important Findings
   We recorded 167 tree species, 5 palms and 4 liana species. Environmental variation was most important in explaining species turnover, relative to geographic distance, but the best predictors differed between functional groups: geographic distance and silt for lianas; silt for palms; geographic distance, temperature and elevation for trees. Geographic distances alone exerted little influence over species turnover for the three functional groups. The pure environmental variation explained most of the liana and palm turnover, while tree turnover was largely explained by the shared spatial and environmental contribution. The effects of geographic distance upon species turnover leveled off at about 300 km for trees, and 200 km for lianas, whereas they were unimportant for palm species turnover. Our results indicate that environmental factors that determine floristic composition and species turnover differ substantially between plant functional groups in savannas. Therefore, we recommend that studies that aim to investigate the role of environmental conditions in determining plant species turnover should examine plant functional groups separately.

AB The magnitude and direction of an invasive species' impact may be determined by its co-existence and interaction with other species. In Argentina, wild boar, red deer, and fallow deer are introduced mammals that have important negative impacts on ecosystems. In Patagonia, nonnative Pinaceae removal programs have been promoted since the 1980s to control exotic conifers and restore native vegetation. The consequences of removing exotic trees without continued management intervention may be unexpected due novel interactions between nonnative species. We evaluate habitat use of introduced ungulates, interactions with native and exotic plants, and their implications for restoration objectives in areas where pines have been removed. Exotic plant species richness and abundance was greater in clear-cuts than native forest or pine plantations. In contrast, richness and abundance of native plants was highest in native forests. Clear-cuts had the highest plant species diversity, primarily driven by high numbers of exotics, relative to native forests. Boar and deer were recorded in clear-cuts, native forests, and pine plantations, but deer were more frequently observed in clear-cuts. Removal of pines created a suitable habitat for deer. The herbivory pressure of deer, coupled with the presence and abundance of invasive plants, can prevent or hinder the establishment and development of native shrubs and trees that are required for the structure and function of the native ecosystem. Although the conditions in clear-cuts present complex challenges for natural regeneration, these sites could be an excellent opportunity for active restoration strategies, by excluding ungulates and controlling exotic plants to promote native species recovery.

AB The Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area Programme promotes landscape-level connectivity between clusters of wildlife management areas in five neighbouring countries. However, declining regional biodiversity can undermine efforts to maintain, expand and link wildlife populations. Narratives promoting species connectivity should thus be founded on studies of system and state changes in key resources. By integrating and augmenting multiple data sources throughout eight wildlife management areas, covering 1.7 million ha, we report changes during 1978-2015 in the occurrence and distribution of 31 mammal species throughout a landscape linking the Greater Kafue System to adjacent wildlife management areas in Namibia and Botswana. Results indicate species diversity is largely unchanged in Kafue National Park and Mulobezi and Sichifulo Game Management Areas. However, 100% of large carnivore and 64% of prey diversity have been lost in the Simalaha areas, and there is no evidence of migrational behaviour or species recolonization from adjacent wildlife areas. Although temporal sampling scales influence the definition of species occupancy and distribution, and data cannot elucidate population size or trends, our findings indicate an emerging connectivity bottleneck within Simalaha. Evidence suggests that at current disturbance levels the Greater Kafue System, Zambia's majority component in the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, is becoming increasingly isolated at the trophic scale of large mammals. Further investigations of the site-specific, interacting drivers influencing wildlife distribution and occurrence are required to inform appropriate conservation interventions for wildlife recovery in key areas identified to promote transboundary connectivity in the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.

AB In the face of dramatic climate change and human pressure acting on remaining forest areas across tropical, temperate and boreal biomes, there has emerged a coordinated effort to identify and protect forests that are currently considered "intact". These forests are hypothesized to be more resilient to future abiotic perturbations than fragmented or degraded forests, and therefore, will provide more reliable carbon storage and/or biodiversity services into an uncertain future. Research in the fields of contemporary and paleoecology can offer valuable insights to enhance our ability to assess resilience of forests and whether these would be comparable across forest biomes. Contemporary ecological monitoring has been able to capture processes acting over the short-to-medium term, while paleoecologicalmethods allow us to derive insights of the long-term processes affecting forest dynamics. Recent efforts to both identify intact forests, based on area definitions, and assess vegetation climate sensitivity globally have relied on satellite imagery analysis for the time period 2000-2013. In this paper, we compare these published datasets and do find that on average intact forests in boreal and tropical biomes are less sensitive to temperature and water availability, respectively; however, the patterns are less clear within biomes (e.g., across continents). By taking a longer perspective, through paleoecology, we present several studies that show a range of forest responses to past climatic and human disturbance, suggesting that short-term trends may not be reliable predictors of long-term resilience. We highlight that few contemporary and paleoecology studies have considered forest area when assessing resilience and those that have did find that smaller forest areas exhibited greater dynamismin species composition, which could be a proxy for declining resilience. Climatic conditions in the Anthropocene will be pushing forest systems across biomes into novel climates very rapidly and with current knowledge it is difficult to predict how forests will react in the immediate term, which is the most relevant timeframe for global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

AB Nonnative conifers are widespread in the southern hemisphere, where their use as plantation species has led to adverse ecosystem impacts sometimes intensified by invasion. Mechanical removal is a common strategy used to reduce or eliminate the negative impacts of nonnative conifers, and encourage native regeneration. However, a variety of factors may preclude active ecological restoration following removal. As a result, passive restoration - unassisted natural vegetation regeneration - is common following conifer removal. We asked, 'what is the response of understorey cover to removal of nonnative conifer stands followed by passive restoration?' We sampled understorey cover in three site types: two- to ten-year-old clearcuts, native forest and current plantations. We then grouped understorey species by origin (native/nonnative) and growth form, and compared proportion and per cent cover of these groups as well as of bare ground and litter between the three site types. For clearcuts, we also analysed the effect of time since clearcut on the studied variables. We found that clearcuts had a significantly higher average proportion of nonnative understorey vegetation cover than native forest sites, where nonnative vegetation was nearly absent. The understorey of clearcut sites also averaged more overall vegetation cover and more nonnative vegetation cover (in particular nonnative shrubs and herbaceous species) than either plantation or native forest sites. Notably, 99% of nonnative shrub cover in clearcuts was the invasive nonnative species Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius). After ten years of passive recovery since clearcutting, the proportion of understorey vegetation cover that is native has not increased and remains far below the proportion observed in native forest sites. Reduced natural regeneration capacity of the native ecosystem, presence of invasive species in the surrounding landscape and land-use legacies from plantation forestry may inhibit native vegetation recovery and benefit opportunistic invasives, limiting the effectiveness of passive restoration in this context. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB Overexploitation to meet commercial demands has threatened the existence of many species. In theory, one can adopt a portfolio of policies and measures from both the supply (i.e., encourage cultivation while punishing poaching) and demand (i.e., education of consumers) sides to achieve sustainable use. Here we examine the effects of governmental policies and measures towards the utilization of Aquilaria sinensis, a threatened species with high cultural and economic values. We found that, despite national protected status and a suite of government initiatives and granted projects to implement cultivation of the species, poaching persisted and even intensified. From the consumer side, current cultural education related to the species was not coupled with equally strong conservation education, which might have inadvertently reinforced the notion that wild-sourced materials are better, and facilitated a luxury goods-like market for wild products. It appeared that the current government portfolio of initiatives was highly skewed towards utilization, and therefore not effective for promoting the long term ecological persistence of the species. This finding is likely not unique to A. sinensis, nor limited to China. A more balanced portfolio of government initiatives to include stronger and more direct conservation measures towards highly exploited species is needed to achieve sustainable use of this species and related species.

AB This article reviews the literature on the conservation and livelihood impacts of recent policy and institutional reforms concerning the management of common pool natural resources in sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence suggests that the specific institutional and natural resource context is critical to the success or failure of reforms. We also identify several methodological and data deficiencies in the literature that pose significant challenges for the design of effective and sustainable policies in the future. We propose several priorities for future research, including improving the characterization of the nature, extent, and purpose of policies; controlling for confounding effects and selection bias in research design; developing standardized and conceptually sound impact measures that are aligned with the goals of policy reforms; adopting ecosystems approaches that model complex coupled socioecological systems; broadening cost and benefit measures to include the regulation of ecosystem services of significant local, regional, and global value; and identifying long-term economic incentives and benefit-sharing arrangements among stakeholders, particularly given the increasing competition from alternative land use options. Finally, we find that the literature is dominated by contributions from the natural sciences, suggesting an opportunity to increase the role of environmental economics and policy research.

AB Successional tree species often form soil seedbanks, suggesting that extended seed dormancy may also facilitate regeneration in normative species. We examined seed dormancy in Ailanthus altissima, which is currently spreading into long-established forests of Europe and eastern North America. Ailanthus seeds were sewn into replicated nylon mesh bags and buried in 10 second-growth stands in southeast Ohio, USA. North- and south-facing slopes were included as a coarse-grained test for environmental control. Bags were recovered at 2-mo intervals and seeds were tested for viability and germination. Fifty percent of Ailanthus seeds survived the full length of the study (24 mo) after an initial phase of partial germination (51-79% of viable seeds). Remaining seeds returned to a state of induced dormancy, allowing a second flush of germination (3-28%) after 18 mo. After the first 5 mo no further decline in seed number was observed, suggesting persistence in the soil well beyond the 2-yr length of this study. No slope-aspect effect was observed. Long-term seed dormancy potentially facilitates Ailanthus invasion by buffering against extended canopy closure or allowing passive dispersal with movement of soil. Complete eradication of a population will depend on elimination of the soil seed bank, which may require many years. Management should avoid creating canopy openings near existing populations with the goal of suppressing sexual reproduction and seedling establishment.

AB Urban grasslands often exist as fragmented patches with varying threat levels. These patches are generally inappropriately managed due to limited data on their responses to disturbance and seed bank regenerative potential. This study compared seed banks between non-naturally disturbed and undisturbed patches of South African subtropical grasslands in an urban environment. Standing vegetation was characterised via year-round quadrat and monthly transect sampling. The seed banks were sampled after the two main dispersal periods and assessed for species composition and density. The seed bank species (24) represented a subset (9%) of the standing vegetation, with forbs being the most speciose life form and grasses the most abundant. Disturbance had a moderate impact on seed bank density but significantly affected species composition and ordering. Clustering and ordination analyses separated seed banks based on disturbance history. However, seed banks in disturbed patches maintained the general character of the grassland type. Diagnostic, rare and threatened taxa were absent from seed banks, irrespective of disturbance history. Consequently, restoration will possibly require seed enrichment and species reintroduction rather than exploitation of natural seed banks. Identifying disturbance-sensitive species through seed bank surveys can inform grassland conservation and restoration strategies.

Nitrogen uptake by A. mearnsii may also be influenced by water availability, potentially affecting riparian-specific performance and impact estimations. We expected to find functional differences between the invasive legume and the two co-occurring but non-leguminous native species Brabejum stellatifolium and Metrosideros angustifolia. We also wanted to examine whether in-situ water availability affected N source or uptake in the invasive species. We found A. meurnsii was indeed functioning differently from non-N-fixing native species, and had considerably higher foliar %N. Interestingly, N-15 abundance and uptake were associated with site hydrology, meaning water availability should be scrutinised when assuming N-fixing in A. mearnsii using delta N-15. Nonetheless, higher water availability to A. mearnsii in fynbos riparian ecosystems did increase foliar N uptake. This has implications for prioritizing clearing of sites with increased nutrient deposition, such as dense stands in relatively moist riparian zones.

AB The goal of this work was to infer the spatio-temporal patterns of bottom circulation of San Jose Gulf (SJG), Patagonia, Argentina. The SJG is mainly affected by tidal circulation and presents two hydrographic domains. The Western Hydrographic Domain (WHD) presents vertically mixed waters year-round contrary to the seasonal stratified Eastern Hydrographic Domain (EHD), resulting in the formation of a thermal front between domains. Samples of sediments were collected in spring 2016 and summer 2017 at several locations to analyze the grain-size composition by means of laser diffractometry. A conceptual model of bottom hydrodynamics was inferred based on sediment's grain-size trends. Asymmetric dominant tidal currents affect bottom sediment distribution. A general northward sediment transport is dominant at the WHD, while at the EHD there is a seasonal shift in the transport direction. There, a net northward transport with a counterclockwise gyre dominates bottom hydrodynamics at the end of the thermal front formation, conditioned by residual currents. In contrast, a net southward circulation likely driven by strong westerly winds throughout autumn and winter prevails at the beginning of the water column stratification. The inferred sediment transport suggests a net loss of material that has to be recovered by tidal currents entering through the mouth and coastal sources as runoff, mudslides, and/or aeolian dust.

AB Congruence between plant and insect diversity is considered possibly useful in conservation planning, as the better known plants could be surrogates for the lesser known insects. There has been little quantification of congruence across space, especially in biodiversity rich areas. We compare here species richness, and turnover relationships between plants and flower-visiting insects across space (0.5-80 km) in natural areas of a biodiversity hotspot, the Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. A total of 22,352 anthophile individuals in 198 species and 348 plant species were sampled. A comparison between the plants and anthophiles suggest significant concordance between the two assemblages. However, turnover was weaker in plants than in anthophiles. Plant turnover decreased with greater geographical distance between plot pairs. In contrast, insect turnover remained high with increasing geographical distance between plot pairs. These findings suggest that while patterns of plant diversity and distribution shape flower-visiting insect assemblages, they are not reliable surrogates. The conservation significance of these results is that specialist mutualisms are at greatest risk, and that set-asides on farms would help improve the functional connectivity leading to the maintenance of the full range of mutualisms.

AB Littorina littorea (periwinkles) have been harvested by hand picking from the shore since prehistoric times. Harvests are generally unregulated, catches are not linked to particular shores and fisheries statistics are considered to be unreliable. The absence of key data has made it difficult to develop harvesting recommendations. Surveys around Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland were used to investigate the size structure and relationships among densities in different size classes. Three size classes were identified in surveyed L. littorea, with mean shell lengths of 0.81, 1.56 and 2.48 cm. Assuming that the age classes represent year classes, data across different shores suggested that the ratio between densities in successive year classes was not constant. Proportionally fewer individuals were found in the larger, older, size class as the density of the smaller size class on a shore increased. This density-dependent relationship was modelled with a Ricker curve for the year 1 to year 2 and the year 2 to year 3 transitions. The predicted transition rates from Ricker curves were used in a size-structured model to describe L. littorea dynamics. An emergent property of the size-structured model is a decline in mean shell length with overall density of a population. This prediction was supported by the survey data from Strangford Lough and by an independent survey of Irish shores. The size-structured model predicts potential harvests of individuals above 2.06 cm as a function of recruitment rate. Maximum harvest was predicted for a density of 5 year 1 individuals m(-2), leading to 13.8 year 3 individuals m(-2) or an estimated annual harvest weight of 67 g m(-2). Modelled estimates of production provide a means to value shores and develop harvest predictions for management purposes.

AB Diversity and comparative analysis of the microbiota composition of the digestive system of Lake Baikal endemic gastropods Benedictia baicalensis (Caenogastropoda) and of the bottom sediments from their habitat were studied. Strains belonging to 11 genera of heterotrophic bacteria (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Micrococcus) were isolated from the stomach and gut content. Molecular genetic analysis of total DNA from the digestive tract revealed the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the genera Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Mesorhizobium, Deefgea, and of the phylum Tenericutes. Most isolates were found to utilize various organic substances, including those of animal origin, which was probably due to the pantophagy of these mollusks. The cultured bacterial community of B.baicalensis digestive system was shown to be formed by gram-negative bacteria (95-97% strains), although in the bottom sediments 51% of the isolates were gram-positive coccoid and spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria. Low frequency of occurrence or complete absence of gram-positive bacteria in the mollusk intestine compared to the bottom sediments (fivefold or more) may indicate their use as a nutrient substrate.

AB Biological invasions have the potential to alter ecosystem processes profoundly, but invaders are rarely found alone. Interactions between different invasive alien species, and their cumulative impact on ecosystem functioning, have led to hypotheses of invasion meltdown whereby effects become additive leading to further ecosystem stress. Invasive riparian plants (e.g., Rhododendron ponticum) deposit leaf litter in freshwaters, which may be unconsumed by indigenous species, potentially affecting habitat heterogeneity and flow of energy to the food web. However, invasive alien decapod crustaceans are effective consumers of leaf litter, and it was hypothesized that they would also consume inputs of invasive riparian leaf litter. This study shows that invasive alien signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) effectively break down different types of leaf litter, including invasive alien R. ponticum, at higher rates than indigenous white-clawed crayfish. Secondary products were more varied, with more fine particulate organic matter generated for the less palatable alien leaf litter species. Leaf species caused different changes in body mass of decapods but effects were heterogeneous by leaf and decapod: P. leniusculus showed lower mass loss when consuming R. ponticum while E. sinensis lost mass when consuming A. pseudoplatanus. Impacts of riparian invasions on detritus accumulation in freshwaters are thus potentially buffered by invasive alien decapods, illustrating a need for a more detailed consideration of both positive and negative interspecific feedbacks during biological invasions.

AB The extinction of a single species from a local community may carry little cost in terms of species diversity, yet its loss eliminates its biotic and abiotic interactions. We describe such a scenario in the Arava desert, where different cultural and law enforcement practices exclude Dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas (Linnaeus, 1758)) from the Jordanian side of the border while protecting their populations on the Israeli side. We found that gazelles break the soil crust, formed in desert systems after annual flooding, thereby creating patches of loose and cooler sand that are used by pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae). When we artificially broke the soil crust on both sides of the border, we found a significant increase in antlion density in these patches, but only on the Israeli side. On the Jordanian side, where no gazelles have been observed since the early 1980s, no antlions colonized either control or manipulated plots. Additional choice/no-choice feeding experiments, in which we offered antlions to lizards and birds, revealed that the effect of humans on gazelles cascades farther, as antlions serve as a palatable food source for both groups. Thus, the human-mediated loss of nontrophic interactions between gazelles and antlions cascades to the loss of trophic interactions between antlions and their predators.

AB Predator populations are often affected by the abundance of their prey, but pronounced effects on predatory fish have mainly been demonstrated in ecosystems where a key predator depends largely on one key prey species. The North Sea food web has a comparatively high level of complexity with a high diversity of forage fish, and hence strong effects are less likely to occur. However, in the early 2000s within large parts of the North Sea, several forage fish stocks simultaneously suffered from successive years of recruitment failure together with decreasing stock abundances. Whiting Merlangius merlangus is a major fish predator in the North Sea ecosystem and is known to be almost exclusively piscivorous. We hypothesised that shortages in forage fish should lead to negative effects on growth or condition of a predator that relies on a few dominant prey fish species. In our study, we combined 6 different North Sea data sets on abundance of forage fish and length-at-age, condition and stomach contents of M. merlangus to analyse contrasting periods with high and low forage fish availability. We found a simultaneous decrease in forage fish availability and M. merlangus length-at-age in the period from 2000-2007 and a subsequent parallel increase in prey abundance and length-at-age after 2007. In the period of low forage fish availability, mean stomach content mass was on average 60% less than in the reference periods. Additionally, a bioenergetics calculation revealed that even smaller differences in the stomach contents than those observed would have been sufficient to explain the observed differences in length-at-age. Our findings emphasize the need to incorporate predator-prey interactions in assessment models and management strategies.

AB Understanding the benefits of biodiversity conservation is essential for developing policies that can enhance the environment and hence the well-being of humans as well. We formulate a consumer-resources model for a terrestrial ecosystem that incorporates resource diversity in the form of multiple species of resources (for example trees, grasses or both) and the consumers of those resources. This model is used to explore a potential benefit of maintaining ecosystem biodiversity, namely reducing the spread of infectious diseases. The important mathematical features of the model are derived, analysed and used to investigate our hypothesis that increasing species diversity in the resources can reduce diseases in those resources. The results of the analyses and numerical simulations suggest that indeed increasing resource diversity can lead to a decrease in infectious diseases. Of more interest, we show how increased diversity can result in eradication of disease in cases where disease persistence would normally be predicted.

AB Rooting differentiation between established trees and grasses has been well documented in savannas, but it remains unclear to what extent tree-grass rooting differences affect competition between newly established seedlings and grasses. To examine this question, a greenhouse experiment was conducted at the University of Missouri, USA. Twenty 3-mo-old seedlings each of two African savanna tree species (Acacia nigrescens and Colophospermum mopane) were grown for 8 mo with two crossed factors: grass competition and irrigation depth. Strong negative effects of grass competition on final seedling biomass and leaf photosynthetic and stomatal conductance occurred in both tree species, but no effects of irrigation depth were detected. There was a clear tree species by grass competition interaction, suggesting interspecific variation in competitive response. The results emphasize the importance of below-ground competition with grasses for physiological and morphological responses of tree seedlings, while minimizing the importance of tree-grass rooting depth differences as a factor in modulating the competitive response of trees to grasses at the seedling stage.

AB Given the significance of conserving and improving lands management with a high conservation value, chosen for conserving and recovering plant and animal habitats as protected areas on a large scale, this study was conducted with the aim of identifying threat and pressure factors of protected areas in Khuzestan Province, Iran. In this study at 2015, using Delphi method, the threat and pressure factors of protected areas in Khuzestan Province were identified. Next, using RAPPAM methodology presented by WWF organization for managerial effectiveness of protected areas, the greatest threat and pressure factors of regions were investigated by individual regions and collectively for all of the regions. The results of this study suggest that five major factors of collective threat and pressure across all protected areas in Khuzestan Province in Iran are overgrazing (405.07), dam building (374.25), shortage of workforce and equipment (338.22), conversion of land use (283.23), cutting of trees (243.72). In contrast, the lowest threat and pressure factor was the effects caused by immigration of nomads (43.88). Among the protected areas studied in Khuzestan Province, the greatest collective threat and pressure factor is related to Dez protected area (674.41), while the lowest threat and pressure factor is related to Koraii protected area (342.51). Thereafter, attempts have been made to present some suggestions to solve or mitigate the effects of these factors given the pressure and threat factors present in the protected areas of Khuzestan Province. Among these solutions can one mention offering the license of grazing to local communities in the area in a periodical fashion, consideration of incentive measures for the area's staff in order to enhance motivation and aid in conservation of the area, holding training courses for the staff suited with the new needs of the area, recovery of the boundaries of the protected areas to prevent to transgression to the area and alteration of land use.

AB Cape gannet Morus capensis chicks depend entirely on fish prey and metabolic water for water requirements during development. Water loss through evaporative cooling due to heat stress is substantial. We measured water flux and field metabolic rates (FMR) of Cape gannet chicks and adults to determine if gannets developed water saving strategies. The water economy index (WEI, gkJ(-1)) decreased with chick age according to the model WEI=0.676 - 0.272xlog(10)(t), indicating that water efficiency increased with age. At fledging, the WEI of chicks was at the level expected of adult desert birds. Desert birds maintain a low WEI by also having a low FMR, whereas Cape gannet chicks have FMR comparable to other seabird species' nestling requirements. We propose that maintaining low WEI is adaptive for Cape gannets because (1) chicks need to balance water loss through evaporative cooling, (2) fledglings need to overcome a period of up to a week when they cannot ingest any water and (3) adults spend extended periods in the breeding colony during which water can become a limiting factor. Understanding the physiological mechanism of maintaining low WEI will become increasingly important with future rising temperatures.

AB Invasive alien species (IAS) are a recognised threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services. With increasing tourism and projected 21st century climate changes across the mid- to high-latitudes of the southern hemisphere, subantarctic islands are potentially highly vulnerable to IAS, but suffer from a dearth of baseline monitoring. Here we report tree-ring measurements from a lone exotic Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr) on subantarctic Campbell Island to determine past growth rates and likely future response to climate changes. Though the samples were unable to resolve exactly when the tree was planted, the fast growth rate indicates it is likely to have been later than the reported date of 1901. Since at least 1941, the tree appears to have responded favourably to the relatively warm summers experienced on Campbell Island, resulting in growth more rapid than that observed in natural stands (North American Pacific Coast). Although trees of similar age arc normally mature and produce cones, none have so far been observed on Campbell Island - possibly the result of the fast growth causing an extended 'juvenile' or pre-reproductive phase - preventing seeding across the island. Importantly, relatively dry periods are needed for cones to open and disperse seeds, conditions not recorded in the instrumental record. Examination of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) outputs show increasing rainfall across the region during the 21st century under a range of emission scenarios, suggesting that even when mature, the Sitka spruce poses a limited threat to the long-term ecology of Campbell Island.

AB Most species of Ischnochiton are habitat specialists and are almost always found underneath unstable marine hard- substrata such as boulders. The difficulty of experimenting on these chitons without causing disturbance means little is known about their ecology despite their importance as a group that often contributes greatly to coastal species diversity. In the present study we measured among- boulder distributional patterns of Ischnochiton smaragdinus, and used time- lapse photography to quantify movement behaviours within different habitat types ( pebble substrata and rock- platform). In intertidal rock- pools in South Australia, I. smaragdinus were significantly overdispersed among boulders, as most boulders had few individuals but a small proportion harboured large populations. I. smaragdinus individuals emerge from underneath boulders during nocturnal low- tides and move amongst the inter- boulder matrix ( pebbles or rock- platform). Seventy- two percent of chitons in the pebble matrix did not move from one pebble to another within the periods of observation (55-130 min) but a small proportion moved across as many as five pebbles per hour, indicating a capacity for adults to migrate among disconnected habitat patches. Chitons moved faster and movement paths were less tortuous across rock-platform compared to pebble substrata, which included more discontinuities among substratum patches. Overall, we show that patterns of distribution at the boulder-scale, such as the observed overdispersion, must be set largely by active dispersal of adults across the substratum, and that differing substratum-types may affect the degree of adult dispersal for this and possibly other under-boulder chiton species.

AB Large branchiopods face time constraints in reproduction efficiency due to their living in temporary environments. Efficiency on mate locating is especially important for sustaining their populations. Light has been demonstrated as an important factor influencing mating success for anostracans, but detailed information is lacking. Branchinella kugenumaensis tends to aggregate at water surface. We hypothesized that this tendency is related to necessity of light for mating. We observed Branchinella kugenumaensis mating behavior, which contained 6 elements: orientation, station taking, amplexus, intromission, copulation and disengagement. In addition, we compared the first 3 elements of behavioral responses of focal males toward three types of potential mates (receptive females, non-receptive females and other males) in both light and dark conditions. We found that light effects were significant in all 3 behavioral elements, regardless of potential mate types. Therefore, we suggest that male B. kugenumaensis relies on vision to assess potential mates.

AB This study is based largely on 20 years of field and laboratory work, with surveys conducted by the authors and some other researchers. During this period several studies dealing with freshwater large branchiopods (FLB) were carried out, resulting in scientific publications and project reports. The distribution of FLB in Portugal was presented in 2 international scientific meetings, but apart from a first paper by Vianna-Fernandes in 1951 and an update done by ourselves in 1999 concerning the southwest Portugal, no other information has been published. Therefore, this work intends to bring up to date the known distribution of this faunal group in freshwater temporary systems. This is pertinent because of the recent revision of the taxon Triops cancriformis on the basis of genetic analyses. The Portuguese populations were assigned either to the Portuguese endemism T. vicentinus, or to T. baeticus, the more widely spread Iberian species, both belonging to the T. mauritanicus complex. Furthermore, a new species, Tanymastigites lusitanica was found and described in Portugal. More recently, a male free (or, at least, a strongly female-biased) metapopulation of T cancriformis was discovered in a rice field in the central region of Portugal. Here we present an updated status of FLB species of Portuguese temporary lentic systems and their distribution, plotted on a UTM (10 x 10 km) grid. A total of 505 sites (temporary ponds or assemblages of closely located, not individual temporary pools) have been surveyed (455 by us). In 241 of these (47.7%) at least one species of FLB was found on at least one occasion. Of the 505 sites, only 87 are located north of the Tagus River and of these, at least one species was found in only 17 (19.5%). South of the Tagus River (Alentejo and Algarve), 53.6% of the sites were inhabited by at least one species. This list comprises 7 anostracans, 2 spinicaudatans and 4 notostracans, including 3 species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and another 3 to Portugal.

ID MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM; AREAS
AB Use of water by wildlife is not explicitly considered in any part of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). However, wildlife uses water and in some cases this may be in conflict with other water uses (e.g. irrigation). To examine the magnitude of this problem and the conceptual and practical challenges of including wildlife water use in the SEEA, estimates of water use for 31 mammals in Botswana were developed using readily available data on their abundance and coefficients of water use. Three recording options were considered for the physical supply and use tables: (1) water use by wildlife shown in a new column entitled "Wildlife"; (2) shown as a use by industry under "Operation of nature reserves" and; (3) the preferred option, shown as a split between the first two options, reflecting the location of wildlife inside or outside national parks. The key conceptual issue for recording is the delineation of the production boundary, determined in this case by the extent to which wildlife is deemed managed and hence akin to a cultivated resource in the SEEA. Despite some data limitations, wildlife water use in Botswana was significant, with 21 species accounting for 19,345 ML in 2012-13, equivalent to 10% of the previously estimated water consumption in that year. Water account producers now have clear options for including wildlife, providing water planners and wildlife managers with improved information to help balance competing demands for water that may occur at particular times and places.

AB Landscape function is largely determined by landscape structure. Evidence suggests that landscape heterogeneity often benefits generalists over sympatric specialists. The scale at which animals perceive that heterogeneity likely varies across species and could play an important role in determining the species assemblages supported by different landscapes. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of landscape heterogeneity in the structuring of raptor assemblages in mixed-grass prairie. We compared niche breadth and overlap of 14 species in two landscapes that differed in heterogeneity. We used a modified line transect approach and distance sampling to determine approximate locations of raptors and mapped these locations in a GIS. We then compared land cover in buffered areas around detection locations to randomly selected locations at different scales. We calculated Outlying Mean Index to quantify niche breadth and compare among species. Species composition was similar in both landscapes, but niche characteristics differed according to heterogeneity. Raptor assemblages were better predicted by land cover composition in heterogeneous landscapes than by land cover configuration in homogenous landscapes. Outlying Mean Index analysis suggested that six of the 14 species occupied marginal niches and narrower niche breadths in homogeneous landscapes. None of these species demonstrated marginality but occupied broader niche breadths in heterogeneous landscapes. Our study provides evidence that heterogeneity is important in providing conditions necessary to support multiple, sympatric birds of prey in mixed-grass prairie. Species overlapped broadly under heterogeneity but less in landscapes with larger patches of distinct land cover types.

AB The island of Cuba has the greatest diversity of birds in the Caribbean, and at the same time, a large number of endangered species. Illegal trade is one of major threats in Neotropical islands, because birds are captured for domestic and international illegal market. This study was undertaken with the aim to characterize the domestic market, in which captive wild birds are used as pets in the central region of Cuba. For this, a census and random survey to identify, and describe wild bird richness and abundance in 10 localities of urban and rural environments, was undertaken from August to November 2014, and from June to October 2015. Our results detected that at least 24 species and 973 individuals from six orders and 11 families were captive. The best represented order was Passeriformes (13 species), followed by Accipitrifonnes (four species). The best-represented families were Thraupidae (3.3 +/- 0.33) and Cardinalidae (2.6 +/- 0.45). Besides, the localities of Patria (17), Moron (13) and Bolivia (13) in the urban area had the highest richness. The richness of residents (5.80 +/- 0.68) was higher than the endemics (1.70 +/- 0.30) and migrants (2.70 +/- 0.52), while the richness of endemics (2.5 +/- 0.29) and residents (7.75 +/- 0.63) was higher in urban areas. There were more captive species with Least Concern category (6.20 +/- 1.02), but the Endangered category predominated in rural areas (12.5 %). The most common species were Passerina cyanea, Melopyrrha nigra, Tiaris olivaceus and Passerina ciris. A total of 46 % of the species were classified with a tendency to decrease, 33.3 % to increase and 20.8 % to stability. The abundance of species with a tendency to decrease (63.4 +/- 22.13) was higher than those that tend to stability (14.8 +/- 9.9). The actual traffic will lead to species extinction, mainly parrots and raptors, threatening several ecological services. Illegal trade should be addressed as an environmental, economic and social problem. Strategy for controlling this unsustainable trade was proposed.

AB Microphyllous and rosetophyllous desert scrub plant communities dominate large parts of the state of Coahuila, Mexico, yet differences in how livestock grazing impacts these two plant communities are not well documented. In order to address this knowledge gap, we assessed livestock impact on plant species composition and vegetation structure in microphyllous and rosetophyllous desert scrublands in this northwestern Mexican state. We collected plant density, frequency, and cover data from sites with and without livestock grazing pressure that were otherwise similar in plant composition. We quantified intersite differences using the importance value index (IVI) and the Bray-Curtis similarity index. The species with the highest IVI for microphyllous scrubland were lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata); however, in sites with presence of domestic herbivores, desert willow (Chilopsis linearis) and spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida) also showed high values. Plant species with the highest IVIs in rosetophyllous scrublands were lechuguilla, creosote bush, mariola (Parthenium incanum), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) for both land use types. The Bray-Curtis similarity index between microphyllous desert scrub and rosetophyllous desert scrub was 62%. Moreover, microphyllous scrub with and without livestock had 48% similarity, whereas rosetophyllous scrub sites with and without livestock were 65% similar. Results indicate that livestock grazing significantly modifies plant species composition and vegetation structure in both types of the studied desert scrublands.

AB The embryonic metabolisms of the ornithischian dinosaurs Protoceratops andrewsi and Hypacrosaurus stebingeri have been determined and are in the range observed in extant reptiles. The average value of the measured embryonic metabolic rates for P. andrewsi and H. stebingeri are then used to calculate the incubation times for 21 dinosaurs from both Sauischia and Ornithischia using a mass growth model based on conservation of energy. The calculated incubation times vary from about 70 days for Archaeopteryx lithographica to about 180 days for Alamosaurus sanjuanensis. Such long incubation times seem unlikely, particularly for the sauropods and large theropods. Incubation times are also predicted with the assumption that the saurischian dinosaurs had embryonic metabolisms in the range observed in extant birds.

AB Spent drilling muds are the liquid residues of rock drilling operations. Due to a high concentration of suspended solids and potentially detrimental chemical properties, they can negatively affect microorganisms participating in wastewater treatment processes. We evaluated the addition of a potassium-polymer drilling fluid (DF) to activated sludge in laboratory sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) for municipal wastewater treatment. Ciliate assemblage, the most dynamic component of eukaryotes in activated sludge, and which is highly sensitive to changes in the system, was evaluated. The average ciliate abundance dropped by about 51% (SBR 2; 1% DF added) and 33% (SBR 3; 3% DF added) in comparison to the control (SBR 1; wastewater only). A decrease in the total number of ciliate species during the experiment was observed, from 25 to 24 in SBR 2 and from 17 to 13 in SBR 3. Moreover, a drop in the number of dominant (> 100 individuals mL(-1)) ciliate species was observed during the experiment-from eight in the control to five in SBR 2 and four in SBR 3-signaling noticeable changes in the quantitative structure of ciliate species. The species analyzed showed different responses to DF addition. The most sensitive was Aspidisca cicada, which is bacteriovorus. In contrast, two predators, Acineria uncinata and Holophrya discolor, showed no reaction to DF addition. Our results indicate that addition of potassium-polymer DF, in doses of 1 to 3% of the treated wastewater volume, had no toxic effects on ciliates, but qualitative and quantitative changes in their community were observed.

AB Increasing colonization of non-native amphipod species in the River Thames, United Kingdom, has altered aquatic ecology and called existing management practices into question. We studied the distribution patterns of recent non-native (Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1841)), established non-native (Crangonyx pseudogracilis (Bousfield, 1958)), and native amphipod (Gammarus pulex (Linnaeus, 1758)) species, as well as habitat and human influences across 84 sites in the upper Thames catchment. Our findings showed widespread distribution and density of G. pulex relative to D. haemobaphes, suggesting that the full impact of the current spread has yet to be felt since its 2012 introduction. Different habitat utilization patterns are explained through habitat partitioning: both D. haemobaphes and C. pseudogracilis occupied vegetative habitats, not pebble/ gravel habitats where the native G. pulex was most often found. The association between D. haemobaphes and boating presence implies that effective biosecurity would be best focused on boat traffic in the Thames and Cherwell rivers.

AB The existence, or not, of cyclic dynamics is one of the pivotal aspects of ecological populations. This work considers a consumer resource model found in ecology that can describe both cyclic and non-cyclic dynamics depending on parameter conditions. A threshold consumption number C-0 is introduced, similar to the basic reproduction R-0 in epidemiological models. It is shown that consumer survival requires C-0 > 1 and that a Hopf bifurcation occurs at C-0 = C-0*, where C-0 is defined here and is greater than 1. This result is discussed with an example and extensions to other more complicated models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The distribution and endemicity patterns of Gomphales in Mexico are analyzed here for the first time. Richness and corrected endemism were obtained from a dataset of 3,483 records for 97 species, using a cell-grid system of one degree per side. The central region of Mexico (Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Estado de Mexico states), which includes most of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre Oriental biogeographic provinces, had the highest richness values, but Mexican areas in the Pacific Coast (Jalisco and Michoacan states) and southeastern Mexico (Oaxaca and Chiapas states) had the most distinctive composition, as measured by the corrected endemism index. Two main distributional patterns were recovered: a) montane: at elevations above 1000m on coniferous, pine-oak, oak and cloud forests, typified by the presence of species of Ramaria and Clavariadelphus, b) lowlands: at elevations below 1000m mainly in evergreen, rainforest and deciduous tropical forests characterized by the presence of four tropical species of Lentaria, two tropical species of Gomphus endemic to Mexico, and four tropical species of Phaeoclavulina. The eight species of Gomphales endemic to Mexico have very restricted distribution, mostly in non-protected areas, and are not considered under special protection programs. The present contribution delineates general patterns of distribution for the Gomphales, and documents its diversity and endemism in Mexico.

ID AMERICAN ALLIGATORS; POPULATION; PATTERNS; RIVER
AB Populations of the Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius) have not recovered from past exploitation, and current abundances cannot be used for assessing the suitability of habitats they occupy. Growth constitutes an alternative way of assessing habitat quality. Since 1990, more than 9000 captive-reared Orinoco crocodiles have been released into the Venezuelan Llanos. In the present study, the growth rates of 127 recaptured crocodiles from different regions were compared. All individuals from Middle Cojedes and the Aeolian savannahs grew slower than expected by the von Bertalanffy model, whereas individuals from Canos in the Apure floodplains grew faster than expected. These inferences are corroborated with growth rate measurements for crocodiles under four years of age, which were lowest in Middle Cojedes (average of 14.1 cm/year) and highest at Canos (43.3 cm/year). Low growth rates can be explained by habitat deterioration due to human activities, and high growth rates in the Canos support that the lower reaches of whitewater rivers offer favourable conditions for the species. Crocodiles in high quality habitats may reach sexual maturity in six years, whereas more than a decade is required in poor-quality habitats.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OECOPHYLLA-SMARAGDINA; PLANT MUTUALISM; HYMENOPTERA; COMPETITION
AB Asian weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) are arboreal ants that are known to form mutualistic complexes with their host trees. They are eusocial ants that build elaborate nests in the canopy in tropical areas. A colony comprises of multiple nests, usually on multiple trees, and the boundaries of the colony may be difficult to identify. However, they provide the ideal model for studying group living in invertebrates since there are a definite number of nests for a given substrate, the tree. Here, we briefly examine the structure of the nests and the processes involved in the construction and maintenance of these nests. We have described the spatial arrangement of weaver ant nests on trees in two distinct tropical clusters, a few hundred kilometres apart in India. Measurements were made for 13 trees with a total of 71 nests in the two field sites. We have considered a host of biotic and abiotic factors that may be crucial in determining the location of the nesting site by Asian weaver ants. Our results indicate that tree characteristics and architecture followed by leaf features help determine nest location in Asian weaver ants. While environmental factors may not be as influential to nest arrangement, they seem to be important determinants of nest structure. The parameters that may be considered in establishing the nests could be crucial in picking the evolutionary drivers for colonial living in social organisms.

Resilience may be used as an early warning system for significant or irreversible community transition; that is, a community with diminishing or low resilience may be close to catastrophic shift in function or an irreversible collapse. Typically, resilience is quantified using recovery time, which may be difficult or impossible to directly measure in microbial systems. A recent study in the literature showed that under certain conditions, a set of spatial-based metrics termed recovery length, can be correlated to recovery time, and thus may be a reasonable alternative measure of resilience. However, this spatial metric of resilience is limited to use for step-change perturbations. Building upon the concept of recovery length, we propose a more general form of the spatial metric of resilience that can be applied to any shape of perturbation profiles (for example, either sharp or smooth gradients). We termed this new spatial measure "perturbation-adjusted spatial metric of resilience" (PASMORE). We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metric using a mathematical model of a microbial mat.

AB The state of Florida, USA, has more introduced herpetofauna than any other governmental region on Earth. Four species of nonnative crocodilians have been introduced to Florida (all since 1960), one of which is established. Between 2000-2014 we field-collected three nonnative crocodilians in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and one in Hendry County, Florida. We used DNA barcoding and molecular phylogenetics to determine species identification and native range origin. Also, we described diet, movement, and growth for one crocodile. Our molecular analyses illustrated that two of the crocodiles we collected are most closely related to Nile Crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) from South Africa, suggesting this region as a source population. We, thus, documented the first known introduction of C. niloticus in Florida. Two, and possibly three of the introduced crocodiles shared the same haplotype, suggesting they are likely from the same introduction pathway or source. One animal was captured, measured, marked, and released, then recaptured 2 y later allowing us to calculate growth rate (40.5 cm/y) and movement. The most likely route of travel by waterway (i.e., canal) illustrates that this animal traveled at least 29 km from its original capture site. One crocodile escaped from a facility in Hendry County, Florida, and survived in 1,012 ha of semi-wild habitat for three to four years, confirming that this species can survive in southern Florida.

AB Most ecological systems comprise multiple species coexisting and the dynamics of these multiple species can be important for understanding, management, and conservation. One method to study such ecological system dynamics is the use of heterogeneous models. Here we formulate and analyze a multiple species (n patches or groups) consumer resource model. Initial insights are gained by analyzing the special cases and . A threshold consumption number C-0 is used to investigate system stability and hence the long-term dynamics of the system. It is shown how this threshold consumption number can measure the effects and extent of multiple species coexistence in the system.

ID FOREST BOUNDARY; DYNAMICS; COMPETITION; GROWTH; COVER; DETERMINANTS;

AB Theory and empirical evidence for the impacts of fire and herbivory in savannahs is well established - they are top-down disturbances that maintain savannahs in disequilibrium states away from potential tree cover. In African savannahs, the demand for fuelwood is extremely high, so tree harvest likely also has an impact, both directly and indirectly, on tree cover, density and biomass. Many savannah trees resprout vigorously from the base after harvest. However, harvested trees regenerate as saplings susceptible to fire and browsing, so harvest may have important demographic consequences. Here, we report the effects of tree harvest, and its interaction with fire and herbivory, on savannah dynamics by analysing woody regrowth following a harvest in arid Sahelian and mesic Guinean savannahs in Mali, West Africa. Tree harvest resulted in an overall reduction in wood production per tree compared to growth in nonharvested trees. Regrowth, either biomass or height, did not differ among fire and herbivory treatments. Our results suggest that the resprouting abilities that savannah trees have evolved to cope with frequent fire are essential for surviving tree harvest and subsequent disturbance. In these savannahs, regrowth is rapid enough in the first growing season to escape the impact of dry season fires.

AB Given the complexity and time-consuming of the conventional environmental capacity based assessment on air environment carrying capacity; a new method for assessing urban air environment carrying capacity based on air pollution index (API) is presented. By using this new method, the air environmental bearing capability of 333 cities at the prefecture level and above is assessed. The results show that of the 333 cities 9.6% is of high bearing capability, 34.5% relatively high bearing capability, 52.6% medium bearing capability, 2.7% low capability, and 0.6% is of weak bearing capability; in terms of regional distribution, the western region is of relatively high air environment bearing capability, followed by north-eastern and eastern regions, and the ambient air quality in the middle region is quite poor; among the 12 urban agglomerations in key regions, Pearl River delta, west side of Taiwan Strait and Chengdu-Chongqing agglomerations are of relatively high carrying capacity while other agglomerations are of medium bearing capability. The assessment results imply that the existing air quality standard (GB3095-1996) is quite unsound.

AB The objective of this work was to study the effect of topography and rainfall in the structure of trees and litter production in a tropical rain forest in the National Forest of Caxiuana. Were delimited three tranches of 1.000 m(2) in each topographic levels (lowland, intermediate and plateau) and identified all individuals and collection of litter. For the three levels was recorded a total of 124 species belonging to 33 botanical families. The three families with higher importance value index for topographies of lowland and intermediate were Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae and Chrysobalanaceae and for plateau were Lecythidaceae, Sapotaceae and Chrysobalanaceae. The species Lecythis idatimon Aubl., Rinoria guianensis Aubl. e Eschweilera coriacea (DC.) S.A. Mori. showed the greatest importance value indices for the three topographies. The seasonality affects significantly the litter production, showing the highest values at the end of rainy season and early dry season. The environmental stimulus for the fall of the leaves is mainly due to decrease in relative humidity, justified by the need of the plants to increase photosynthetic efficiency. The difference in population structure show strategies for flower production, and consequently the dispersion of fruits and seeds.

AB Aquatic macroinvertebrates harbor a broad spectrum of gut endosymbionts, among them trichomycetes species (including fungi and protozoa) are predominantly associated with shredders, collector or scraper hosts, which only rarely may ingest some animal tissues. An exception to this rule may be the protozoan Paramoebidium avitruviense, documented within opportunistic-predator nymphs of the stonefly Siphonoperla torrentium. In the present work, we studied a population of S. torrentium bearing P. avitruviense during 21 months to describe the life cycle and feeding habits of S. torrentium. We tested for associations between host diet, process of infestation and the prevalence of P. avitruviense, and provide information about the temporal dynamics of both the stonefly and the protozoan. Siphonoperla torrentium presented a univoltine life cycle and displayed an omnivorous diet which changed toward an invertebrate-based diet in older nymphs. The endosymbiont P. avitruviense showed fluctuations in relation to the host nymphal size, and prevalence peaks concurred with the highest host growth rate. Binary logistic regressions revealed that the diet influenced the prevalence of the protozoan, at least for some of the gut content fractions. Whereas an increment of the animal fraction decreased the probability of being infested, the consumption of other fractions related to a gatherer-collector activity increased the probabilities of infestation. However, the most decisive factor affecting endosymbiont prevalence was the melanization grade of S. torrentium, whereby the higher the melanization of the nymph (= longer post-ecdysis period), the higher the infestation probability by P. avitruviense.

AB Crustaceans in temporary wetlands have resting stages that allow them to persist in the soil during dry phases. We examined the spatial distribution of viable resting stages of invertebrates in the soil of playa wetlands. We took soil cores near the center and near the edge of the playas and in the surrounding upland of the dry playas. We then rehydrated the soil cores for two weeks. We found higher abundance and taxa richness, and a different taxonomic composition in the playa center than in the upland. Invertebrate abundance and taxa richness were intermediate at the wetland edge and taxonomic composition overlapped with that from the center and edge. Crustaceans (tadpole shrimps and calanoid copepods) were more abundant in the wetland center than from the edge or upland. Environmental factors and invertebrate behavior may play a role in organizing the spatial distribution of aestivating stages of aquatic invertebrates.

AB Crocodilian life history traits exhibit strong size and age dependence, which is determined, ultimately, by how fast individuals grow. Crocodilian population dynamics are dependent on environmental conditions such as local temperatures and hydrology. From February 2010 to October 2011 we conducted monthly spotlight surveys to study a broad-snouted caiman population at the Tres Marias Hydro-electric Reservoir, southeast Brazil. A total of 12 spotlight surveys were conducted (17.3 to 48.0 km in length), and animals were captured, measured and marked whenever possible. Data were obtained on population size, sex structure, survival, distribution and growth. The number of caimans counted, including hatchlings, varied from 6 to 78 per survey. Marked individuals showed a growth rate that varied between 0.0 and 0.3 cm*day(-1) SVL, and between -6.0 and 8.0 g*day(-1) body mass. Polyphasic growth was associated with rainfall and water level, which in turn were associated with changes in temperature and diet. The species seems to be resistant to the ecological impacts of damming, an important conservation conclusion considering the large number of hydroelectric dams within the species' range in Brazil.

AB Monitoring the sex ratio of elusive species, including tigers (Panthera tigris tigris Linnaeus, 1758), is an important aspect of population management and conservation. We collected 45 pugmarks made by the left hind foot pads of two adult male and seven adult female tigers in the core area of Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (RTR), India. We used linear and shape-based variables to develop a discriminant function model that distinguishes the sex of adult tigers using pugmarks. The accuracy of sex determination of male and female tigers using total length and total width was 87.5%. Using only the variable area of the pad, which is significantly different in male and female tigers, the sex of tigers could be distinguished accurately (100%). Our technique will facilitate the acquisition of sex-ratio data and the development of protocols for carrying out regional surveys and monitoring tiger populations in areas where pugmarks are easy to obtain.

AB We study the effect of learning with heterogeneous beliefs on the exploitation of a renewable common-pool resource. To that end, we extend the Great Fish War model of Levhari and Mirman (1980) to a learning environment in which several agents interact strategically and learn about the distribution of the stochastic evolution of the resource. We find that the effect of anticipation of learning with heterogeneous beliefs is twofold. First, the anticipation of learning makes future payoffs more uncertain, which induces the agents to decrease present exploitation due to the precautionary motive. Second, under heterogeneity of beliefs, there is a differential informational externality that induces the agents to increase or decrease present exploitation. We also perform a comparative analysis on the Cournot-Nash equilibrium with learning by studying the effect of optimism and riskiness on resource exploitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The temporal and spatial distributions of zooplankton communities in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, Zhejiang, China, were investigated monthly, between 2009 and 2010. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) dominated the pelagic fish community of this large, deep reservoir. Cladocerans were distributed evenly throughout the reservoir. Rotifers were mainly found in the upper reaches, while copepods tended to assemble in the lower reaches. The Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression were used to identify the major physicochemical gradients influencing community variations. Zooplankton community distributions were influenced by water temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon. Excess nutrients, in particular silicon, stimulated rotifer growth. Based on these findings, it is possible to use rotifer density as a bioindicator of eutrophic status in deep reservoir ecosystems.

AB Data on density, percentage of cover, and species richness were collected for grasses occurring in xeroriparian (desert riparian) areas across the Barry M. Goldwater Range, Arizona, to understand how native grasses occurring in isolated xeroriparian areas are related to use by wildlife, exotic invasive plants, and the surrounding floral community. These data were analyzed for significant associations with two aspects of landscape: adjoining matrix community of plants; distance from water-developments for wildlife (as a proxy for long-term use by wildlife). The adjoining matrix community, either Creosote-Bursage Desert Scrub or Palo Verde-Mixed Cacti-Mixed Scrub on Bajadas, had a significant influence on communities of native and exotic grasses in xeroriparian habitats, suggesting that observed characteristics of these communities can be predicted in the Sonoran Desert when large-scale distribution of floral communities are known. Increasing cover of exotic plants was associated with decreasing native richness. Distance to water-developments for wildlife had no significant relationship, suggesting that use associated with this water was not a significant driver of communities of grass.

AB The present study explores features of policy, management and legislation (PML) that may facilitate country's sustainable development with the account of business demands in national governance. The paper discusses former attempts to measure PML related aspects from the perspective of sustainability at different levels. In order to get business strategies function in harmony with sector and national strategies in a sustainable manner, a framework interconnecting PML and business is required. There are numbers of methodologies, including sophisticated criteria systems, elaborated to measure PML in terms of sustainability. However, none of these methodologies correspond to linkages among PML sustainability and business demands. Therefore, the paper aims to construct conceptual framework requirements for sustainable governance and explain effects of such requirements on business.
   Results of research indicate the hierarchy of measurable and aggregated overlapping criteria for evaluation of PML domains of sustainable strategy of a country. Among the most significant parameters are political, managerial and legitimate inclusion, level of corruption, balance of evidence based policy practice, process transparency, balance of interests, open process monitoring system, etc. These criteria represent principles of public in general and business in particular inclusion, rule of law and integrated solidarity based management that should be achieved for strategically driven sustainable development. Business motivation and engagement, stable and favorable political, procedural and legal environment, long-term strategy support via regulation, and other features of PML could secure sustainability of business strategy.

AB Network modularity is a well-studied large-scale connectivity pattern in networks. The detection of modules in real networks constitutes a crucial step towards a description of the network building blocks and their evolutionary dynamics. The performance of modularity detection algorithms is commonly quantified using simulated networks data. However, a comparison of the modularity algorithms utility for real biological data is scarce. Here we investigate the utility of network modularity algorithms for the classification of ecological plant communities. Plant community classification by the traditional approaches requires prior knowledge about the characteristic and differential species, which are derived from a manual inspection of vegetation tables. Using the raw species abundance data we constructed six different networks that vary in their edge definitions. Four network modularity algorithms were examined for their ability to detect the traditionally recognized plant communities. The use of more restrictive edge definitions significantly increased the accuracy of community detection, that is, the correspondence between network-based and traditional community classification. Random-walk based modularity methods yielded slightly better results than approaches based on the modularity function. For the whole network, the average agreement between the manual classification and the network-based modules is 76% with varying congruence levels for different communities ranging between 11% and 100%. The network-based approach recovered the known ecological gradient from riverside - sand and gravel bank vegetation - to dryer habitats like semidry grassland on dykes. Our results show that networks modularity algorithms offer new avenues of pursuit for the computational analysis of species communities.

AB Calciphile alpine vegetation has been a popular study object for more than a century, and numerous vegetation communities have previously been described and classified by phytosociological methods. Such available data give opportunity to explore three main questions in vegetation ecology: (1) Is it justifiable to separate vegetation types (clusters) in a nature that is assumed to vary along continuous gradients, and (2) if so, to what extent can separated phytosociological vegetation units be reproduced by a numerical classification, and (3) what are the main floristic gradients separating the communities? This study is based on data from 218 previously described communities from approximately 2270 releves and more than 1180 vegetation stands from different parts of Fennoscandia. The sampling unit used here is plant communities, and an importance value (IV) was calculated for all species (taxa) based on their frequency and mean cover. DCA axis 1 is interpreted as a "biomass or competition" axis separating tall herb vegetation from snow bed vegetation. DCA axis 2 is interpreted to represent a complex gradient with increasing length of snow cover and altitude separating snow beds, lee side vegetation and exposed vegetation. Twenty-two groups of communities were separated by the TWINSPAN classification program. Most of them show major overlap in the ordination space, and it gave limited support to previous phytosociological classifications. Communities in lee sides, snow beds and on exposed sites were, however, fairly well separated. Data on average altitudinal position and soil pH from some of the communities showed significant relationships with the community scores along the DCA axes. At high elevations the floristic gradients were strongly reduced; the lee side communities disappeared and the distinction between snow beds and communities on exposed sites became diffuse.

AB This paper presents the results of a household survey designed to qualitatively evaluate the impacts of the invasive alien species Senna spectabilis on the distribution of welfare across dependent communities in the Budongo Forest Reserve (BFR) in Uganda. The BFR is the largest forest reserve in Uganda, with globally significant conservation values. The study establishes that households in the BFR have high levels of knowledge as to its conservation values; they are aware of the invasiveness of S. spectabilis and its potential to compromise the conservation values of the BFR, and that S. spectabilis confers tangible benefits to dependent households, whose levels significantly vary with proximity to the reserve. The study concludes by evaluating strategies that are designed to manage the spread of S. spectabilis in the BFR and which consider its demonstrated socio-economic impacts.

TI WOOD ANATOMY OF CUSSONIA AND SEEMANNARALIA (ARALIACEAE) WITH SYSTEMATIC
   AND ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS
SO IAWA JOURNAL

ID TRENDS; SCHEFFLERA; TREES; GENUS
AB The wood structure of two related African genera, Cussonia Thunb. (15 of 21 species) and the monotypic Seemannamlia R.Vig. (Araliaceae) is examined. The considerable diversity in wood anatomical characters within these taxa is mostly related to environmental factors; taxonomic groupings or phylogenetic relationships seem to be less important. The shortening of vessel elements and fibres, an increase in vessel number per group, a decrease in vessel diameter and a reduction in the number of bars of perforation plates, are associated with the more temperate species. The changes in vessel grouping show a significant correlation with rainfall. The placement of the simple-leaved Cussonia species in the subgenus Protocussonia and the isolated position of C. paniculata Eckl. & Zeyh., the only member of the subgenus Paniculatae, are supported. Many Cussonia species share a very low fibre to vessel element length ratio. Despite the basal position of Seemannaralla relative to Cussonia revealed by molecular data (Plunkett et al. 2004), its wood structure is more specialised in terms of the Baileyan major trends in wood evolution. This discrepancy may be the effect of a long-term adaptation of tropical ancestors of Seemannaralia to drier biomes.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in foliar phenology plays a significant role in growth and reproduction of a plant species. Foliar phenology is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as rainfall. A study on phenology of tropical montane forests was undertaken in three different forest patches of the Nilgiri Mountains in peninsular India above 2000 meters ASL. Since August 2000, 500 trees belonging to 70 species of angiosperms were monitored for both vegetative and reproductive phenologies on a monthly basis. Climate data were collected from nearby weather stations. This paper reports results of the study from August 2000 - August 2003 on foliar phenology. Non-parametric correlations and multiple regressions were performed to analyse the influence of environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature and sunshine on foliar phenology. It was found that moisture related factors had a negative influence on the leaf initiation. Circular statistical analyses were performed to understand the seasonality in different phenophases of foliar phenology. Different phenophases of leafing were not significantly seasonal. Results are discussed and compared among three different forest patches on the Nilgiri plateau and also with other montane forest patches across the globe.

AB This paper is devoted to investigate extinction and nonextinction conditions of the extended Beverton-Holt equation (BHE) for dynamics of populations in Ecology when potential discontinuities at sampling points are included in the model. The proposed model is described by means of four sequences of parameters. Two of them are the intrinsic growth rate and the carrying capacity sequences which are included in the basic BHE model. The other two ones, namely, the harvesting (i.e., the hunting or fishing quota) and the internal consumption (which can include positive and negative migrations in the considered population habitat) sequences are included to parameterize the model discontinuities. Such discontinuities are related to impulses in the corresponding continuous-time logistic equation. The obtained results establish how the harvesting quota and/or the internal consumption has to be fixed to guarantee the population nonextinction or, eventually, its extinction. Finally, some controllability results related to the search of a carrying capacity sequence such that the solution of the proposed impulsive BHE tracks a reference one are obtained.

ID STANDING CROP; CATTLE; RESPONSES; RAINFALL; SAVANNA; GRASSLAND; IMPACTS;

AB A ten-year high stocking rate trial, mimicking communal areas was initiated at Matopos Research Station, Zimbabwe. Afrikaner steer crosses grazed continuously or rotationally at a high stocking rate (0.4 LU.ha(-1)) in two 45 ha areas, with one fenced into five 9 ha camps each for the rotational grazing sites, with 30 animals per site. It was hypothesized that, heavily stocked rotation will not improve herbage biomass, decreaser species abundance, basal cover or animal performance. Biomass, basal cover and decreaser species abundance were not (P > 0.05) significantly different between the grazing systems, save for Themeda triandra, Setaria incrassata and Panicum novemnerve, but were significant (P < 0.05) in terms of annual variation. Mean maximum steer weight gain was higher (P < 0.05) under continuous grazing. It was concluded that, the creation of rigid rotational grazing schemes in communal areas without proper stocking rates will not improve animal performance, herbage production, basal cover, but might have an effect on species abundance. In higher rainfall years, heavy stocking has no adverse effects on performance. Hence, any plans of grazing interventions on livestock management in communal areas, should consider stocking rate and rainfall, with a rapid stock reduction strategy in projected low rainfall years.

AB Moist lower montane vegetation has rarely been classified beyond broad zonational belts over large altitudinal ranges due to highly diverse species composition and structure. This study shows it is possible to further classify such forest types within Bwindi-Impenetrable National Park (BINP), and that these assemblages can be explained by a combination of environmental conditions and past management. Botanical and environmental data were collected along some 4000 m of linear transects from the area surrounding Mubwindi Swamp, BINP. Ordination using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and classification using Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) successfully identified four different species assemblages. These forest types were then named on the basis of the ecological characteristics of the species within the group, and the environmental conditions influencing the distribution and past disturbance of the forest. The techniques used were in agreement for three out of the four forest types identified. Analysis using an environmental overlay showed a significant association between forest type and altitude. The results of this study indicate that a regional classification of forest types within moist lower montane forest belt using only tree species is possible, and that the forest types identified can be explained by environmental conditions and past management.Resume
   La vegetation humide de basse montagne a rarement ete classee au-dela de larges ceintures de zonage portant sur des etendues de grandes amplitudes altitudinales, en raison de compositions et de structures d'especes extremement diverses. Cette etude montre qu'il est possible de classer plus precisement de tels types forestiers dans le Parc National de la Foret Impenetrable de Bwindi (BINP), et que l'on peut expliquer ces assemblages par une combinaison de conditions environnementales et de gestion passee. Des donnees botaniques et environnementales ont ete collectees le long de quelque 4,000 m de transects lineaires a partir de la zone entourant le Marais de Mubwindi, au BINP. L'ordination par la Gradation non metrique multidimensionnelle et la classification utilisant l'Analyse TWINSPAN (Two-way Indicator Species Analysis) ont reussi a identifier quatre assemblages d'especes differents. Ces types forestiers furent alors nommes en se basant sur les caracteristiques ecologiques des especes au sein du groupe ainsi que sur les conditions environnementales qui influencent la distribution et des perturbations anciennes des forets. Les techniques utilisees se sont montrees coherentes pour trois des quatre types de foret identifies. L'analyse utilisant une superposition environnementale a revele une association significative entre type forestier et altitude. Les resultats de cette etude indiquent qu'une classification regionale des types forestiers dans la ceinture forestiere humide qui entoure la basse montagne est possible en n'utilisant que trois especes d'arbres, et que les types forestiers identifies peuvent s'expliquer par les conditions environnementales et par la gestion anterieure.

AB We examined the effect of thermal shock on the germination of seeds of three conifers, two introduced (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus ponderosa), and one native to Patagonia (Araucaria araucana). Previous research has suggested increased susceptibility to invasions in burnt areas, and therefore, the effect of simulated fire (heat) on seed germination in these native and introduced species was compared. Seeds were heated to two different heat intensities (50 degrees C and 100 degrees C) for 1 or 5 min, which is within the temperature range reached in the upper soil layers during forest fires. Germination tests were then carried out in a growth chamber. The heat treatments had a negative effect on the germination of P. menziesii at temperatures of 100 degrees C, and a negative effect on the germination of P. ponderosa at the temperature of 100 degrees C and the exposure of 5 min. The heat treatments had no affect at all on A. araucana. The species with larger seeds (A. araucana) had higher survival rates after the thermal shocks. Also intraspecific differences in seed sizes possibly point at larger seeds surviving thermal shocks better than smaller seeds. In addition, thermal shock caused a delay in the onset of germination in the two introduced species, while it did not change the time for germination in A. araucana.

AB Factors influencing woody savanna vegetation structure across a land-use gradient of intensity (highly and lightly utilized communal rangeland) and type (national protected area, private game reserve and communal rangelands) were investigated Small-footprint discrete return LiDAR data (1 12 m point spacing) from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) 'Alpha system' were used to measure three-dimensional vegetation structure across the different treatments A volumetric pixel (voxel) approach was used to characterise the vertical distribution of LiDAR returns. i e, vegetation density, in one metre increments for comparison using descriptive statistics across the land-use type and intensity gradient Vegetation structure in the national protected area was most similar to the lightly utilized rangelands, and the private game reserve was most similar to the highly utilized rangelands with low levels of structural diversity present Current trends in structural diversity can be related to harvesting, regeneration, herbivory and fire

AB A detailed vegetation survey, describing floristic, structural and environmental features of 99 quadrates within a study area in the Fynbos Biome was completed. Various methods of vegetation survey were used to map and describe plant communities. These results were used to determine the feasibility of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to detect the plant communities and therefore the possibility to serve as an operational monitoring tool for coastal lowland fynbos. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to seven years' TM imagery as a method of data compression, whereby a statistical abstraction of the variability inherent in the original band sets was created and noise discarded. In this way representative imagery of several years' data were combined to serve as a baseline against which plant community change can be measured. Two supervised maximum likelihood classifications were done using this representative and a single year's (1997) imagery. Classification accuracy is based on the agreement between the classified imagery and compares favourably with field vegetation survey results. There is also a classification improvement between the single year's imagery and the combined imagery using PCA, therefore confirming the effective use of PCA to reduce noise and to obtain baseline imagery for monitoring purposes in coastal lowland fynbos.

AB Bacterial endosymbiosis is widespread in hydrothermal vent bivalves, and is typically developed in gill bacteriocytes, while it has never been described in the digestive gland. Using ultrastructural examination and DNA amplification analyses, we provide evidence for the existence of a potentially new group of environmental bacteria in the digestive gland of Bathymodiolus azoricus, which are genetically distinct from sulphur-oxidiser endosymbionts in its gills. The 16S rRNA partial gene sequences showed 99% identity in the gill and the digestive gland. Our results indicate that the same bacteria phylotypes are associated with different tissues in the host, and also that they do not result from a random infestation by free-living forms.

AB Reserves and sanctuaries are age-old tools for conservation of fishery resources, but they are underutilized in managing heavily fished stocks in stressed marine ecosystems. Conventional fisheries management, which emphasizes controlling catch and fishing effort, can be effective but is insufficient under some circumstances. A new emphasis on ecosystem-based fisheries management argues that spatial controls, including marine protected areas (MPAs), are desirable components of integrated ocean management plans. A National Research Council (NRC) study and report highlighted the importance of spatial heterogeneity and the need to incorporate it in fisheries management plans. The NRC study concluded that, under many circumstances, MPAs combined with conventional management can: protect habitats and nursery grounds, reduce bycatch, lower fishing mortality on prerecruits, promote "spillover" of recruited fish to unprotected areas, and provide a buffer against uncertainty. Poor understanding of stage-specific dispersal patterns of fish and behavior of fishers (i.e., distribution of effort) outside MPA boundaries constrains acceptance of MPAs by some scientists and managers. If implemented, MPAs must be enforced, monitored, and evaluated to ensure that innovative, incremental, and adaptive implementation of MPAs contributes substantively to precautionary fisheries management.

TI Recovery of thicket in a revegetated limestone mine
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
ID EASTERN CAPE
AB The opencast extraction of limestone at the PPC Cement (Pty) Ltd Loerie quarry in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, has led to disturbance of the immediate environment. Large tracts of thicket have been removed during mining and exhausted quarry areas had to be revegetated. Revegetation commenced 16 years ago and as a result of progressive revegetation efforts since then, five seral stages were available for study. This presented an opportunity to describe the successional progression that occurs where thicket topsoil was used for revegetation. The quarry lies near the Gamtoos fault and both thicket and mountain fynbos is found in proximity to the mine. Before mining, the area was covered by thicket and quarry floors were revegetated by covering landscaped areas with thicket topsoil. The vegetation that developed in the quarry had a very low floristic relationship to fynbos. After 16 years, the vegetation also had a low similarity to thicket, even though the soils used for revegetation contained thicket propagules. The oldest seral stage (16 years) was a Rhus incisa-Panicum deustum thicket in which only 46% of the species were mature thicket species. In order to develop thicket more rapidly, active intervention will be required. This could take the form of planting of saplings of key thicket species. A trial planting of such saplings showed high survival success of most species. Long-term (50 year) monitoring will be required to determine whether this approach was successful.

AB While the ecology of seed dispersal has been widely studied, the ecology of nutrient dispersal has not. Growing concerns about loss of biodiversity has resulted in an increasing number of studies on anadromous fishes as vectors for uploading and dispersing marine nutrients into freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems through various pathways. As an outgrowth of the idea of Lindebroom (1984), who analyzed the penguin-derived "animonia shadow" over a vigorous plant growth on an Antarctic island, this paper develops the concept of the "nutrient shadow" as the geographical space on terrestrial land that is covered by marine nutrients, due primarily to anadromous fishes, especially Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., and secondarily to other animals that have fed upon them. Here, I present a quantitative estimate of the relative position of anadromous salmon as vectors of marine nutrientupload-ing onto lands compared with those of marine fishery by human hands and of guano (sea birds' feces) occurrences as a final product of upwelling ecosystems. Then, I assess the extent of the nutrient shadow cast by spawning runs of salmon in view of the dynamics of nutrient condensation and dispersal (thinning) and conclude with some speculation about the vastness, albeit thin, of salmon-derived nutrient shadows over wild environments and the effects of anadromous salmon on fertilizing terrestrial ecosystems that may even be larger than those of marine fishery and guano occurrence, if we interpret such fertilization as the material basis for increasing biodiversity.

AB Behavioral interactions among four species of nudibranchs (Dendronotus frondosus, Doto coronata, Eubranchus exiguus, and Tergipes tergipes) were studied to determine whether interference governs their distributions and feeding locations within colonies of the hydroid Obelia geniculata. Initial behaviors displayed by nudibranchs when approaching other nudibranchs were similar. Nudibranchs initiated contact by touching with the rhinophores or apparent ''tasting'' with the oral lobes. Encounters were brief, and the response of any nudibranch to contact varied, but was generally non-aggressive. Nudibranchs were not displaced from an area within a hydroid colony by heterospecific nudibranchs. The locations of Tergipes, Dendronotus, and Doto were affected by an increased density of conspecifics, but this pattern was inconsistent. Interspecific interactions between nudibranchs did not dictate where a nudibranch fed within the hydroid colony. In particular, the apparent lack of a limiting resource and the absence of aggressive interactions among individuals suggest that competition is unimportant in this community.

AB 1. Contemporary ecosystems commonly support multiple non-native species, which can alter community structure and directly or indirectly interact with one another. Novel interactions between invasive species can result in the facilitation or suppression of one or both invaders, making it important to understand the underlying mechanisms that affect invasion outcomes.2. Goldfish Carassius auratus and Chinese mystery snails Cipangopaludina chinensis have been introduced widely through the aquarium trade and co-occur in their non-native ranges. We used an outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess separate and combined effects of goldfish and mystery snails on urban pond community structure and to investigate whether goldfish and mystery snails affected one another positively, neutrally or negatively. We predicted that the distinct trophic levels of each species and the anti-predator traits of mystery snails would lead to positive interactions between invaders and synergistic effects on the aquatic community.3. Goldfish directly increased turbidity and decreased filamentous algae, zooplankton, juvenile native snails and survival of amphibians via consumptive effects. Goldfish indirectly increased periphyton, phytoplankton and body size of surviving native green frogs Lithobates clamitans through trophic cascades and/or release from competition. Mystery snails had more subtle effects including reducing growth rates of native grey tree frogs Hyla versicolor, likely through competitive interactions.4. With goldfish present, mystery snails showed increased reproductive success (higher biomass of juveniles), likely due to indirect competitive release from other herbivores. In contrast to their effects on native snails, goldfish did not consume juvenile mystery snails, likely due to their unique traits (e.g. large size and shell thickness). Mystery snails slightly reduced goldfish growth but did not affect their survival.5. These results suggest unidirectional facilitation between invaders via indirect changes in the food web. Overall, our study found strong direct and indirect effects of invasive aquarium species, particularly goldfish, and provides experimental support for the invasional meltdown hypothesis within urban waterbodies, which are especially prone to invasions.

AB The "inverse modelling through iterative forward modelling" (IMIFM) approach is used to reconstruct the last deglaciation climates from central equatorial African mountains. Unlike other approaches that use statistical models, it directly incorporates the effects of changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation through a process-based vegetation model, but the results strongly depend on the model used. Therefore, two generally related but different equilibrium vegetation models are used for evaluating the dependence of the results on the choice of vegetation model. Our climate reconstructions show that long-term temperature increases during the last deglaciation, as seen in Greenland, were absent from many of the target sites. Moreover, there are few common long-term trends of climatic responses during the last deglaciation among central equatorial African mountains' sites despite the relatively close of those sites. No systematic climate responses were also found between the eastern and western sides of the Congo basin. While there is consistency in the long-term trends and their amplitudes regarding temperature reconstructions with both models, there are large differences between the sites in the long-term hydroclimatic reconstructions, particularly during arid periods. This difference may be attributed to the carbon-water use efficiency in the vegetation models. This study implies that the IMIFM approach is effective for climate reconstructions in equatorial African mountains, where modern pollen samples are not plentiful. Although low atmospheric CO2 concentrations do not largely influence temperature reconstructions for the last deglaciation, they significantly affect the hydroclimate reconstructions, especially when drought-tolerant biomes are dominant.

AB In this study, the integration of useful statistical methods from different disciplines for analyzing the forest community of the Lienhuachih area of central Taiwan was attempted. We employed a seriated heat map to confirm the presence of multiple community patterns in the area and used the gap statistics and a clustplot to confirm the number and structure of the patterns, respectively. A minimum spanning tree was used to display a succession series among the quadrats, and Renyi diversity was used to indicate the species composition of these patterns. The results confirmed the existence of six patterns with different biodiversity structures in which pattern C was the succession prototype of the local community patterns. Next, we used the patterns as nodes of a social network to perform bipartite network analysis. The results showed that a community network consisted of 108 taxa and six syntaxa. The syntaxa were highly vulnerable to extinction; therefore, the optimal conservation strategy for local species would be to first protect the syntaxa. The random forest method and bipartite modularity were used to analyze the dominant characteristic species of the six syntaxa. The results showed that these two methods are useful for detecting characteristic species of the syntaxa. Therefore, this study proposed a new nomenclature system, namely the Mathematic Code of Syntaxonomic Nomenclature, to support the results of numerical vegetation analysis. Finally, the potential for an apparently competitive network was examined, the role of an apparently competitive network in the local structuring community was explored, and six new associations in the Lienhuachih area were described.

AB Savannas cover a significant fraction of the Earth's land surface. In these ecosystems, C-3 trees and C-4 grasses coexist persistently, but the mechanisms explaining coexistence remain subject to debate. Different quantitative models have been proposed to explain coexistence, but these models make widely contrasting assumptions about which mechanisms are responsible for savanna persistence. Here, we show that no single existing model fully captures all key elements required to explain tree-grass coexistence across savanna rainfall gradients, but many models make important contributions. We show that recent empirical work allows us to combine many existing elements with new ideas to arrive at a synthesis that combines elements of two dominant frameworks: Walter's two-layer model and demographic bottlenecks. We propose that functional rooting separation is necessary for coexistence and is the crux of the coexistence problem. It is both well-supported empirically and necessary for tree persistence, given the comprehensive grass superiority for soil moisture acquisition. We argue that eventual tree dominance through shading is precluded by ecohydrological constraints in dry savannas and by fire and herbivores in wet savannas. Strong asymmetric grass-tree competition for soil moisture limits tree growth, exposing trees to persistent demographic bottlenecks.

AB Species invasions are a leading threat to ecosystems globally, but our understanding of interactions among multiple invasive species and their outcomes on ecosystem properties is undeveloped despite their significance to conservation and management. Here we studied a large lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term (2000-2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and productivity (-93% and -91%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake. Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued ecosystem service.

   EVOLUTION
AB Tree species of Eurasian broadleaved forest possess two divergent trait syndromes with contrasting patterns of resource allocation adapted to different selection environments: short-stature basal resprouters that divert resources to a bud bank adapted to frequent and severe disturbances such as fire and herbivory, and tall trees that delay reproduction by investing in rapid height growth to escape shading. Drawing on theory developed in savanna ecosystems, we propose a conceptual framework showing that the possession of contrasting trait syndromes is essential for the persistence of broadleaved trees in an open ecosystem that burns. Consistent with this hypothesis, trees of modern Eurasian broadleaved forest bear a suite of traits that are adaptive to surface and crown-fire regimes. We contend that limited opportunities in grassland restricts recruitment to disturbance-free refugia, and en masse establishment creates a wooded environment where shade limits the growth of light-demanding savanna plants. Rapid height growth, which involves investment in structural support and the switch from a multi-stemmed to a monopodial growth form, is adaptive in this shaded environment. Although clustering reduces surface fuel loads, these establishment nuclei are vulnerable to high-intensity crown fires. The lethal effects of canopy fire are avoided by seasonal leaf shedding, and aerial resprouting enhances rapid post-fire recovery of photosynthetic capacity. While these woody formations satisfy the structural definition of forest, their constituents are clearly derived from savanna. Contrasting trait syndromes thus represent the shift from consumer to resource regulation in savanna ecosystems. Consistent with global trends, the diversification of most contemporary broadleaved taxa coincided with the spread of grasslands, a surge in fire activity and a decline in wooded ecosystems in the late Miocene-Pliocene. Recognition that Eurasian broadleaved forest has savanna origins and persists as an alternative state with adjacent grassy ecosystems has far-reaching management implications in accordance with functional rather than structural criteria. Shade is a severe constraint to the regeneration and growth of both woody and herbaceous growth forms in consumer-regulated ecosystems. However, these ecosystems are highly resilient to disturbance, an essential process that maintains diversity especially among the species-rich herbaceous component that is vulnerable to shading when consumer behaviour is altered.

AB The captive breeding of wildlife for commercial purposes is a controversial issue. In South Africa, the farming of African lions (Panthera leo) for commercial trade emerged in the early 1990s, partly as a conservation measure to reduce the decline in wild lion numbers while meeting increasing wildlife trade demands. In May 2021, the South African Department of Forestry, Fisheries, and the Environment (DFFE) announced plans to end the captive breeding of lions, keeping of lions in captivity, and the use of captive lions, their parts and derivatives for commercial trade. Here, we examined the commercial captive lion industry from 2017 to 2020 in the Free State province, the heart of the lion breeding industry. We document the extent of the industry and highlight a number of key management issues. Of particular concern were issues with microchip numbers, which are used to follow each registered lion from birth to death through the system and to avoid laundering of wild caught and/or non-registered lions. Of the 4,823 unique microchips that were identified, at least 11% could not be followed through the system. Additionally, a minimum of 199 microchip numbers may have been reused by permit holders, either on captivity, euthanasia, or transport permits, indicating potential non-compliance with the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations. We highlight further areas of concern that warrant additional attention for these types of activities that may cause management issues during the transition period and which may also be relevant for the keeping, breeding, and trading of other TOPS regulated species in South Africa, particularly big cat species.

AB The recruitment of the endangered limpet Patella ferruginea in the Chafarinas Islands (SW Mediterranean) was studied over a 17-year period (1999-2015). A total of 8115 recruits <20 mm in maximum diameter were counted in 95 transect censuses sampled during the study period. The presence of recruits began at the end of winter or beginning of spring (March-April), when they reached a maximum shell diameter (MD) of at least 4 mm, with a peak in abundance occurring in spring. Smaller recruits were found on the lower infralittoral on the fringe of the vermetid gastropod Dendropoma lebeche and the crustose coralline algae Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, which suggests that settlement occurs at this shore level. Recruits reach 12-27 mm at the end of their first year of life. A regular recruitment was detected for all studied years, with an average of 11.71 recruits m(-1) across the study period. However, recruitment exhibited high interannual variability and did not occur evenly along the coastline of the islands. Higher recruitment was observed in 2001, 2011 and 2012, with a maximum density of 69.07 recruits m(-1) in one transect in 2012. The density of recruits decreased in summer. No significant correlation was found between the density of recruits and adults. Between 1999-2010, 29.29% of recruits were 'phoretic' on the shell of adults (1.81 recruits per host on average). Recruits climbed on to adults sometime after settlement, thus we suggest that 'phoresy' could favour the survival of young limpets instead of being due to selective settlement on adults. To improve and standardize recruitment monitoring in future studies, we propose that recruits are considered as those specimens <20 mm in MD and that recruitment censuses are carried out in spring, with additional censuses after summer to detect juvenile mortality. Additionally, we propose that 1 mm interval size classes are used for growth studies based on size-frequency analyses.

AB Oyster larvae reared in hatcheries on the U.S. West coast often experience severe Vibrio coralliilyticus-related mortalities early in their development. Current treatment options for these molluscs are either not available or feasible; however, for decades, probiotics have been successfully used in finfish and crustacean shellfish culture. Consequently, the objectives of this work were to 1) isolate marine bacteria from oysters and evaluate their protective activity against Vibrio coralliilyticus infection of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae, and 2) to determine the long-term effects of probiotic additions on growth and metamorphosis of larval Pacific and Kumamoto oysters (C. sikamea). A combination of three probiotic strains applied once 24 h post-fertilization was more effective in improving survival of larval C. gigas exposed to lethal concentrations of V. coralliilyticus strain RE22, compared with separate additions of individual probiotics. In addition, a single application of the probiotic combination to one-day-old larvae increased the larval metamorphosis success of C. sikamea and both the Midori and Myiagi stocks of C. gigas. These results suggest that probiotics are effective at preventing bacterial infections and can significantly improve performance of oyster larvae, using a single application early in their development.

AB Xylella fastidiosa (Wells 1987, hereafter Xf), the causal agent of several devastating plant diseases, is threatening new countries of the Euro-Mediterranean, Balkans, Middle East, and North Africa (MENA) regions. In this perspective, a study was carried out to: (a) explore the potential establishment and spread and losses caused by Xf in Euro-Mediterranean countries (i.e., France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and the Balkans (i.e., Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia); (b) assess the potential introduction of Xf in the MENA countries (i.e., Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey); and (c) project the socio-economic impacts of Xf on olives, grapes, citrus, and almonds in these countries. A novel socio-economic risk assessment technique was developed and applied for these purposes. It revealed that Albania had the highest risk for Xf dispersal. In addition, the risk assessment also confirmed the vulnerability of Euro-Mediterranean countries in terms of Xf dispersal. In the MENA and Balkans regions, countries with fragmented and small farms are likely to face the worst social impacts, whereas the Euro-Mediterranean region runs the highest economic losses on the target crops.

AB Recognition of the seed crop size and the periodicity of abundant seed production is essential for the management and control of introduced tree species. Here we studied acorn production of the North American northern red oak, Quercus rubra - the most common commercially important and invasive alien tree in European forests. A four-year (2017-2020) study conducted in even-aged Q. rubra stands, planted 55-60 years ago in sites of coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forests in central Poland, revealed a great variation in size of premature and mature acorn yields both among stands within the same year and among years for the same stand. However, each year numerous acorns of the introduced oak entered existing ecosystems, and the supply of mature propagules was more stable in the studied forests than in the Q. rubra native range. The total acorn crop was correlated significantly with the forest site, however, the forest site had a weaker effect on Q. rubra masting than the weather. Increases in abortion of acorns and decreases in mature acorn crops were preceded by reproductioninhibiting weather events, and lower crops of mature acorns were correlated with abundant premature acorn abscission. In reaction to the weather, the phenology of premature and mature acorn shedding was very variable in subsequent years, but it was synchronized in time among all forest sites studied. The size of seed crop at the stand level was shaped by acorn crops of the highly-productive trees, and their identification within stands can be crucial for both effective management and control of Q. rubra in European forests.

AB Centres of endemism have been much studied by biogeographers, ecologists, and evolutionary theorists, and are considered conservation priorities. It is therefore important to understand the ecological traits of restricted range taxa, and the landscape-scale drivers of high endemism. Here, we investigate correlates of floristic endemism within two of west Africa's forest biodiversity hotspots at local scale. We assembled distribution data for 1,042 vascular plant taxa from 114 sample locations within forest reserves of south west Ghana, and for 1,735 vascular plant taxa from 454 sample locations within the Nimba Mountains (Liberia and Guinea). A quantitative index of global endemism called the Genetic Heat Index was modelled linearly. We tested the significance of modern climate, altitude and disturbance as factors predicting endemism rates in these two forest reserves. Annual rainfall was significantly and positively related to endemism rates in both south west Ghana and the Nimba Mountains. Altitude was a significant predictor of endemism rates in the Nimba Mountains, with a quadratic relationship highlighting particularly high endemism over 1,000 m. Local topography rather than altitude was a significant predictor or endemism in SW Ghana, where altitude varies less. Areas of high rainfall and high altitude are geographically restricted across the western African forests, acting as edaphic islands driving spatial isolation. Disturbed vegetation samples had lower endemism rates than undisturbed samples in both Nimba and SW Ghana, and overall pioneer species had wider areas of occupancy than shade-bearing species. Endemism rates increased slightly with each year following clearance. Disturbance thus creates and maintains vegetation types which support a lower proportion of globally rare species in the two biodiversity hotspots surveyed. From the point of view of the conservation of globally rare plants, it is important to keep additional disturbance in the south west Ghana hotspot, particularly Ankasa, to a minimum, as is the current practice, and in the Nimba mountains to establish community forests which may be left relatively undisturbed amid farming and mining activities.

AB Desertification research in arid and semi-arid regions has always been actively pursued. In China, the problem of desertification in Xinjiang has also received extensive attention. Due to its unique geography, many scholars have conducted corresponding research on the desertification status of Xinjiang. In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed desertification in Xinjiang, and compared the underlying mechanisms of desertification and the status of desertification conditions after the implementation of ecological control projects. On a larger scale, desertification in Xinjiang can be divided into soil salinization inside oases and sandy desertification on the edges of oases. Human activities are considered the main cause of desertification, but natural factors also contribute to varying degrees. Research on the mechanisms of desertification has effectively curbed the development of desertification, but unreasonable use of land resources accelerates the risk of desertification. For desertification control, there are several key points. First, desertification monitoring and the early warning of desertification expansion should be strengthened. Second, monitoring and reversing soil salinization also play an important role in the interruption of desertification process. It is very effective to control soil salinization through biological and chemical methods. Third, the management of water resources is also essential, because unreasonable utilization of water resources is one of the main reasons for the expansion of desertification in Xinjiang. Due to the unreasonable utilization of water resources, the lower reaches of the Tarim River are cut off, which leads to a series of vicious cycles, such as the deterioration of ecological environment on both sides of the river and the worsening of desertification. However, in recent years, various desertification control projects implemented in Xinjiang according to the conditions of different regions have achieved remarkable results. For future studies, research on the stability of desert-oasis transition zone is also significantly essential, because such investigations can help to assess the risk of degradation and control desertification on a relatively large scale.

AB The use of green and renewable energies undeniably plays an essential role in today's society. Energy from these sources plays a key role in transforming the energy sector and significantly impacts the way of life and the quality of life of different social groups. The main aspects of this study are to briefly describe the situation of clean and renewable energy in Hungary and to investigate the extent to which the younger generation of different social groups is involved in using renewable energy sources in their everyday lives and their attitudes towards environmental awareness. In our research, we also investigate whether there is a strong statistical correlation between environmental awareness, environmentally damaging activities and the perceptions of different environmental problems among the target groups and, if so, how these affect the research topic. Our primary research can be considered representative, as we surveyed all primary and secondary school students in the Gyongyos micro-region of the North-Hungarian region and also included the opinion of university students in the mentioned micro-region. The questionnaire was asked in person, and 2180 students completed it. The research was carried out in several phases, the first occurring between 2017 and 2019 and the second between 2020 and 2021. Three research questions were formulated, and the main findings show that the students' main goal in the research was not to protect or support the environment but to prefer material well-being and related factors. On the results of statistical correlation analyses, overall, the examination by educational level (primary, secondary and higher) does not show significant differences between student groups, i.e., students with higher education do not have higher levels of environmental awareness and attitudes. Another important finding is that using renewable energy sources is considered too expensive for low-income families to take advantage of this kind of energy.

AB Background Changes in climate and the intensity of agriculture expansion can alter plant population dynamics and community composition and structure of dry shrublands. Aims We tested how temperature and moisture along an elevation gradient, grazing, and nutrient addition in soil affected demographic attributes of Croton shrubs and the composition and structure of plant species in an inter-Andean dry shrubland. Methods At three elevations, we installed grazing and exclusion plots, combined with four nutrient treatments: control, and addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) alone and in combination. We measured recruitment and survival of Croton seedlings, as well as survival, growth, fruiting of adult Croton and the composition and structure of neighbouring plants. Results Grazing exclusion improved adult survival of Croton at all three elevations. Grazing exclusion and addition of N and P increased adult growth of Croton at low and medium elevations. Croton seedling recruitment and survival decreased with distance to adult plants. The cover of Croton had a positive relationship with plant abundance and diversity. Conclusions Temperature, moisture, grazing and nutrient addition can alter the demography and cover of Croton, as well as the composition and structure of its neighbouring plants threatening the functioning of the inter-Andean dry shrubland.

AB This work deals with the consequences of climate warming on aquatic ecosystems. The study determined the effects of increased water temperatures in artificial lakes during winter on predicting changes in the biomass of zooplankton taxa and their environment. We applied an innovative approach to investigate the effects of winter warming on zooplankton and physico-chemical factors. We used a modelling scheme combining hierarchical clustering, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithms. Under the influence of increased water temperatures in winter, weight- and frequency-dominant Crustacea taxa such as Daphnia cucullata, Cyclops vicinus, Cryptocyclops bicolor, copepodites and nauplii, and the Rotifera: Polyarthra longiremis, Trichocerca pusilla, Keratella quadrata, Asplanchna priodonta and Synchaeta spp. tend to decrease their biomass. Under the same conditions, Rotifera: Lecane spp., Monommata maculata, Testudinella patina, Notholca squamula, Colurella colurus, Trichocerca intermedia and the protozoan species Centropyxis acuelata and Arcella discoides with lower size and abundance responded with an increase in biomass. Decreases in chlorophyll a, suspended solids and total nitrogen were predicted due to winter warming. Machine learning ensemble models used in innovative ways can contribute to the research utility of studies on the response of ecological units to environmental change.

AB Mountain pastures are essential for maintainig biodiversity and local economies. Despite the great value and fragility of these ecosystems, an up-to-date overview of extent and type of alpine pastures is lacking in many areas of the Alps. In this study, the interpretation of ancillary information combined with expeditious field campaigns, and the harmonization of classification methodologies allowed us to: (1) define the spatial extent of mountain pastures; (2) identify the non-grazeable percentage in these areas; (3) Characterize and map pasture types within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), where 4596 ha of grazeable areas were mapped. Among the 13 categories identified, the three most represented in the park are Bare thermophile grasslands (38%), Nardus swards (20%), and Alpine intermediate grasslands (18%). The maps obtained in this study are useful for animal management during the grazing season, and have the capability of geographically assessing potential forage avaibility through modeling and remote sensing data.

AB Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) was distributed from its natural range in western North America to different destinations, primarily to Europe (Scandinavia, British Islands), South America (Chile, Argentina), and New Zealand. It is used for its superior timber production and resistance to environmental conditions. This literature review paper consists of 150 references and presents a summary of research results dealing with the lodgepole pine potential in general with a specific focus on Europe from 1910 to 2022. It summarizes the importance, taxonomy, biological and ecological characteristics, site requirements, production and silviculture, risks and pests, as well as the potential of this tree species for forestry and the wood industry in relation to global climate change. Pinus contorta also has a considerable potential in Central Europe, especially at extreme sites with strong anthropogenic impact and in polluted regions. This tree species is very resistant to climatic factors and extreme events compared to other coniferous tree species. Moreover, its annual increment reached from 3 m(3)center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) on reclamation sites to 18 m(3)center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) in favourable environmental conditions. On the other hand, caution must be taken for possible invasive behaviour outside its natural range. Its importance can increase with ongoing climate change and the decline of native tree species.

AB The dynamics and adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems are heavily contingent on system structure, which is established through geography, institutions, interactions, and movement. Contrasting views of system structure, as hierarchies and single-level networks respectively, have tended to emphasize the role of either top-down or lateral (peer-to-peer) connections. The concept of a heterarchy aims to capture both top-down and lateral connections on orthogonal axes and has been proposed as a way of unifying alternative approaches to measuring structure, but it has not been fully operationalized for quantifying and comparing system structures. We developed a simple approach to consistently quantifying heterarchical structure across different kinds of networks. We first calculated suitable metrics, including modularity and a hierarchy score, for a wide range of both simulated and real-world systems including food webs, biological, infrastructure, and social networks. Metrics were corrected for differences in size and magnitude. The results were then visualized as a heterarchy matrix. We compared the angle (degrees) and Euclidian distance of each simulated and real-world network from the center of the matrix between network groups. All networks showed distinct placement on the heterarchy matrix. Relative to one another, food webs were laterally polycentric, social networks were mainly pyramidal and coordinated polycentric, and biological networks were pyramidal and laterally polycentric. Our test of concept, although relatively basic, provides strong evidence that system structure cannot be fully understood as purely laterally connected or purely hierarchical. System resilience requires a tradeoff between modularity, aiding redundancy and collaboration; and hierarchy, aiding efficient action. Our approach has the potential to provide a robust, accessible methodology to quantify system structure that allows for universal contextualization, a key step within fields such as resilience and sustainability science.

   DEMOGRAPHY
AB African savannas are experiencing anthropogenically-induced stressors that are accelerating the increase of woody vegetation cover. To combat this, land managers frequently implement large-scale clearing of trees, which can have a cascading influence on mammalian herbivores. Studies rarely focus on how differences in woody cover influence the herbivore assemblage, making it difficult to assess how aggressive measures, or the lack of management, to counteract increasing woody cover affect the local composition and biodiversity of herbivores. We address this knowledge gap by applying a model-based clustering approach to field observations from MalaMala Game Reserve, South Africa to identify multiple herbivore-vegetation 'configurations,' defined as unique sets of herbivore assemblages (i.e., groups of herbivores) associated with differing woody plant covers. Our approach delineated how tree-clearing influences the distribution and abundance of the herbivore community in relation to surrounding savanna areas, which represent a natural mosaic of varying woody cover. Regardless of season, both intensively managed areas cleared of trees and unmanaged areas with high tree cover contained configurations that had depauperate assemblages of herbivores (low species richness, low abundance). By contrast, habitats with intermediate cover of woody vegetation had much higher richness and abundance. These results have substantial implications for managing African savannas in a rapidly changing climate.

AB Environmental disturbances influence bacterial community structure and functioning. To investigate the effect of environmental disturbance caused by changes in salinity on host-protected bacterial communities, we analyzed the microbiome within the gastrointestinal tract of Ampullaceana balthica in different salinities. A. balthica is a benthic gastropod found in fresh- and mesohaline waters. Whereas the total energy reserves of A. balthica were unaffected by an increase of salinity to 3, a high mortality rate was detected after a shift from freshwater to salinity 6 suggesting a major disruption of energy homeostasis. The shift to salinity 6 also caused a change in the gastrointestinal bacterial community composition. At salinity 3, the bacterial community composition of different host individuals was related either to the freshwater or salinity 6 gastrointestinal bacterial community, indicating an ambivalent nature of salinity 3. Since salinity 3 represents the range where aquatic gastropods are able to regulate their osmolarity, this may be an important tipping point during salinization. The change in the intestinal microbiome was uncoupled from the change in the water bacterial community and unrelated to the food source microbiome. Our study shows that environmental disturbance caused by salinity acts also on the host-protected microbiome. In light of the sea-level rise, our findings indicate that salinization of the near-shore freshwater bodies will cause changes in organisms' intestinal microbiomes if a critical salinity threshold (presumably similar to 3) is exceeded.

AB Aim: This study aimed to investigate the distribution patterns of plant diversity in Kenya, how climatic fluctuations and orogeny shaped them, and the formation of its beta-diversity.
   Location: Kenya, East Africa.
   Taxon: Angiosperms.
   Methods: We quantified patterns of turnover and nestedness components of phylogenetic beta-diversity for angiosperm species among neighbouring sites using a well-resolved phylogenetic tree and extensive distribution records from public databases and other published sources. We applied clustering methods to delineate biota based on pairwise similarities among multiple sites and used a random assembly null model to assess the effects of species abundance distribution on phylogenetic beta-diversity.
   Results: The phylogenetic turnover of the Kenyan flora, intersecting with the biodiversity hotspots Eastern Afromontane, Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, and Horn of Africa, shows a non-monotonic pattern along a latitudinal gradient that is strongly structured into volcanic and coastal areas. The other areas are mainly dominated by phylogenetic nestedness, even in the eastern part of the equatorial region parallel to the volcanic area. Phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic structure analyses explain the mechanism of the observed phylogenetic turnover and nestedness patterns. We identified five phytogeographical regions in Kenya: the Mandera, Turkana, Volcanic, Pan Coastal and West Highland Regions.
   Conclusions: Variations in turnover gradient and coexistence are highly dependent on the regional biogeographical history resulting from climatic fluctuations and longlasting orogeny, which jointly shaped the biodiversity patterns of the Kenyan flora. The nestedness component dominated climatically unstable regions and is presumed to have been caused by heavy local species extinction and recolonization from Volcanic Region. The high turnover component in climatically stable regions may have preserved old lineages and the prevalence of endemic species within narrow ranges.

AB Investigating the spatio-temporal patterns of desertification and its driving mechanisms is crucial for efforts to improve the ecology and environment and combat desertification. Based on meteorological and satellite remote sensing data, this paper analyzed the dynamic characteristics of desertification in the Hexi region of arid and semiarid land in Northwest China from 2000 to 2018 using a dimidiate pixel model; revealed the relationship between desertification evolution characteristics and climatic variations and anthropogenic events based on the change characteristics of net primary productivity (NPP); and then clarified the response of desertification to climatic variations and anthropogenic events using a geodetector model. Outcomes show that: (1) overall desertification in Hexi region is at a serious level, but during the study period, severe desertification decreased, mainly concentrated in the east and southwest, and non-desertification increased, mainly near the Qilian Mountains and Shule River basin; (2) there were both spatial and temporal dynamics during the study period, with severe desertification decreasing by 11% and moderate, light, and non-desertification increasing by 3%, 5%, and 3% respectively; (3) during 2000-2005, human activities, climate change, and their joint contribution to desertification reversal were similar, i.e., 23%, 40%, and 36%, and the former two contributed equally to desertification expansion, 38% and 41%, respectively; climate change predominated in desertification reversal in 2005-2010 and 2015-2018, while human activities predominated in desertification expansion; human activities predominated in desertification reversal and climate change predominated in desertification expansion in 2010-2015. This research can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for ecological and environmental management and sustainable socio-economic development in arid and semiarid regions.

AB Numerical biophysical models are a standard methodology used to provide estimates of larval dispersal and population connectivity for marine species with a bi-phasic life cycle. However, confidence on biophysical models, tested by confronting model estimates with empirical evidence, is seldomly assessed. We compared time-series estimates of larval supply of the stalked barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes to rocky shores in 3 regions around the Iberian Peninsula (Asturias, Galicia, SW Portugal) with recruitment observations made at monthly intervals for 2 yr. Supply estimates were made with the Regional Ocean Modelling system using several larval behaviour scenarios, while the number of recruits on the stalks of adult barnacles was used as a measure of recruitment intensity. Cross-correlation analysis showed that passive, surface-dwelling and ontogenetically migrating larval scenarios generally produced significant positive correlations at time lags of 0 to + 2 mo at the regional level but not at sub-regional or site levels. None of the scenarios produced a substantially better fit than the others, and all 3 produced estimates of average realized dispersal (-73 to + 63 km in the S/W and N/E directions) and larval retention (2.0 to 2.4%) that were numerically very similar. These estimates indicate high levels of connectivity, either during larval life or via steppingstone processes, within and between the 3 regions. Based on these estimates, we advocate that the management of the P. pollicipes fishery requires an interactive, polycentric governance system at transregional, regional and local scales, which will give the resource a higher possibility of persistence by diversifying the fishery's management portfolio.

AB The article proposes a framework establishing a disaster resilience index applicable worldwide that accounts for differences between countries in terms of development and in terms of the relevance of several resilience dimensions. To achieve this index, countries were clustered using an indicator that reflected their performance according to the Sustainable Development Goals. For each cluster of countries, a Delphi process was used to obtain scores for every resilience dimension and sub-dimension that were then transformed into weights that varied from cluster to cluster to reflect differences in sustainable development. The article discusses the methodology that led to the quantification of the weights according to the Delphi process, as well as its results. The results highlighted the anticipated differences between different groups of countries, but also reflected cluster-specific features that should be accounted for when analyzing disaster resilience. The article also discusses different applications and possible improvements of the proposed framework based on comments collected during the Delphi process.

AB Understanding grassland dynamics and their relationship to weather and grazing is critical for pastoralists whose livelihoods depend on grassland productivity. Studies investigating the impacts of climate and human factors on inter-seasonal grassland dynamics have focused mostly on changes to vegetation structure. Yet, quantifying the impact of these on the inter-seasonal dynamics of specific grassland communities is not known. This study uses digital repeat photography to examine how intra-seasonal grassland dynamics of different grassland communities are affected by precipitation, temperature, and grazing in a heterogeneous semi-arid savannah in Kenya. A low-cost digital repeat camera network allowed for fine-scale temporal and spatial variability analysis of grassland dynamics and grazing intensity. Over all grass communities, our results show precipitation driving mainly early-season and in some cases mid-season flushing, temperature driving end-of-season senescence, and grazing influencing mid-season declines. Yet, our study quantifies how these three drivers do not uniformly impact grassland species communities. Specifically, Cynodon and Cynodon/Bothriochloa communities are rapidly and positively associated with precipitation, where mid-season declines in Cynodon communities are associated with grazing and late-season declines in Cynodon/Bothriochloa communities are associated with temperature increases. Setaria communities, on the other hand, have weaker associations with the drivers, with limited positive associations with precipitation and grazing. Kunthii/Digitaria diverse communities had no association with the three drivers. Highly diverse mixed communities were associated with increased precipitation and temperature, as well as lower intensity grazing. Our research sheds light on the complex interactions between plants, animals, and weather. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates the potential of digital repeated photography to inform about fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of semi-arid grassland vegetation and grazing, with the goal of assisting in the formulations of management practises that better capture the intra-annual variability of highly heterogeneous dryland systems.

AB Savanna fire has many types: Savanna woody, Savanna vegetation, and grassland. In this paper, Savanna vegetation is studied, characterized by low trees and high grass. It grows in hot and seasonally dry conditions. The Savanna vegetation is described by relating to the environment and climate. Savanna vegetation is considered a metastable mixture of trees and grass and is advanced to explain stability. The Savanna vegetation is modeled with first-order linear differential equations having grass, trees, and sapling (young trees) as components. Furthermore, the model is evaluated numerically by integrating the global search technique Sine-Cosine algorithm and local search technique Interior point algorithm. Comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to analyze numerical results. To validate solution of proposed technique, Runge-Kutta order four method isolution is taken as a reference solution. The solutions are compared graphically with the results of the reference technique. Performance indicators Mean Absolute Deviation, Root Mean Squared Error, and Error in Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency are implemented to verify consistency, and multiple independent runs are drawn. Furthermore, the scheme is evaluated through convergence graphs as well.

AB Here, we aimed to define ecological indicators of environmental change for monitoring the effect of a reintroduced species, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), over the vegetation of a natural protected area with contrasting habitats. This species was reintroduced 30 years ago in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, Spain, and its population has since grown exponentially, reaching high densities in some areas. We tested the suitability of two complementary indicators: browsing damage on woody species and the percentage of moss cover loss on rocky outcrops. For this purpose, we used a mathematical approach to zone the natural protected area according to the historical presence of the species and established five different Iberian ibex pressure classes (Classes I-V). Our results showed a direct link between Iberian ibex pressure and vegetation status. Model predictions suggested 10% moss loss in the areas with low pressure (Class I) but 64% loss in the areas with high pressure (Class III), mostly due to ungulate trampling on rocks. Similarly, browsing damage increased with increasing pressure classes for different woody species. Low palatable plant species such as Pinus spp. showed little change in browsing damage for increasing ungulate pressure whereas more palatable plants (e.g., Erica arborea) showed significantly greater browsing damage variation across pressure classes (i.e., high sensitive to herbivory pressure). Both, moss cover on rocks and widely distributed palatable woody plants proved useful ecological indicators for monitoring ungulate populations in mountainous areas with a diverse array of habitats (e.g., rocky vs. woody). This methodology may help select the most suitable indicators for each type of ecosystem or dominant habitat in ungulate-dominated ecosystems.

AB The effects of fresh and spray-dried microalgal diets on the growth, digestive enzymatic activity, and gut mi-crobial community were investigated in juveniles of the winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin. A total of 240 pearl oysters were fed either live or spray-dried unialgal diets of the species Isochrysis zhanjiangensis and Platymonas subcordiformis at a final concentration of 150,000 cells/mL. The experiment was performed over 28 days in triplicate feeding trials under laboratory conditions. At the end of the feeding trials, the hepatopancreas and gut tissue were dissected to quantify the digestive enzymatic activity and analyze the gut bacterial community. The survival rate of the oyster juveniles in all trials was > 90 %. Moreover, the animals fed a spray-dried P. subcordiformis diet exhibited slightly higher shell growth rates. However, the mean shell height and the total wet weight were not significantly different among all experimental groups (P > 0.05). The digestive en-zymes amylase, pepsin, and lipase exhibited significantly higher activity levels in oysters fed spray-dried diets than in those provided live microalgae. The different diets also provoked changes in the gut microbiota of the pearl oysters. A total of 27 phyla and 482 genera were detected within all groups examined; the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes were the dominant phyla. In general, spray-dried diets exhibited a higher number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, and Simpson and Shannon indices, implying the ability of these diets to promote high microbial biodiversity. Thus, these diets benefitted the maintenance of the intestinal micro-ecological balance and health. The study findings will help optimize intermediate culture technology and management of P. penguin juveniles.

AB The decline and extirpation of large carnivore populations can lead to cascading effects in natural ecosystems. An understanding of large carnivore population densities, distribution and dynamics is therefore critical for developing effective conservation strategies across landscapes. This is particularly important in island environments where species face increased extinction risk due to genetic isolation coupled with local losses of finite habitat. The Sri Lankan leopard Panthera pardus kotiya is one of two remaining island-living leopards on Earth and the only apex predator in Sri Lanka. Despite its iconic status in Sri Lanka, robust research on the species has been limited to only a handful of scientific studies, limiting meaningful scientific recommendations for the species' conservation and management. In this study, we conducted a single season camera trap survey in Sri Lanka's largest protected area, Wilpattu National Park (1317 km(2)), located in the country's northwest. Our objective was to estimate key ecological state variables of interest (density, abundance, sex-specific movement and spatial distribution) of this leopard subspecies. Our results indicate that Wilpattu National Park supports a density of 18 individuals/100 km(2) (posterior SD=1.5; 95% HPD interval=16-21) with a mean abundance of 144 (posterior SD=15) individual leopards and a healthy sex ratio (f:m=2.03:1). The estimated activity range for male leopards > 2 years old was 49.53 km(2) (Posterior SD=3.43; HPD interval=43.09-56.41) and for female leopards > 2 years old was 22.04 km(2) (Posterior SD=1.82; HPD interval=18.34-25.65). This density falls at the higher end of published estimates for the species anywhere in its global range, based on similar methods. Given Sri Lanka's limited size, this national park system should be considered as a critical stronghold that maintains a source population of leopards, contributing to the long-term population viability of leopards in the larger landscape.

AB Simple Summary Animals living in nests leave their nests to search for food and often use constant routes. We tested how workers of ant colonies cope with pitfall traps placed on their way to food. Such pits can represent those dug by the ant-hunting pit-building antlions. The pitfall traps delayed the arrival at the food and increased the workers' tracks, but the ants improved in searching after accumulating experience. Furthermore, workers learned to avoid falling into the pits with experience. Removing or adding pits led to a fast change in the worker behavior and they ignored the past conditions, except for tracks that were longer than expected, after pitfall traps were removed. The ants fell much more frequently into pits closer to the arena entry, suggesting that such positions are especially profitable for sit-and-wait predators, ambushing such ants. Central-place foragers, such as social insects or nesting birds, repeatedly use the same routes from and to their nests when foraging for food. Such species forage more efficiently after accumulating experience. We examined, here, a relatively neglected aspect of such an improvement with experience-the avoidance of pitfall traps. Similar pits are built by antlions, which co-occur with the ants, but they also resemble other natural obstacles. We used the desert ant Cataglyphis niger, common in sandy habitats, and allowed it to forage for three successive runs for a food reward. Ant workers discovered food more slowly and in smaller numbers when pits were in their path. Pit presence also led to longer tracks by ants and slower movement. However, with experience, the ants fell into such pits less often and reached the food more quickly. To understand how past conditions affect current behavior, we investigated whether removing or adding pits led to a different result to that with a constant number of pits. Workers adjusted their behavior immediately when conditions changed. The only carryover effect was the longer tracks crossed by workers after pit removal, possibly resulting from the mismatch between the past and current conditions. Finally, the workers were more likely to fall into pits that were closer to the nest than those that were further away. This is a good example of the advantage that ambush predators can derive from ambushing their prey in specific locations.

AB Tropical dry forests experience pronounced seasonal changes in precipitation manifested in varied plant phenologies. At landscape scales, geologic substrate-one of the least understood abiotic factors interacting with precipitation-may modulate phenological responses in these forests through a combination of mechanisms regulating water and nutrient use. We leveraged a phenological dataset from the semiarid island of Curacao to examine the extent to which plant phenology at multiple levels of biological organization diverge under different geologies. Monthly observations over a 30-month period of leaves, flowers, and fruits of 69 plant species of different life forms at three nearby sites differing in their underlaying geology were used to examine intra- and inter-annual plant responses at species, community, and system levels. The integration of leaf, flower, and fruit observations at intra-annual scales revealed diverse phenological strategies among species, broad associations with geologic substrate, and the extent of intra-specific variation as a function of geology. The community- and system-level analyses at inter-annual scales showed a reduction in mean leaf scores during the 30-month period, a weak and strong leafless period in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and differences among geologic substrates. Finally, we observed significant and positive relationships between precipitation and the phenophase scores; the strength of the relationships varied with phenophase and geologic substrate. Results of this work emphasize the importance of geologic substrate, and more broadly speaking landscape heterogeneity, in modulating plant phenological responses in tropical dry forests. Ultimately, this information will become important to understand and mitigate global climate change impacts. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB The dreams of Humboldt and many of his successors have not yet come true. Despite the great achievements of the last century, we still do not know the total number of vegetation types or the difference in the patterns of the distribution of diversity above and below the ground, we cannot predict all the effects of climate change on vegetation at the regional and global scale, we do not know the hidden and dark parts of species diversity in most ecosystems, nor are we able to make historical vegetation maps for many areas of the Earth. We also do not know the cultural contribution of many plant communities for the development of human populations and civilization, nor do we know the future recreational and therapeutical potential of vegetation (e.g., aromatherapy, ecotherapy). Geobotanical methods can effectively contribute to finding the answers to hot questions in current ecology.
   Since there are so many gaps in our geobotanical knowledge and so many young researchers still speechless with delight when looking at endless steppes, lush rainforests, tall-herbs, or colorful meadows, there is no doubt that geobotany will be a thriving and developing discipline in the future. Its driving force is the passion of researchers and admiration for the beauty of various types of vegetation and their dynamics as well as awareness of the need to protect them for generations to come.

AB Although numerous studies in aquatic organisms have linked lipid metabolism with intestinal bacterial structure, the possibility of the gut microbiota participating in the biosynthesis of beneficial long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) remains vague. We profiled the gut microbiota of the mud crab Scylla olivacea fed with either a LC-PUFA rich (FO) or a LC-PUFA-poor but C18-PUFA substrate-rich (LOCO) diet. Additionally, a diet with a similar profile as LOCO but with the inclusion of an antibiotic, oxolinic acid (LOCOAB), was also used to further demarcate the possibility of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in gut microbiota. Compared to diet FO treatment, crabs fed diet LOCO contained a higher proportion of Proteobacteria, notably two known taxonomy groups with PUFA biosynthesis capacity, Vibrio and Shewanella. Annotation of metagenomic datasets also revealed enrichment in the KEGG pathway of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and polyketide synthase-like system sequences with this diet. Intriguingly, diet LOCOAB impeded the presence of Vibrio and Shewanella and with it, the function of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. However, there was an increase in the function of short-chain fatty acid production, accompanied by a shift towards the abundance of phyla Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota. Collectively, these results exemplified bacterial communities and their corresponding PUFA biosynthesis pathways in the microbiota of an aquatic crustacean species.

AB In savanna ecosystems, fire and herbivory alter the competitive relationship between trees and grasses. Mechanistically, grazing herbivores favor trees by removing grass, which reduces tree-grass competition and limits fire. Conversely, browsing herbivores consume trees and limit their recovery from fire. Herbivore feeding decisions are in turn shaped by risk-resource trade-offs that potentially determine the spatial patterns of herbivory. Identifying the dominant mechanistic pathways by which fire and herbivores control tree cover remains challenging, but is essential for understanding savanna dynamics. We used an experiment in the Serengeti ecosystem and a simple simulation driven by experimental results to address two main aims: (1) determine the importance of direct and indirect effects of grass, fire, and herbivory on seedling establishment and (2) establish whether predators determine the spatial pattern of successful seedling establishment via effects on mesoherbivore distribution. We transplanted tree seedlings into plots with a factorial combination of grass and herbivores (present/absent) across a lion-kill-risk gradient in the Serengeti, burning half of the plots near the end of the experiment. Ungrazed grass limited tree seedling survival directly via competition, indirectly via fire, and by slowing seedling growth, which drove higher seedling mortality during fires. These effects restricted seedling establishment to below 18% and, in conjunction with browsing, resulted in seedling establishment dropping below 5%. In the absence of browsing and fire, grazing drove a 7.5-fold increase in seedling establishment. Lion predation risk had no observable impact on herbivore effects on seedling establishment. The severe negative effects of grass on seedling mortality suggests that regional patterns of tree cover and fire may overestimate the role of fire in limiting tree cover, with regular fires representing a proxy for the competitive effects of grass.

AB In order to prioritize the conservation and management efforts to protect jaguars (Panthera onca), it is of utmost importance to determine their tolerance in face of human disturbances, habitat modifications and varying degrees of prey availability. We assessed the occupancy probability of jaguars and five of their most common prey species throughout a heterogeneous landscape in the Selva Maya in southern Mexico: armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), coati (Nasua narica), paca (Cuniculus paca), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu). Additionally, we projected prey and Jaguar occupancies onto a 5993 km(2) landscape based on the habitat type in the area. We averaged the best prey models ranked by QAICc and found that white-tailed deer had the highest average occupancy probability of 0.72 +/- 0.06 and paca the lowest with 0.14 +/- 0.04. The average occupancy probability for jaguars was 0.35 +/- 0.07 and the strongest predictor of jaguar occupancy was a positive effect of collared peccary occupancy. These findings support previous studies that show that predator distribution is largely influenced by their prey availability, even in the midst of degraded habitats, and underlies the essential need to incorporate protection plans for prey species in jaguar conservation strategies.

AB Seagrasses are in decline worldwide, and their restoration is relatively expensive and unsuccessful compared to other coastal systems. Fertilization can improve seagrass growth in restoration but can also release nutrients and pollute the surrounding ecosystem. A slow-release fertilizer may reduce excessive nutrient discharge while still providing resources to the seagrass's rhizosphere. In this study, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), a relatively insoluble, sustainable compound harvested in wastewater treatment plants, was compared to Osmocote (TM) (14:14:14 Nitrogen: Phosphorus: Potassium, N:P:K), a popular polymer coated controlled release fertilizer commonly used in seagrass restoration. Two experiments compared the effectiveness of both fertilizers in a subtropical flow-through mesocosm setup. In the first experiment, single 0.5 mg of P per g dry weight (DW) doses of Osmocote (TM) and struvite fertilizers were added to seagrass plots. Seagrass shoot counts were significantly higher in plots fertilized with struvite than both the Osmocote (TM) and unfertilized controls (p < 0.0001). A significant difference in total P concentration was observed in porewater samples of Osmocote (TM) vs struvite and controls (p < 0.0001), with struvite fertilized plots emitting more than controls (p <= 0.0001), but less than 2% of the total dissolved P (TDP) of Osmocote (TM) fertilized plots (100 + mg/L versus x > 5 mg/L). A subsequent experiment, using smaller doses (0.01 and 0.025 mg of P per gram DW added), also found that the struvite treatments performed better than Osmocote (TM), with 16-114% more above ground biomass (10-60% higher total biomass) while releasing less N and P. These results indicate the relatively rapid dissolution of Osmocote (TM) may pose problems to restoration efforts, especially in concentrated doses and possibly leading to seagrass stress. In contrast, struvite may function as a slow-release fertilizer applicable in seagrass and other coastal restoration efforts.

AB A harsh environment, slow tree growth, nutrient deficiencies, and competition between trees and weeds can impede forest establishment on reclaimed lands. We investigated the effects of torrefied wood chips (TWC) and vermicompost (VC) soil amendments on the growth of Populus euramericana Guinier, weed biomass, and soil chemical properties on reclaimed land in Saemangeum. The 2.5 Mg ha(-1) and 5.0 Mg ha(-1) TWC had a similar effect on tree diameter and height growth (i.e., 2.5 = 5.0 > 0 TWC) and tended to have similar, higher effect on the total biomass of P. euramericana than the 0 Mg ha(-1). The 2.5 Mg ha(-1) TWC resulted in a significantly larger root biomass than the 5.0 Mg ha(-1) TWC. The weed biomass was significantly larger at the 2.7 Mg ha(-1) VC (i.e., 730.5-810.5 g m(-2)) than the control (605.1-610.6 g m(-2)), but VC alone was not effective for tree growth and soil amelioration. The TWC had no effect on weed biomass. Thus, the TWC and VC had contrasting effects on tree growth and weed biomass when they were used as soil amendments on salt-affected reclaimed land. VC application may promote weed proliferation, whereas TWC application may potentially increase the growth of P. euramericana and control weed growth on reclaimed lands. Our results enhance the existing knowledge on tree and weed responses to torrefied wood chips and vermicompost amendments for the sustainable management of salt-affected reclaimed lands.

AB Large river valleys (LRVs) are heterogeneous in habitat and rich in biodiversity, but they are largely overlooked in policies that prioritize conservation. Here, we aimed to identify plant diversity hotspots along LRVs based on species richness and spatial phylogenetics, evaluate current conservation effectiveness, determine gaps in the conservation networks, and offer suggestions for prioritizing conservation. We divided the study region into 50 km x 50 km grid cells and determined the distribution patterns of seed plants by studying 124,927 occurrence points belonging to 14,481 species, using different algorithms. We generated phylogenies for the plants using the "V. PhyloMaker" R package, determined spatial phylogenetics, and conducted correlation analyses between different distribution patterns and spatial phylogenetics. We evaluated the effectiveness of current conservation practices and discovered gaps of hotspots within the conservation networks. In the process, we identified 36 grid cells as hotspots (covering 10% of the total area) that contained 83.4% of the species. Fifty-eight percent of the hotspot area falls under the protection of national nature reserves (NNRs) and 83% falls under national and provincial nature reserves (NRs), with 42% of the area identified as conservation gaps of NNRs and 17% of the area as gaps of NRs. The hotspots contained high proportions of endemic and threatened species, as did conservation gaps. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the layout of current conservation networks, establish micro-nature reserves, conduct targeted conservation priority planning focused on specific plant groups, and promote conservation awareness. Our results show that the conservation of three hotspots in Southwest China, in particular, is likely to positively affect the protection of biodiversity in the LRVs, especially with the participation of the neighboring countries, India, Myanmar, and Laos.

AB Poaching and illegal trafficking are major threats to biodiversity, especially when endangered felids are concerned. Tigers are iconic animals, and there is huge demand for their body parts both in the national and international illegal markets. India forms the largest tiger conservation unit in the world and poaching is at its peak even though there are stringent laws and strict enforcement. In the present study, we analytically estimated the tiger seizure cases in India from 2001-2021 using newspaper archives as the main source of data. The data was geo-referenced to understand the details of seizure, demand, and locality. We statistically correlated the seizure rate with the density of tigers, tiger reserves, and various other socio-economic factors. Our result shows that skin, claws, bones, and teeth have more demand, with nails and teeth being the most preferred in local markets. The bones, flesh, and other parts were mostly seized in the border states of the north and eastern states. The intensity of seizures is very high in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Assam. From our analysis, we predict four trade routes for the export of the seized parts: the Nepal-Bhutan border, Assam border, the Brahmaputra, and the Mumbai port. This corresponds to the five tiger conservation blocks in India, and we observed the seizure rate is high near the Western Ghats region, which has not yet been noticed. Apart from the seizure, we are unconcerned with the seizure's origin or the local trading routes. The study demonstrates the importance of identifying the source population using DNA methods and carefully enforcing the rules in area of poaching. We assert that current approaches are incapable of resolving the issue and that a more precise and effective forensic procedure capable of resolving the issue at the minute local level is critical for precisely tracing trade channels.

AB Exploitation of insects and spiders through commercialization represents a serious threat to rare species and to common species that provide valuable ecological services. The speed, scope, and anonymity, of online commerce places full monitoring and managing of exploitation beyond the resources available to regulatory agencies. To assess the level of online commerce of insect and spider species and services and to test the feasibility of focused searches by student-specialists to generate "leads" for regulatory agencies to pursue, a group of entomology students lead by entomologists and wildlife biologists performed a directed search for sales of insect and spider species listed on CITES Appendices, the IUCN Red List, and the U.S. Endangered Species List, and species that provide services. Focused searches by student-specialists proved effective, locating sales of 79 listed species across all lists. The proportion of listed species discovered for sale varied from 2% to 55% across protected lists and the sale prices of species varied from 2 to 3850 USD. The number of listed species for sale also varied across platforms with less than 6 found on either Amazon or Alibaba and more than 30 found on Etsy and Ebay. In contrast to the listed species, numbers of insects and spiders sold to provide services can range in the billions of individuals and total sales can range in the millions USD. While all species for this purpose do provide a service, they each present unique risks to other species in their genera, guild, and to the larger ecological community, in some cases threatening ecological functions. To effectively monitor the impact of invertebrate service species, we propose incorporating these "livestock" into the existing regulatory framework used for vertebrates.

AB Environmental water requirements (EWRs) are set for South Africa's estuaries to ensure that they are maintained in a state that is both achievable and commensurate with their level of conservation and economic importance. However, these EWRs are typically determined on the basis of models and scenario analyses that require extrapolation beyond existing data and experience, especially if climate change is considered. In the case of the Berg Estuary, South Africa, available data on changes in freshwater flow and water quality span a period of at least five decades (1970s-present) during which significant reduction in flows has been observed. Monitoring data also cover an extreme 3-year drought, from 2015-2017, which provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of severe freshwater starvation (zero-flow for an extended period) on this large, permanently open system. Our analyses show that mean annual runoff (MAR) under present-day conditions has been reduced to around 50% of that under reference (natural) conditions and that reduction in runoff during the low-flow season (summer) has been more severe (80-86% reduction) than for the high-flow season (39-42% reduction). The salinity gradient now extends much further upstream than under reference conditions. Hypersaline conditions along with a reverse salinity gradient were recorded in the estuary for the first time ever during the drought of 2015/17. Levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NOx) reaching the estuary from the catchment have increased dramatically (6-7 fold) over the past five decades, dissolved reactive phosphate (PO4) slightly less so (2-3 fold), but ammonia (NH4) hardly at all. Increases in nutrient input from the catchment in the high-flow season are also much more dramatic than in the low-flow season. The estuary is no longer compliant with gazetted EWRs and requires urgent interventions to restore the quantity and quality of freshwater it receives.

AB This paper explores the resilience of the urban informal economy through multi-dimensional conflict. Karachi constituted an ideal case study for the research given the intensity and paradigmatic nature of the multi-dimensional conflict experienced in the city between 2008 and 2013. The paper applies a comparative frame in three sites (Sadar, Orangi and Lyari) to illustrate resilience of the informal economy and its role in supporting the urban poor in Karachi to survive and sometimes thrive, whilst also contributing to peaceful recovery and adaptation, albeit persistent divisions mean violence remains possible. The paper argues for greater recognition of and support for informal economies in urban policy, marking a shift away from the predominant neoliberal forms of governance that diminish the role of the state and burden already vulnerable people with the greatest risks, particularly in fragile, conflict-affected situations where half the world's poor are predicted to live by 2030.

AB Many different analyses have shown how antagonistic interactions (e.g. predation, disease, interference competition) can foster the coexistence of two species that compete for a single resource. In contrast, whether interactions with mutualist partners can similarly foster coexistence between resource competitors has been little considered. Here, we derive a mechanistic model of two plant species that compete for a single abiotic resource and that each produce nectar that supports a single shared pollinator species. In our model, plant coexistence requires three relationships: 1) one plant species must be better at utilizing the abiotic resource to produce more ovules; 2) this better resource competitor must also be more pollen-limited in the absence of the pollinator; and 3) this species must produce much less nectar, such that pollinator abundance depends primarily on nectar produced by the less pollen-limited species. Pollinators can also shape the competitive hierarchy among plant species without promoting coexistence, an influence determined by the amount of nectar produced by the entire plant assemblage that supports pollinator abundance. Our results show that patterns of pollen limitation and nectar production across competing plant species will be essential data to evaluating whether pollinators may foster the plants' coexistence.

AB Inorganic turbidity can limit light penetration in water and reduce phytoplankton photosynthesis. Anthropogenic activities such as mining can produce or augment the amount of suspended inorganic particles in water. Recent mining disasters in Brazil have released tons of mine tailings into aquatic ecosystems, with known and unknown negative consequences for aquatic life, biodiversity, and ecosystem services beyond the human and material losses. Here, we investigated the effects of inorganic turbidity on phytoplankton chlorophyll content and composition caused by sediments from two areas in Lake Batata, one natural and the other impacted by bauxite tailings. We experimentally compared the effects of different levels of turbidity (12, 50, and 300 NTU) caused by the addition of sediments from the two lake areas on a chlorophyll-a gradient (5, 15, and 25 mu g/L). Inorganic turbidity did not consistently reduce chlorophyll-a concentrations. In treatments with high chlorophyll-a, high turbidity was associated with lower chlorophyll-a concentrations at the end of the experiment. On the other hand, in low-chlorophyll treatments, high turbidity was associated with higher chlorophyll-a concentrations. In treatments with sediments from the natural area, overall chlorophyll-a levels were higher than in treatments with sediments from the impacted area. Phagotrophic algae dominated both in treatments with sediments from the impacted area (Chrysophyceae 34%, Chlorophyceae 26%, and Cyanobacteria 22% of total density) and in treatments with sediment from the natural area (Euglenophyceae 26%, Chrysophyceae 23%, and Chlorophyceae 20%). We conclude that high turbidity does not lead to a reduction in chlorophyll-a concentrations and sediment from the natural area allowed higher chlorophyll-a levels, indicating that impacted area sediment affected more phytoplankton.

AB Despite being key conservation instruments, the ecological effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) is contested. To assess the ecological effectiveness of PAs in the Katavi-Rukwa Ecosystem (KRE) in western Tanzania, we investigated temporal changes in land-use and population densities of six large mammal target species (elephant, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, topi, and hartebeest) across areas with different conservation category, ranging from unprotected to strictly protected. During six survey periods between 1991 and 2018, we analyzed data from remote sensing and aerial wildlife surveys to derive (i) spatiotemporal patterns of cropland cover in relation to protection category; (ii) population densities of the six-target species; and (iii) distribution of these species across protection category, land-use and environmental variables. During the surveyed period, cropland increased from 3.4 % to 9.6 % on unprotected land and from <= 0.05 % to <1 % on protected land. Wildlife densities of most, but not all target species declined across the entire landscape, yet the onset of the observed wildlife declines occurred several years before the onset of cropland expansion. Logistic regression models indicated that target species preferred the national park over less strictly PAs and areas distant to cropland. As our data do not support a direct link between land-use change and wildlife densities, additional factors may explain the apparent ecosystem-wide decline in wildlife. To bolster wildlife conservation in the KRE, we recommended proactive strategies to reduce direct threats to wildlife and cropland expansion toward wildlife dispersal areas and migratory corridors.

AB Like their ancestors, forest dwellers in the Republic of the Congo depend heavily on bushmeat for their livelihoods. National regulations and enforcement are ineffective, yet undermine indigenous institutions. In common with many forest communities globally, this is creating an open-access resource at the same time that demand for bushmeat is increased by roads, towns, markets and new harvesting technology (guns, wire). We argue that the intractability and contradictions of the bushmeat problem globally reflect outdated institutions of exclusionary conservation and that the disempowerment of local people can be framed as an 'empty laws' open-access syndrome in which neither national nor local controls are working. We propose that this is an institutional predicament that needs to be resolved by re-establishing local tenure and rights, and drawing on the commons literature, New Institutional Economics and the long experience with private and community wildlife in southern Africa to design alternative governance regimes. In proposing measures to re-build local commons (private-community ownership), this review highlights community rights, the controversial issue of commercial use and markets, and the substantial advantages of participatory face-to-face community governance relative to the representational committee-based governance associated with development projects.

AB The UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration signifies the ambition to move beyond a defensive focus on biodiversity protection towards a proactive agenda of restoring ecosystems to generate value for people and nature. The international nature regime, based on the linked concepts of biodiversity and sustainable development, has achieved much. However, its institutions are built on a 'compositional' approach to ecology that 'locks in' arbitrary ecological baselines and constrains an ambitious approach to ecosystem restoration. Rewilding and the wider field of restoration ecology foreground the dynamic nature of ecosystems, the need to consider system function and the importance of trophic networks for ecosystem recovery. Rewilding science extends these new directions with a focus on restoring the functional effects of large megafauna and random biotic and abiotic disturbance. I argue that historic processes of institutional reductionism, which enabled the construction of a strong protective biodiversity regime, have created institutions that lack the flexibility and innovation culture needed to create new policy and practice to support the recovery of ecosystem integrity and open-ended restoration processes such as rewilding. Given this, we need to initiate ordered and effective processes of institutional redesign. To this end, I have proposed five actions for discussion, namely: (a) adopt and embed a positive, hopeful and empowering narrative of nature recovery; (b) create 'nature recovery innovation zones', where existing policy and regulations are relaxed and new approaches are developed and tested; (c) develop functional classifications of nature to support the design of 'new generation' policy instruments; (d) create markets for ecosystem recovery based on units of ecosystem change to support the emergence of a nature recovery land economy; and (e) introduce programs of professional training in the science, principles and opportunities of ecosystem recovery at all levels in government and non-government conservation agencies. The world of 2050 will be very different from that of today. We have extremely well-educated and skilled younger generations, with the motivation and ability to redesign nature institutions. It is time to act and empower them. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB Across the globe, biological invasions have disrupted mutualisms, producing reverberating consequences for ecosystems. Although invasive species frequently trigger mutualism disruptions, few studies have quantified the demographic mechanisms by which mutualism breakdown may generate population effects. In a Kenyan savanna, the invasive big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) has disrupted a foundational mutualism between the monodominant whistling-thorn tree (Acacia drepanolobium) and native ants (Crematogaster spp.) that deter browsing by large mammalian herbivores. We conducted experiments to quantify the demographic consequences of this mutualism disruption in the presence and absence of large mammalian herbivores. Invasion by P. megacephala exacerbated population declines of A. drepanolobium, primarily through decreased survival and reproduction of adult trees. However, these fitness reductions were small compared to those resulting from the presence of large mammalian herbivores, which negatively impacted growth and survival. Contrary to expectation, the expulsion of metabolically costly Crematogaster mutualists by P. megacephala did not result in higher population growth rates for trees protected from large mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that invasive P. megacephala may impose a direct metabolic cost to trees exceeding that of native mutualists while providing no protection from browsing by large mammalian herbivores. Across landscapes, we expect that invasion by P. megacephala will reduce A. drepanolobium populations, but that the magnitude and demographic pathways of this effect will hinge on the presence and abundance of browsers.

AB The production and trade of agricultural commodities is a major driver of the loss of tropical biodiversity. In the Mid Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, which is home to many emblematic African mammals, cotton production has historically been a major driver of land cover change. The collapse of cotton production in Zimbabwe over the last decade provides a unique opportunity to understand the linkages between the profitability of cotton and land-use changes in this multifunctional landscape. By re-visiting 141 households that had been surveyed in 2007 and combining this panel survey data with a land cover analysis and secondary data, we demonstrate that the decreasing profitability of cotton led to a shift from cotton farming (mean area per farm decreasing from 1.79 +/- 2.05 ha in 2007 to 0.72 +/- 0.90 ha in 2020) to livestock farming (mean number of cattle and goats per farm increasing several-fold between 2007 and 2020), resulting in drastic land cover changes. Indeed, open vegetation (including crops, fallows and grazing areas) expanded from 10 to 20% of the total land cover area between 2007 and 2020. Populations of wildlife species have declined drastically during this period, although this cannot be attributed solely to the observed changes in land cover. However, increasing human-wildlife conflicts are likely to threaten the long-term coexistence of people and wildlife in the area. We argue that commodity crops can be an opportunity for nature conservation, not only a threat, and that conservation needs to support a `living income' for people coexisting with wildlife.

AB Seabirds are important vectors for nutrient transfer across ecosystem boundaries. In this seasonal study, we evaluate the impact of an Arctic colony (Alkhornet, Svalbard) of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) and Brunnich's Guillemots (Uria lomvia) on stream nutrient concentrations and fluxes, as well as utilization by coastal biota. Water samples from seabird-impacted and control streams were collected regularly throughout the melt season (June-September) for nutrient and organic carbon analysis. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) was used to assess whether seabird-derived nitrogen (N) could be traced into filamentous stream algae and marine algae as well as consumers (amphipods). Concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) peaked in July at 9200 mu g N L-1 in seabird-impacted streams, 70 times higher than for control streams. Mean concentrations of phosphate (PO43-) in seabird-impacted streams were 21.9 mu g P L-1, tenfold higher than in controls. Areal fluxes from seabird-impacted study catchments of NO3- + NO2- and PO43- had estimated ranges of 400-2100 kg N km(-2) and 15-70 kg P km(-2), respectively. Higher delta N-15 was found in all biota collected from seabird-impacted sites, indicating utilization of seabird-derived nitrogen. Acrosiphonia sp. from seabird-impacted sites had higher delta N-15 values (20-23 parts per thousand vs. 3-6 parts per thousand) and lower C:N ratios (10.9 vs. 14.3) than specimens collected from control sites, indicating reliance on seabird-derived nitrogen sources and potentially higher N-availability at seabird-impacted nearshore sites. Our study demonstrates how marine nutrients brought onshore by seabirds also can return to the ocean and be utilized by nearshore primary producers and consumers.

AB Woody plant encroachment has serious negative consequences for ranchers because of the reduction in herbaceous fodder for domestic livestock. A long-term monitoring of a tree-thinning experiment was established near Magudu (northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) in 1990. The objective of this experiment was to determine the optimal tree density that would maximize grass production while benefiting grasses from nitrogen fixation, hydraulic lift, and/or shade from the leguminous trees. The initial dominant species was the nitrogen-fixing tree, Dichrostachys cinerea. There were 12 plots (6 pairs) with trees removed to approximate 0, 179, 277, 428, and 625 trees ha(-1), with 1 pair left as a control (unmanipulated). One plot of each replicate (except the controls) was treated with short-acting herbicide (picloram) once in 1990. We collected data on herbaceous cover and species composition, tree species composition, sizes, and mortality. We also used remote sensing to examine the patterns of herbaceous cover. Herbaceous biomass decreased as tree density increased. After 30 yr, the same dominant tree species (D. cinerea) had reinvaded all the removal plots despite the fact that several encroaching species (Vachellia karroo, V. tortilis, V. nilotica) occurred in these plots. These D. cinerea trees were mostly less dense and contained many more juvenile individuals in the cleared and partially cleared plots than those in the control plots after 30 yr. Should maximizing herbaceous cover be the goal, repeated brush management would be necessary to maintain adequate control of woody plants in these savannas. (C) 2022 The Society for Range Management.

AB Woody encroachment in savannas represents an ecological process of current global interest given its negative impact on ecosystem functioning, particularly on forage production. Traditional savanna models propose competition and niche differentiation as the main mechanisms allowing tree-grass coexistence. Demographic models, instead, propose abiotic and biotic factors as bottlenecks controlling vital rates and transitions from seeds to adult trees. The role played by domestic grazing on woody encroachment is yet controversial. Here, using a multistage tree life approach, we combine both models and evaluate the role of grazing and herbaceous vegetation on woody recruitment in a Neotropical savanna dominated by Vachellia caven, a successful and widely spread encroacher tree species. We performed three experiments to evaluate seed predation, seedling emergence and survival of V. caven by manipulating cattle grazing (grazed and ungrazed areas) and herbaceous vegetation presence (vegetated and unvegetated). Finally, we combined the results of the three experiments to estimate the probability of plant recruitment across these experimental factors. Grazing decreased seed predation by half, did not modify seedling emergence and decreased seedling survival. Herbaceous vegetation did not affect seed predation nor seedling emergence rate, but increased seedling survival. Overall, the net effect of grazing on V. caven recruitment was neutral since the increase in seed availability due to the reduction in seed predation rate was compensated by the negative effect of grazing on seedling survival. Our analysis revealed that cattle grazing and herbaceous vegetation had contrasting effects on the seed and seedling life stages. We propose that in order to restrain the early stages of encroachment, cattle grazing pressure could be managed following the seasonality of demographic tree transitions. Through rotational grazing amongst paddocks, stocking rates could be relaxed during the primary dispersal stage to maximize granivory, and then increased to enhance the chance of seedling consumption and trampling.

AB African grassy biomes evolved together with fire and have a long history of human manipulation of fire, yet few rangeland studies acknowledge the role of prehistoric fire in shaping contemporary ecological patterns. Nevertheless, prehistoric fire records have been used elsewhere as invaluable environmental contexts for practitioners in fire management, ecosystem restoration and climate change. Therefore, our aim is to collate prehistoric sedimentary charcoal studies from southern African grassy biomes and bring them to the attention of practitioners. We discuss how long-term data contribute to fire ecology and ecosystem functioning. Importantly, this contribution aims to give a reference point for stakeholders working at different temporal and spatial scales to improve our understanding and management of grassy ecosystems.

AB Short-duration overnight kraaling has been suggested as a tool for restoring degraded rangelands. However, the response of different plant functional types and communities to such intense livestock impact may vary depending on local context. We thus examined the effects of short-duration overnight kraaling on soil and vegetation characteristics in a mesic montane grassland in South Africa using paired kraal and control sites, as part of a low intensity grazing approach. Kraaling increased soil P and S, as well as soil organic matter (except when initial values were over 12%). The effect of kraaling on vegetation was strongly dependent on initial condition. Basal cover of grasses and forbs increased by approximately 50 and 15%, respectively, if sites had very low initial basal cover, but decreased by up to 15% if initial values were over 50% and 10%, respectively. Kraaling always decreased herbaceous biomass, but especially when initial values were over 2 000 kg ha(-1). In mesic grasslands, short-duration overnight kraaling is promising as a tool for rehabilitating degraded sites or fertilizing abandoned cropland, but should be avoided where the grass sward is intact. We recommend that the suitability of kraaling be evaluated per vegetation type and local context.

AB Allelochemicals sustained-release microspheres (ACs-SMs) exhibited great inhibition effect on algae, however, few studies have focused on ACs-SMs toxicity on invertebrate. In this study, the effects of single high-concentration ACs (15 mg/L, SH-ACs), repeated low concentration ACs (3 x 5 mg/L, RL-ACs) and ACs-SMs containing 15 mg/L ACs exposure on the ingestion, incorporation, and digestion of Daphnia magna Straus (DS) were investigated by stable isotope 15 N labeling method. Meanwhile, the diversity and abundance of microflora in DS guts were determined by 16S rRNA genes and cloning methods. The results showed that SH-ACs exposure caused 50% and 33.3% death rates for newborn and adult DS, while RL-ACs exposure caused 10% death rate for newborn DS and no obvious effect on the activity of adult DS. And ACs-SMs exposure did not diminish the motility of both newborn and adult DS, indicating the lower acute toxicity of ACs-SMs. Furthermore, SH-ACs inhibited the ingestion (-6.45%), incorporation (-47.1%) and digestion (-53.8%) abilities of DS and reduced the microbial abundance (-27.7%) in DS guts. Compared with SH-ACs, RL-ACs showed relatively low impact on the ingestion (-3.23%), incorporation (-5.89%) and digestion (-23.9%) abilities of DS. Interestingly, ACs-SMs enhanced the ingestion ( + 9.68%), incorporation ( + 52.9%) and digestion ( + 51.3%) abilities of DS and increased the microbial abundance ( + 10.7%) in DS guts. Overall ACs and ACs-SMs reduced the diversity of microflora in DS guts. In conclusion, ACs-SMs can release ACs sustainably and prolong the sustained release time, which not only effectively reduce the toxicity of ACs, but also had positive effects on DS. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB Mounds of the harvester termite Coarctotermes clepsydra (Sjostedt) (Isoptera: Termitidae, Nasutitermitinae) are a typical feature of savanna woodlands in Madagascar. With densities of up to 300 termitaria ha(-1), this species provides key ecosystem services and is an important food source for wildlife. Following large-scale aerial blanket and barrier treatments with the insecticide fipronil to control an outbreak of migratory locust in the late 1990s, evidence emerged that C. clepsydra and related food webs were adversely affected. However, neither the scale nor the duration of the effects were known. The present ex post study investigated the recovery of C. clepsydra populations subjected to multiple barrier treatments against hopper bands in 1998 and 1999 at estimated cumulative dose rates of 1.7-3.4 g fipronil ha(-1). At the time of the survey in 2007, both the density of occupied termitaria (30.2 versus 106.8 mounds ha(-1)) and mound occupancy (24.3% versus 70.0%) were significantly lower in repeatedly sprayed so-called hotspots than in unsprayed areas. The overall adverse effect (mortality in sprayed areas corrected for mortality in unsprayed areas) was E = 64.4%. The main outcome of this study is a strikingly low resilience of C. clepsydra populations, which did not recover in hotspots within eight years, with likely repercussions on food webs. This study shows that the environmental benefits of barrier treatments are forfeited if the same areas are treated repeatedly during the same campaign. Recommendations are given for the mitigation of these risks.

AB Industrial farming is an alternative mode for Pinctada maxima juvenile cultivation to avoid mass mortality caused by natural disasters. Suitable and enough food is crucial for successful industrial bivalve farming. To investigate the feasibility of live microalga instead of spray-dried microalgal powder in P. maxima juvenile industrial farming, this study replaces a positive control live microalgal diet [Isochrysis zhanjiangensis (L-iso) and Platymonas subcordiformis (L-pla)] with spray-dried I. zhanjiangensis powder (P-iso) and P. subcordiformis powder (P-pla). Continuous feeding trials (30 days) were conducted on the P. maxima juvenile (1.2008 +/- 0.0009 g initial weight and 30.12 +/- 0.05 mm initial shell length), under laboratory conditions. Survival, growth performance, and intestinal microbial community were studied and compared across the groups. Results showed that survival rate (SR) did not differ significantly across the groups (ranged from 84 to 86%, P > 0.05). The growth performance in spray-dried microalgal groups, including total weight (TW), shell height (SH), absolute growth rate (AGR), and relative growth rate (RGR) for SH and TW, was slightly lower than that in live microalgal groups, while the activities of pepsin (PES), amylase (AMS), and lipase (LPS) were significantly higher (P < 0.05). The best growth performance was observed in the L-iso group, followed by the L-pla group. A 16S rRNA-based sequencing revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in P. maxima juvenile intestinal bacterial community under controlled conditions, which accounted for 62-82% across groups. The intestinal bacteria at the genus level were more sensitive to diets, whereas Burkholderia was the dominant genus in both L-iso (66.52 +/- 6.43%) and L-pla groups (54.00 +/- 5.66%), while Mycoplasma, Alphaproteobacteria, and Oxyphotobacteria were in both P-iso and P-pla groups. The P-pla group got higher ACE, Chao1, and Simpson and Shannon indices (P < 0.05). The above results suggested that the spray-dried P-iso and P-pla can serve as substitutes for live microalga in P. maxima juvenile industrial farming under controlled conditions. The finding in this study provides basic data to optimize industrial farming technology and healthy management for P. maxima juvenile.

AB Synchrony defines an organism's overlap with potential resources and mates, essential for survival and reproduction. Flowering synchrony influences gene flow within species and patterns of interaction among plants and with other trophic levels, including pollinators. Climate-change driven shifts in plant phenology may disrupt plant-plant and plant-pollinator interactions, resulting in reshuffling of communities and altered ecosystem processes. We present a unique long-term metacommunity-wide study relating changes in flowering synchrony within and among species along an elevational gradient to changes in local climatic conditions. We apply a circular statistical method that estimates flowering phenology overlap between entire flowering distributions, overcoming limitations and biases of single indicators such as first and last flowering dates. We analyzed more than 300 000 flowering overlap estimates between 217 species in five plant communities across a 1267 m gradient over four decades (1984-2019) in the southwestern USA. We show that co-flowering synchrony significantly decreased in all plant communities, with a maximum of 28.1% of synchrony lost at the lowest elevations. Decreased synchrony was significantly negatively correlated with increasing temperatures recorded across the gradient. Reduced precipitation had locally-dependent effects and, in combination with warmer temperatures, accelerated the decrease in synchrony, especially at the lowest elevations. Flowering synchrony within plant species occurring in multiple communities increased between most community pairs, with a maximum increase of 30.5%, and at accelerated rates in recent years. The exception, likely associated with differences in topography, was a 5.6% decrease in synchrony between the two highest-elevation communities. Overall, increased synchrony within species occurring at multiple elevations indicates homogenization of flowering phenology across the gradient. These results show significant reshaping of flowering synchrony within and between plant communities in response to changing climate. Because plant phenology influences many ecological processes, such fundamental changes may have far-reaching and negative effects on ecosystem stability.

AB Aquatic megafauna are difficult to observe and count due to the inaccessibility and issues of detectability. Traditional transect and helicopter counts are useful for obtaining population estimates, but they often have logistical and cost limitations. The recent proliferation of drone technology offers an innovative way of surveying animal populations. However, data collected from drones are hindered by an analysis bottleneck that increases the time needed to process them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an emerging category of deep learning that can automate this data analysis process. Here, we compare traditional methods with drone surveys, by detecting and counting Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) and common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious). We evaluate the utility of CNNs for object detection and quantification in complex environments. Drone counts were more accurate than traditional methods; identifying 21% more crocodiles. Where vegetation was open, hippo counts with a drone showed a similar pattern (identifying 43% more). When vegetation was dense the drone produced less-accurate population estimates than traditional methods. CNN accuracy was limited (85%) due to the reduced training dataset available for the CNN. However, with an expanded data set, object detection is likely to be more accurate, making it more applicable for expedited and automated data analysis.

AB Nile Crocodiles, Crocodylus niloticus, are widespread along the riverine systems and wetlands of East Africa, and may locally be involved into serious conflicts with local human communities. A research study was conducted to investigate Human-Crocodiles Conflicts (HCC) and its impacts on lives and livelihoods of local communities in the Sudd Wetlands in South Sudan (East Africa). The methodology involved face-to-face interviews and structured questionnaire to fishers and other persons from riverine communities. The questionnaire focused on (i) numbers of attacks by Nile Crocodiles on humans and livestock, (ii) months of attacks, (iii) locations of attacks, and (iv) activity of victims at the time of attacks, from 2018 to 2020. The majority of the interviewees responded that Nile Crocodiles do represent a serious threat to their lives: a total of 23 persons were attacked and killed by crocodiles between 2018 and 2020, with 100% of the attacks to humans being fatal. In addition, 166 heads of livestock were killed during the same period, and a total of 355 livestock were attacked (most of them escaped the attack). The present study revealed that the peak season of attacks by crocodiles was the dry season (October - March), and that there is urgent need of environmental education and awareness for local riverine communities in order to minimize the intensity of the HCC in South Sudan.

AB Background: Spatial patterns related to richness and endemism of Mexican ferns and lycophytes are not well known, particularly in highly biodiverse areas; among these, Oaxaca is considered a highly biodiverse Mexican state. Questions: Where are located the centers of richness and endemism of lycophytes and ferns in Oaxaca? Both groups of plants support the idea of beta-diverse state condition for Oaxaca? Study site and research period: The study includes all territory of Oaxaca, between 2015 and 2019. Methods: We analyzed the species distribution using grid cells of 20' x 20' of latitude and longitude as study units. For this, we applied species richness, endemism indexes (weighted endemism and corrected weighted endemism), and components of biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma), associated with a complementarity index. The distributional data of the species were mainly obtained from herbarium specimens. Results: The richness areas are concentrated in the Sierra Norte and Istmo regions. Three important areas in richness and endemic species are suggested from the endemism indexes. Most of the grid-cell combinations resulted in high values from the complementarity analysis suggesting a high species turnover. Conclusions: The diversity analyses suggested that Oaxaca is a beta-diverse state. The NOM-059 needs a serious, urgent, and critical revision for ferns and different biological groups. The Areas Voluntarily Designated for Conservation in Oaxaca play a major role in relation to Natural Protected Areas for conservation of ferns and lycophytes.

AB Correct timing of phenology is crucial for the survival and growth of species in arid areas with long dry seasons. Nevertheless, knowledge on genetic variation and adaptive patterns in phenology in deciduous African dryland species is limited. Here we study the variation in phenology of diploid and polypoid A. senegal trees from rangewide populations growing in a common garden trial in Senegal and test correlations between population phenology and climate at the site of origin. The leafing, flowering and fruiting phenology was monitored during 17 months and compared to detailed observations of the rainfall in the common garden during the period. We found that A. senegal trees in general started development of leaves prior to the beginning of the rainy season with flowering and fruiting initiation occurring during the rainy season. The results lead us to conclude that is was not the rain per se that initiated leaf development. We also conclude that phenology in A. senegal is under genetic control, because significant differences could be observed among populations and ploidy levels when grown at the same site. In general, early leaf flushing trees had a longer growing period and performed better in terms of growth at the tested site and the results thus support that leaf phenology influence fitness. We further found that differences among trees in phenology seem to be associated with differences in climate at their site of origin, because the timing of leaf development in the common garden and the timing of the rainy season at the site of origin was significantly correlated for the diploid trees (not for tetraploids). However, it was diploid trees from sites with a late arriving rainy season that developed leaves earliest in the year. The environmental cues that control leafing phenology and the associated physiological mechanisms therefore still need to be identified in order to understand how the variation among populations has evolved, its relationship to local adaptation and the implication for smart transfer of seed sources as mean to mitigate changing growing conditions related to global warming.

AB Benefit-sharing has been instrumental in empowering local communities living on the edge of protected areas to engage in natural resource management and enhance biodiversity conservation outcomes. Tanzania has various categories of protected area managed by six main conservation institutions, each with different types of benefit-sharing mechanisms. To investigate the acceptability of these mechanisms among local communities living in proximity to protected areas and their effectiveness at delivering benefits, we undertook a systematic review of > 1000 peer reviewed articles related to the topic published between January 1990 and February 2021. The 71 publications that met our selection criteria covered all the main categories of protected area in Tanzania. Benefit-sharing mechanisms took three forms: i. social services provision; ii. livelihood provision; and iii. employment for local people. About half the studies (48%) indicated that local people accepted or strongly accepted the benefits provided by conservation institutions in Tanzania with the level of community acceptance linked strongly with the history of engagement between communities and the conservation institutions while 40% of the reviewed studies indicated the negative views. We recommend that future research explores the values and demand for benefits among local people living close to protected areas, particularly in disaffected communities, to ensure benefit-sharing mechanisms deliver desirable socio-economic outcomes for local communities as well as conservation outcomes.

AB Under-canopy natural regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand is able to create stands with a complex structure, which are characterised by greater resistance to extreme phenomena related to climate change. The main aim of the work was to analyse the potential of pine undergrowth, its role in the stand, and its usefulness in further breeding plans to create stands of various structure, with greater stability and tolerance to stress factors, including greater resistance to climate change. The study was carried out in north-eastern Poland, in pine stands thinned by strong (hurricane level) wind in 2002. The study area covers 225.2 ha and is located in 29 stands. Naturally regenerated pine saplings with a minimum height of 0.5 m, characterised by a high density, growing under the upper cover of the stand, with varying degrees of thinning, were qualified for the study. On average 7.820 pine saplings were recorded in the area of one hectare. Over 65% of the examined saplings were determined to be of very good or good quality, prognostic for further development and the creation of the main stand in the future. The principle of increasing the structural diversity of stands is the method of increasing the adaptability of forests to environmental changes.

Planting trees in pastures ('silvopasture' or 'silvopastoral systems') is a novel approach that has the potential to increase the sustainability of cattle production in the Amazon. Trees provide additional feed whilst also enhancing biodiversity, capturing carbon and improving soil quality. We measured the potential contribution of tree forage to pasture-fed cattle at a trial farm in Peru. Three leguminous tree species (Erythrina berteroana, Inga edulis and Leucaena leucocephala) were planted with grass, and their productivity was compared to plots containing only grass. We compared destructive and non-destructive methodologies that estimated intake of tree forage by browsing cattle. We found that fresh tree foliage of the three tree species was palatable to cattle and could be directly browsed. Cattle mostly foraged below 1.6 m and consumed 99% of available foliage from E. berteroana, 75% of available forage from I. edulis and 80% of available forage from L. leucocephala. Plots containing trees and grass produced more forage biomass (mean > 2.2 Mg ha(-1)) than grass only plots (mean = 1.5 Mg ha(-1)). This research highlights the potential for sustainable intensification of livestock production in the Amazon. Assessing the palatability of forage from locally adapted trees could improve the sustainability of livestock production systems. However, grasses continue to dominate livestock feed across the Amazon. We established a silvopastoral cattle farming system in Peru, comparing three different forage tree species with grass monocultures using a randomised block design. Trees were arranged in alleys of 0.5 x 7.5 m, planted alongside grass, and were directly browsed by cattle. Browse removal was estimated by three methods: destructive sampling, canopy measurements and leaf counts. We found that all three tree species were palatable to cattle. Plots containing trees and grass produced more available forage (mean > 2.2 Mg ha(-1)) for cattle than the grass monocultures (mean = 1.5 Mg ha(-1)). Destructive sampling below 1.6 m demonstrated that cattle consumed 99% of the available Erythrina berteroana forage, 75% of the available Inga edulis forage and 80% of the available Leucaena leucocephala forage in 8 days. This research demonstrates methodologies to estimate the intake of locally adapted browse species by cattle and highlights the potential benefits of silvopastoral systems in the Amazon. Planting trees could also benefit animal health and provide ecosystem services such as soil regeneration, enhanced nutrient cycling and carbon capture.

AB In the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (central Spain), the population of Iberian wild goat, also known as Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) has grown strongly since its reintroduction three decades ago. The plant community is now under heavy browsing pressure due to this high population. A study of the presence of moss on rocks was used herein as the basis for the design of an indicator, named impact on mosses (im), to describe the environmental pressure exerted by the Iberian wild goat in terms of moss removal. Granite and gneiss zones at medium altitudes with continental Mediterranean climate are the most suitable areas for successful application of the indicator. The hypotheses to test are: (1) the indicator will discriminate between areas with different wild goat pressure levels, (2) wild goat pressure will explain a high proportion of moss loss variance, and (3) the im indicator will be useful to establish a mathematical model between wild goat pressure and moss loss. The proposed indicator was analyzed using both statistical and data science techniques. The results support the mentioned hypotheses. Specifically, statistically significant differences were found regarding the impact on mosses between areas with different levels of Iberian wild goat pressure. Thus, a high proportion of the variance was associated with wild goat pressure (80% for high-pressure areas, 56% for low-pressure areas). A modified parabolic function was fit to express the relationship between Iberian wild goat pressure and impact on mosses. In conclusion, the im indicator was shown to be a useful tool to assess pressure due to Iberian wild goat. Therefore, im can help assess and manage Iberian wild goat populations and determine their sustainable levels.

AB Tigriopus kingsejongensis, a copepod species reported from the King Sejong Station, Antarctica, serves as a valuable food resource in ecosystems. We cultured T. kingsejongensis at three different temperatures (2 degrees C, 8 degrees C, and 15 degrees C) in a laboratory to observe the changes in its fecal pellet microbiome depending on the cultivation temperatures and developmental stages. We observed that the fecal pellet microbiome of the copepod changed with temperature: a lower microbial diversity, higher abundance of the aquatic bacterium Vibrio, and lower abundance of the psychrophilic bacterium Colwellia were noted at higher temperatures. In addition, the fecal pellet microbiome of the copepod changed according to the developmental stage: a lower microbial diversity was noted in egg-attached copepods than in nauplii at 8 degrees C. We further analyzed three shotgun metagenomes from the fecal pellet samples of T. kingsejongensis at different temperatures and obtained 44 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We noted that MAGs of V. splendidus D contained glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) encoding chitinases and virulence factors at a higher relative abundance at 15 degrees C than at lower temperatures. These results indicate that increasing temperature affects the fecal pellet microbiome and the development of copepods. The findings are helpful to understand the changes in cold-adapted copepods and the effect of temperature on their growth.

AB Herbivores shape vegetation by suppressing certain plant species while benefitting others. By thus modifying plant species functional composition, herbivores affect carbon cycling, albedo, vegetation structure and species' interactions. These effects have been suggested to be able to counteract the effects of increasing temperatures on vegetation in alpine environments. Managing the dominant large ungulates in these ecosystems could thus provide a tool to mitigate climate change effects. However, it is possible that legacy effects of past grazing will dampen ungulate impacts on vegetation. We shed a light on this topic by investigating the short- and long-term effects of varying sheep densities on the plant trait composition in the Norwegian alpine tundra with centuries-long of intensive grazing history. In the first part of our study, we quantified the effects of sheep on the plant community functional trait composition at different elevations and under moderate and low productivity in. We combined data from two long-term (14 and 19 yr) sheep fence experiments and showed that differences in sheep densities did not affect plant trait composition, irrespective of productivity. However, in the second part of our study, we showed that the plant trait composition in mainland (that has been grazed for centuries) differed from vegetation on islands which have been herbivore-free. Taken together, these results suggest that sheep have an effect on the alpine plant communities on historical time scales covering centuries, but that the resulting sheep grazing resistant/tolerant communities may not respond to shorter-term (14 and 19 yr) changes in sheep densities, that is, at temporal scales relevant for ecosystem management. Furthermore, we showed that the plant trait composition at the site with low productivity had gone through a temporal trait change independent of sheep treatment, potentially due to increased temperatures and precipitation, suggesting that sheep may not be able to counteract climatic impacts in the areas with centuries-long grazing history.

AB Coastal dunes of the southern Buenos Aires province, in Argentina, are one of the last remnants of biodiversity in the southern Pampa unit, within the Rio de la Plata Grasslands. While the direct loss of grasslands due to the advance of cities and afforestation is conspicuous, the negative effects of the subdivision of the remaining environments on biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics are less considered. Our work aimed to analyze the combined effect of fires and subdivision of grasslands by invasive alien trees. Our results suggest that fragmentation affects the resilience of coastal grasslands after fire and affects the course of succession, promoting the establishment of invasive alien plants. We also suggest that fires favor the advance of pines and acacias towards the interior of grassland remnants, further reducing their area. The effective conservation of the components of Pampas biodiversity that still persist in these coastal ecosystems will depend on preventing, mitigating and compensating the insularization effects associated with forest plantations and the expansion of invasive trees, by means of adequate territorial planning that allows remnants to be maintained in a good state of conservation.

AB Chronic exposure to pollutants affects natural populations, creating specific molecular and biochemical signatures. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure to pollutants might have substantial effects on the Manila clam hologenome long after removal from contaminated sites. To reach this goal, a highly integrative approach was implemented, combining transcriptome, genetic and microbiota analyses with the evaluation of biochemical and histological profiles of the edible Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, as it was transplanted for 6 months from the polluted area of Porto Marghera (PM) to the clean area of Chioggia (Venice lagoon, Italy). One month post-transplantation, PM clams showed several modifications to its resident microbiota, including an overrepresentation of the opportunistic pathogen Arcobacter spp. This may be related to the upregulation of several immune genes in the PM clams, potentially representing a host response to the increased abundance of deleterious bacteria. Six months after transplantation, PM clams demonstrated a lower ability to respond to environmental/physiological stressors related to the summer season, and the hepatopancreas-associated microbiota still showed different compositions among PM and CH clams. This study confirms that different stressors have predictable effects in clams at different biological levels and demonstrates that chronic exposure to pollutants leads to long-lasting effects on the animal hologenome. In addition, no genetic differentiation between samples from the two areas was detected, confirming that PM and CH clams belong to a single population. Overall, the obtained responses were largely reversible and potentially related to phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic adaptation. The results here presented will be functional for the assessment of the environmental risk imposed by chemicals on an economically important bivalve species.

AB It has been proposed that harsh environments can apply pressure on organisms to evolve cooperative behaviors. We find that cooperation is the only strategy that survives the harshest of environments and that humans opt for riskier, more cooperative strategies when their energy supply is depleted. Together the results show the significant role environmental harshness plays in human cooperative dynamics and the species-unique cognition designed to support it.
   It has been proposed that environmental stress acted as a selection pressure on the evolution of human cooperation. Through agent-based evolutionary modelling, mathematical analysis, and human experimental data we illuminate the mechanisms by which the environment influences cooperative success and decision making in a Stag Hunt game. The modelling and mathematical results show that only cooperative foraging phenotypes survive the harshest of environments but pay a penalty for miscoordination in favourable environments. When agents are allowed to coordinate their hunting intentions by communicating, cooperative phenotypes outcompete those who pursue individual strategies in almost all environmental and payoff scenarios examined. Data from human participants show flexible decision-making in face of cooperative uncertainty, favouring high-risk, high-reward strategy when environments are harsher and starvation is imminent. Converging lines of evidence from the three approaches indicate a significant role for environmental variability in human cooperative dynamics and the species-unique cognition designed to support it.

AB Suspension-feeding bivalves are critical members of aquatic ecosystems worldwide, which is why research into their host-associated microbiota is growing. Experiments that artificially diminish the native microbial communities of bivalves in vivo will be increasingly necessary to evaluate the functional role of microbes within their hosts. Previous methods to manipulate the microbiome of bivalves lack standardization and, often, verification of successful disturbance. The goal of this study was to evaluate antibiotic administration as a method for perturbing the gut microbiome of bivalves in two separate, but related, experiments. In the first, a mixture of antibiotics was delivered to eastern oysters for 4 days to probe effects on gut microbial carbon usage, diversity, and taxonomic composition. In the second, the same antibiotic mixture was administered to blue mussels for 21 days to probe effects on microbial abundance, diversity, and taxonomic composition. In both experiments, animals were administered antibiotics in isolation, and stringent sterilization methods were employed, which included sterilized seawater and microalgal food. The results of the oyster experiment revealed that antibiotics substantially reduced microbial carbon usage and perturbed community composition. In the mussel experiment, antibiotics lowered microbial abundance and species richness and significantly altered community composition. Taken together, results from the two experiments demonstrate that antibiotics can be used to effectively alter the function and composition of the gut microbial community of bivalves. Future research that aims to perturb the microbiomes of suspension-feeding animals should incorporate aspects similar to the protocols described herein. Additionally, future studies must include verification, ideally high-throughput DNA sequencing coupled with microbial quantification, that the antibiotic perturbation was successful.

AB The planktonic larvae of many coastal marine invertebrates swim vertically during dispersal to exploit variation in current strength and direction, food abundance and mortality rate throughout the water column and offshore. Prior studies have estimated the effects of vertical swimming upon larval dispersal using mathematical models. However, most such studies consider just a small number of predefined swimming behaviors despite evidence that even seemingly insignificant changes to these behaviors can dramatically alter predictions of larval delivery. Additionally, the concurrent effects of vertical swimming upon predation risk, feeding opportunities and energy budgeting are not well characterized. We used a simple mathematical model of larval dispersal in upwelling-favorable conditions to investigate how a continuum of swimming behaviors affect these quantities simultaneously. Within this continuum, we identified two categories of successful behaviors. 'Mean-onshore' behaviors deliver most larvae to coastal habitats, but offer limited opportunities for feeding and alongshore movement during dispersal. By contrast, 'mean-offshore' behaviors deliver fewer larvae to shore, but permit more feeding, alongshore movement, and, potentially, safety from nearshore hazards. No behaviors considered achieved the benefits of both categories. We hypothesize that mean-onshore behaviors are advantageous for species with non-feeding larvae or sparse adult populations, while mean-offshore behaviors are advantageous for species with feeding larvae or crowded adult populations. Our results underscore the importance of considering how behavior interacts with environmental structure and individual biology while studying dispersal in marine and other ecosystems.

AB We present a program that simulates the coevolution of digital organisms competing for limited resources. The rules of competition and collaboration implicit in the code have been inspired by the underlying mechanisms that generate natural selection. The simplest, most general, and least controversial rules presented in natural systems have been chosen, and these rules have been implemented in the most flexible and adaptable way found. Our model is capable of (i) measuring the evolutionarily stable equilibrium or the unstable imbalance of biological interactions, (ii) weighing biological competition and cooperation relationships to evaluate their relative incidence in the coevolution of species, (iii) verifying widely contrasted evolutionary theories with this instrument, and (iv) shedding light on the evolutionary effects of other mechanisms, such as the spatial distribution of populations, that have not been studied in depth before.
   This paper presents an Evolutionary Cellular Automaton (ECA) that simulates the evolutionary dynamics of biological interactions by manipulating strategies of dispersion and associations between digital organisms. The parameterization of the different types of interaction and distribution strategies using configuration files generates easily interpretable results. In that respect, ECA is an effective instrument for measuring the effects of relative adaptive advantages and a good resource for studying natural selection. Although ECA works effectively in obtaining the expected results from most well-known biological interactions, some unexpected effects were observed. For example, organisms uniformly distributed in fragmented habitats do not favor eusociality, and mutualism evolved from parasitism simply by varying phenotypic flexibility. Finally, we have verified that natural selection represents a cost for the emergence of sex by destabilizing the stable evolutionary strategy of the 1:1 sex ratio after generating randomly different distributions in each generation.

AB This study examines the soil bacterial diversity in the Portulacaria afra-dominated succulent thicket vegetation of the Albany Subtropical Thicket biome; this biome is endemic to South Africa. The aim of the study was to compare the soil microbiomes between intact and degraded zones in the succulent thicket and identify environmental factors which could explain the community compositions. Bacterial diversity, using 16S amplicon sequencing, and soil physicochemistry were compared across three zones: intact (undisturbed and vegetated), degraded (near complete removal of vegetation due to browsing) and restored (a previously degraded area which was replanted approximately 11 years before sampling). Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) richness was similar across the three zones, however, the bacterial community composition and soil physicochemistry differed across the intact and degraded zones. We identified, via correlation, the potential drivers of microbial community composition as soil density, pH and the ratio of Ca to Mg. The restored zone was intermediate between the intact and degraded zones. The differences in the microbial communities appeared to be driven by the presence of plants, with plant-associated taxa more common in the intact zone. The dominant taxa in the degraded zone were cosmopolitan organisms, that have been reported globally in a wide variety of habitats. This study provides baseline information on the changes of the soil bacterial community of a spatially restricted and threatened biome. It also provides a starting point for further studies on community composition and function concerning the restoration of degraded succulent thicket ecosystems.

AB Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) is a noxious, annual invasive herb prevalent in more than 50 countries worldwide. In South Africa, the weed is a highly damaging invasive species, particularly in savanna regions, threatening food security, native biodiversity, livelihoods and human health. Given the multitude of threats posed by P. hysterophorus, this study aimed to determine the influence of the invasion of P. hysterophorus and its associated seedbank dynamics at a small spatial scale. To assess this, two neighbouring savanna reserves, with differing stocking densities (i.e. over-and understocked), were selected and assessed seasonally over a four-year period. Overstocking exacerbated the invasion of P. hysterophorus, with greater densities, larger plants and increased seed production, at a plot level. This enhanced invasion was also reflected in changes to the site's above-ground plant community, with significantly lower species richness, evenness, and diversity. Parthenium hysterophorus comprised more than 80% of the overstocked reserve's seedbank, and was responsible for continued declines in the richness, evenness and diversity of species below-ground. Whereas P. hysterophorus at the understocked reserve, occupied a smaller proportion of the seedbank (>> 70%), with richness, evenness and diversity all showing signs of recovery over the four-year period. Overall, this research highlighted the impacts of P. hysterophorus in South Africa, as well as the potential role grazing management has in limiting or facilitating P. hysterophorus invasions and their impacts within savannas.

AB BackgroundReproduction in most flowering plants may be limited because of the decreased visitation or activity of pollinators in fragmented habitats. Hedysarum scoparium Fisch. et Mey. is an arid region shrub with ecological importance. We explored the pollen limitation and seed set of Hedysarum scoparium in fragmented and restored environments, and examined whether pollen limitation is a significant limiting factor for seed set. We also compared floral traits and pollinator visitation between both habitats, and we determined the difference of floral traits and pollinators influenced reproductive success in Hedysarum scoparium.ResultsOur results indicated that supplementation with pollen significantly increased seed set per flower, which is pollen-limited in this species. Furthermore, there was greater seed set of the hand cross-pollination group in the restored habitat compared to the fragmented environment. More visits by Apis mellifera were recorded in the restored habitats, which may explain the difference in seed production between the fragmented and restored habitats.ConclusionsIn this study, a positive association between pollinator visitation frequency and open flower number was observed. The findings of this study are important for experimentally quantifying the effects of floral traits and pollinators on plant reproductive success in different habitats.

AB Ecological interactions among multiple invaders can aggravate their effects on invaded systems. Many salmonids including rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha have established naturalized populations and co-occur in rivers worldwide. Predation of eggs and juveniles has been well documented among salmonids in their native range in the Northern Hemisphere. It has been unclear to what extent these interactions exist in invaded rivers of the Patagonia. Here, we report and quantify rainbow trout predation of Chinook salmon eggs in the Cisnes River Basin, southern Chile. We used hook and line angling to sample rainbow trout (n = 80) around salmon spawning areas before, during, and after the spawning season of Chinook salmon. Stomach contents obtained during two consecutive years show consistent evidence that rainbow trout opportunistically prey on Chinook salmon eggs. Salmon eggs occurred in 75 and 50% of the trout stomachs analyzed in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The number of salmon eggs (mean +/- SD) per trout stomach ranged between 17.95 +/- 24.29 in 2019 and 7.45 +/- 12.90 in 2020. We assumed that consumed eggs were primarily non-viable or would have had low probabilities of survival suggesting a synergistic interaction between rainbow trout and Chinook salmon. Our findings provide baseline information that contribute to demographic studies and the management of invasive salmonids in rivers of this region and elsewhere.

AB The prevailing methodology of noncontinuous wildlife market surveys contributes little to our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of markets and their supply. Here, we investigate trends in bird trade in a large regional domestic market. Near-continuous monthly surveys at a pet market in Guangzhou, China discovered over 95,000 individuals of 147 species between 2011 and 2013. We analyzed optimal survey frequency, finding that autumn is the best season to detect maximal species diversity. In a mixed-effects model, we found that species-specific purposes for trade controls the occurrence of species across shops in a market. A buffer analysis showed that 13 of the 15 most abundant species are distributed within 200 km of the market. However, hotspots of range overlap for wild-caught, native species were found at great distances from the market within China and along China's borders. Identifying the location of theoretical trapping bottlenecks (areas where trapping levels are high) from this market data can help identify regions (e.g., southwest China) that are affected by trade, where local bird populations may be experiencing residual impacts from harvesting. Our results provide insights to improve methodologies for monitoring wildlife markets and identify priority regions for population surveys of in-demand wild bird species.

AB Resilience is a system's ability to maintain its function when perturbations and errors occur. Whilst we understand low-dimensional networked systems's behavior well, our understanding of systems consisting of a large number of components is limited. Recent research in predicting the network level resilience pattern has advanced our understanding of the coupling relationship between global network topology and local nonlinear component dynamics. However, when there is uncertainty in the model parameters, our understanding of how this translates to uncertainty in resilience is unclear for a large-scale networked system. Here we develop a polynomial chaos expansion method to estimate the resilience for a wide range of uncertainty distributions. By applying this method to case studies, we not only reveal the general resilience distribution with respect to the topology and dynamics submodels but also identify critical aspects to inform better monitoring to reduce uncertainty.

AB Nile crocodile survival is threatened by water pollution, habitat loss, extensive water abstraction for irrigation, domestic use and industrial development and overexploitation of fisheries resources in water systems in Zimbabwe. This review assessed the abundance, distribution and population trends of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus Laurent, 1768), and explored the effects of ranching, trophy hunting and human-crocodile conflicts (HCC) on its conservation status in water systems of Zimbabwe. Scoping reviews of available literature and analysis of recurrent themes indicated that crocodile censuses were concentrated in the warmer northern and southern parts of the country. Ranching and trophy hunting have contributed to the increases in crocodile populations. Human encroachment and wetland degradation have increased HCC in fringe communities proximate to protected areas consequently inducing negative perceptions and hurtrage which threatens crocodile populations. Overall, there is an increase in crocodile populations in sampled areas. Nonetheless, there is a need to assess the abundance, distribution and population trends, and delineate hotspots of suitable habitats and contextual challenges in less sampled areas before stating the national crocodile population estimate. Implementing astute crocodile conservation efforts involving locals is key in HCC mitigation. However, it implores the need for development of pro human-crocodile co-existence and circumstantial HCC resolution policies. For posterity, the conservation status of crocodiles in Zimbabwe should be ascribed as Vulnerable or Near Threatened rather than the current Least Concern or Low Risk status.

AB Restoration of degraded subtropical succulent thicket, via the planting of Portulacaria afra (spekboom) truncheons, is the focus of a public works programme funded by the South African government. The goals of the programme, which started in 2004, are to create jobs, sequester carbon, restore biodiversity, reduce erosion, improve soil water holding capacity and catalyse private sector investment for upscaling of restoration. Here we report on a region-wide experiment to identify factors that can improve project success. Measures of success were survivorship and annual aboveground biomass carbon sequestration (ABCsr) of spekboom truncheons some 33-57 months after planting-starting in March 2008-into 173 fenced plots (0.25 ha) located throughout the global extent of spekboom thicket vegetation. We also collected data for 18 explanatory variables under the control of managers, and an additional 39 variables reflecting soil physical and chemical characteristics and rainfall patterns post restoration, all beyond the influence of managers. Since the latter covariates were available for only 83 plots, we analysed the two data sets separately. We used a prediction rule ensemble to determine the most important predictors of restoration success. There was great variation in percentage survivorship (median = 24, range = 0-100%) and ABCsr (median = 0.009, range = 0-0.38 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)). The model using management variables explained less variance (53%) in survivorship than the model incorporating additional soil and rainfall covariates (62%). ABCsr models were better fits (78 and 88% variance explained, respectively). All model configurations identified browse intensity as a highly influential predictor of restoration success. Predicted success was highest for plots located in target habitat; however, only 45% were thus located, suggesting the need for expert input and habitat modelling for improving target habitat identification. Frost exposure was another important predictor influencing all models but was likely a consequence of locating sites off target habitat. Sites planted on equatorward slopes during the warm season showed reduced carbon sequestration, possibly due to elevated soil moisture stress associated with high radiation loads. Physiographic factors associated with improved restoration success were location on sloping ground (reduced frost exposure), increasing longitude (more warm-season rainfall) and increasing latitude (less frost coastwards). Few trends were evident among post-restoration climatic factors beyond the control of managers. Higher rainfall during the year post restoration had a negative impact on carbon sequestration while higher rain during the early months post restoration had a positive effect on both carbon sequestration and survivorship. Soil factors showed little importance for the survivorship model, whereas silt content, % K and Mg CEC emerged as predictors of carbon sequestration. Our results have direct relevance for improving the success of landscape-scale restoration projects envisioned for the ca. 8,930 km(2) of degraded spekboom thicket.

AB Communities can be described by species, interactions and the network of interactions which emerge from these building blocks. Networks are often summarized by diverse metrics which capture key components of network topology, for example, number of trophic levels, number of interactions per species (i.e. degree) and frequency of apparent competition modules (i.e. motifs). Network metrics are often used to predict whole community responses following a perturbation. Understanding whether our predictive capabilities at the network level are maintained at other levels of organization such as species and interaction levels is critical but rarely studied. Our objective was to determine whether we can use different network metrics (e.g. modularity, species roles) to predict which networks, species and interactions will persist following a perturbation. Given the nested structure of interactions, species and networks, we hypothesized that those metrics which were correlated with network persistence would be the same metrics correlated with which species and interactions persist and that the direction of these correlations would be maintained across organizational levels (i.e. network, species and interactions). We used numerical simulations of a dynamic food web model and model selection to test the relationships between network metrics (e.g. degree, modularity, motif profiles) and network, species and interaction-level persistence. We found that out degree and frequency of both apparent and exploitative competition were the best predictors of species persistence, however all metrics were weak predictors of species persistence. This demonstrates that metrics which predict network persistence are not always the best predictors of species and interaction level persistence. Additionally, metrics can work in opposition depending on the organizational scope examined; for example interaction strength is positively correlated with interaction persistence, but negatively correlated with species persistence. Multiscale analysis of network metrics such as this one, may provide critical insight for advancing network-based environmental management in the Anthropocene.

AB Proterochampsids were a group of stem archosaurs from the Middle-Late Triassic of South America. Using for the first time in proterochampsids quantitative microanatomical and morphological data and an inference model, we analyze the microstructure of postcranial bones of proterochampsids to infer life-history traits dealing with growth dynamics, ontogenetic changes, dermal armor histogenesis and lifestyle. We studied proterochampsid individuals from the Middle-Late Triassic Chanares Formation: three specimens of Chanaresuchus bonapartei: PVL 4575 (osteoderms and femur), CRILAR-Pv 80 (osteoderm) and CRILAR-Pv 81 (humerus), and a femur of a non-identified Rhadinosuchinae specimen (CRILAR-Pv 488). The osteoderms show a compact-uniform composition of parallel-fibered bone and lines of arrested growth (LAGs). The long bones are composed mainly of highly vascularized, parallel-fibered bone and isolated areas of woven-fibered bone in the innermost portion of cortex (only in C. bonapartei PVL 4575). The absence of an external fundamental system (EFS) indicates that all of the sampled individuals were somatically immature at time of death. The absence of mineralized bundles of collagenous fibers supports intramembranous ossification as the developmental origin for the osteoderms. With an inference model used for the first time in proterochampsids, the lifestyle inferred for C. bonapartei is terrestrial. Histological evidence indicates that sexual maturity is reached before both somatic and skeletal maturity. The growth patterns among proterochampsids exhibit some degree of variation even within a single species. Such variation can be due to different causes, including possibly phenotypic plasticity.

AB It is hypothesized that in the Holocene dune fynbos-thicket mosaics of the Cape, decades-long absence of fire results in closed-canopy thicket replacing more open fynbos shrublands. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing repeat photographs from 16 sites at Cape St Francis in the south-eastern Cape Floristic Region. The period of monitoring ranged from 55 to 17 year and most sites had been last burnt between 30 and 50 years ago. We divided the sites into coastal (salt wind-exposed) and inland zones and computed, for each pair of photographs, the rate of change of four plant types, namely thicket shrubs, fynbos woody, fynbos herbaceous and grass. Coastal zone sites showed a significant increase in thicket shrub cover and a significant decline in both grass and fynbos herbaceous cover. Fynbos woody cover declined in the face of thicket invasion, but increased in grassy sites, most likely due to a decline in herbivory intensity. No significant changes in plant types were observed in the inland sites, although thicket shrub cover did increase marginally at the expense of fynbos woody plants. However, thicket invasion was restricted to swales and lower dune slopes; the dune fynbos of the upper slopes and crests remains uninvaded by thicket and surprisingly vigorous after 30 similar to 50 year without fire. This is consistent with the notion that fynbos species occupy drier sites than thicket in these dune landscapes and regular fire is not a prerequisite for its persistence. Overall, we showed a large increase in woody plant cover throughout the study area. While this pattern is consistent with predictions for vegetation change in response to atmospheric [CO2] pollution, it can also be explained by land use changes experienced in the study area, starting in the early 1960s, involving a shift from subsistence agriculture to holiday resort development and tourism.

AB Hurricanes threaten drinking water supplies in Florida through problems such as contamination and shortages. The purpose of this research was to review management policies addressing potable water paucity caused by Hurricane Irma. A survey was used to understand these policies' effects from the general public's perspective. The perceived effectiveness of these policies was analyzed via cross-tabulations. The results of the study identified several issues with potable water management related to hurricanes: (1) economic constraints that prevent obtaining drinking water, (2) lack of concern or care in maintaining sanitary private wells, (3) inadequacy of policies encouraging locals to prepare for three days without regular water supplies, (4) greater water shortages experienced by younger respondents, and (5) residents who received emergency relief but did not require aid. The results also identified potential improvements in drinking water management in the face of hurricanes and can enhance potable water management to avoid loss of well-being in future hurricanes.

AB The landscape configuration of socio-ecological land systems results from the interaction between the environmental conditions (relatively homogeneous within ecoregions) and country-level management and land-use decisions. However, social, land-use and sustainability research disciplines often study each independently. We used Euclidean distance analyses of five indicators of land systems functioning to explore the geographical patterns of across-border human-induced asymmetries in transnational ecoregions of South America. The most asymmetric transnational ecoregions occurred in the tropical rainforest biome which also showed the widest range of asymmetry values compared to other biomes. In contrast, transnational ecoregions in montane grasslands showed comparatively little asymmetries, and tropical dry forests showed intermediate asymmetry values. This pattern indicates that major asymmetries occur in land systems located in productive biomes with a comparatively recent history of development, whereas mature socio-ecosystems with a long history of human land use are more homogeneous across borders. In some cases, asymmetries may stabilize as a consequence of reinforcing feedbacks that promote contrasting land-use decisions across borders, including, for example, the establishment of protected areas, or the promotion of agro-industrial activities. Transnational socio-ecological land systems can be used to evaluate alternatives for sustainable development because they highlight the influence of institutions under different governance regimes in defining the spatial configuration and ecological properties of regions. We invite land-use and sustainability scientists to consider political border interactions as valuable "natural experiments" to better understand the interrelations between biophysical and political systems in defining planetary geographical-ecology in the Anthropocene.

AB The High Conservation Value (HCV) concept, developed by the Forest Stewardship Council to promote sustainable forest management, is widely employed for certification of forestry and agriculture concessions, and has been adopted by many logging and palm oil companies. HCV criterion 1, which deals with "endemic, and rare, threatened or endangered species", is rarely used in certification, mainly because lists of these species are incomplete, especially for plants, and performing threat assessments is time-consuming. The IUCN Red List Categories are often suggested as a suitable basis to define threatened taxa for the application of HCV1, but this requires the rapid and efficient assessment of large numbers of species. Using the plants endemic to Gabon as a case study, we propose a rapid, two-step procedure to identify HCV1 species. First, based on 3,298 verified and geo-referenced herbarium records, we used GIS layers and an automated computational workflow in the R environment to identify potentially threatened species using an approach aligned with IUCN Red List criteria A, B, and D. Ninety percent of the automated assessments correctly indicated the risk of extinction; errors involved incorrect assessments of species whose habitat is in reality not threatened, or occurred during the calculation of the number of locations (sensu IUCN) when a single threat impacts large areas. In a second step designed to correct these issues and comply with the Red List guidelines, we performed species-by-species verification of the automated assessments, taking into account the ecology and habitat of each species and the nature of the threats it faces. Of the 389 endemic taxa analyzed, 86 % were identified as threatened (83 CR, 171 EN, and 80 VU); of these, only 35 % are recorded from at least one National Park, but most are found in logging/oil palm (72 %) or mining (55 %) concessions, underscoring the need to improve the application of the HCV concept. To strengthen the use of HVC subcriterion 1.2 (rare, threatened or endangered species), we propose an explicit method for identifying rare species based on a quantitative threshold of the Extent of Occurrence (20,000 km2), and we examine the concept of endemicity with respect to the application of HVC subcriterion 1.3 (endemic species). The proposed methodology addresses an urgent need to develop a national interpretation of the HCV concept in Gabon, adopted as a national standard for logging concessions, and offers an efficient, reliable approach for the application of HVC1 elsewhere in Central Africa.

AB The individuals of many species shift habitats at different stages in their lives. Sometimes, these habitat shifts coincide with an ontogenetic transition. These ontogenetic habitat shifts can allow species to access nutritional resources, avoid conspecific aggression or predation, or secure breeding opportunities when it is advantageous to do so. The Kermadec Islands giant limpet Scutellastra kermadecensis is a protandrous hermaphrodite endemic to Rangitahua, the Kermadec Islands. These limpets have an unusual habit whereby small limpets (piggies) piggy-back on the shells of larger individuals rather than living on the rocky substrate. We investigated whether the ontogenetic habitat shift between the piggy-backing and rock-attached limpets was determined by the availability of free space on the rock or whether the ontogenetic habitat shift was a response to the properties of the surrounding limpet population. We found that the available rock space did not influence the size at which an individual transitioned from being a piggy to being rock-attached. Furthermore, larger rock-attached limpets were more likely to have piggies, they had more piggies, and the piggies were larger. Overall, our results suggest that Kermadec giant limpets are motivated to piggy-back by the properties of the social environment rather than space constraints. The piggy-backing behaviour may be a mechanism to avoid bulldozing by larger limpets, to access grazing opportunities on the shells of larger limpets, and/or to monopolise breeding opportunities with larger rock-attached females. We discuss the repercussions of this life-history strategy for this extremely range-restricted species, with reference to how these populations may be monitored and maintained.

AB The invasion, or "encroachment," of native conifers commonly occurs in the absence of frequent fire in deciduous woodlands and grasslands of the Pacific Northwest, USA. To effectively target restoration activities, managers require a better understanding of the outcomes of prescribed fire and the spatial patterns of conifer invasions. We examined the duration of prescribed fire effectiveness for managing conifer invasions, as well as multiple site characteristics (including distance to potential seed trees, prescribed fire history, and topographic variables) that influenced conifer invasions following fire in grassland and oak woodland communities in the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park, California. Prescribed fire substantially reduced counts of small conifers (<0.91 m in height), but reinvasion was rapid for sites <= 75 m from the forest edge, returning to pre-fire levels by 2 years post-fire. Following prescribed fires, the presence of conifers was largely determined by the proximity of overstory trees, with more than 95% of conifer seedlings (stems <1.37 m in height) found within 44 m of an overstory conifer. Number of fires and years since the most recent fire were not strongly related to counts of conifer seedlings and density of conifer saplings (stems from 0.1 to 10 cm diameter at breast height, 1.37 m). Our results suggest that in the Bald Hills vulnerability to conifer invasion is principally a function of proximity to seed sources, and the frequent application of prescribed fire or surrogate treatments are needed to prevent conifer seedlings from attaining fire-resistant sizes.

AB Co-occurring tree functional types (TFTs) within forest-savanna transitions may differ in seedling responses to grass competition and fire in savannas. We performed a common garden experiment in the Guinea savanna of Ghana to test hypotheses related to competition effects on growth, allocation to root storage reserves, and subsequent survival responses to dry season fire for savanna-transitional TFT (i.e., species occurring both in forest and savanna) and forest TFT. The experiment included factorial combinations of TFT, comprising four species each of forest versus savanna-transitional trees, wet season grass competition (grass competition vs. grass no-grass competition), and dry season fire (burn vs. no-burn). Partly consistent with prediction, we found that grass competition suppressed tree seedling growth and caused a 17% reduction in root non-structural carbohydrates concentration [NSC] but had no effect on direct survival regardless of TFT at the end of the wet season. Post-fire survival averaged 6% for forest versus 91% for savanna-transitional TFTs across competition treatments. In contrast to our prediction on how grass competition influences post-fire seedling survival, a history of grass competition did not result in lower post-fire survival regardless of TFT, although plant mass, root mass fraction, and root [NSC] at the end of the dry season were lower for tree seedlings with a history of competition. Our results demonstrate that grass competition suppresses tree seedling growth and root storage reserves irrespective of TFT, and that competition alone (without fire) may not preclude the establishment of forest seedlings in savannas close to forests.

AB A range of social and economic factors impact tree species, such as Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula), which provide livelihood sustenance for local communities in the savanna woodlands of southern Africa. As an ecologically important savanna species, valued both culturally and economically, it is imperative to understand if resource use is sustainable. Population stability can be understood by comparing tree density and size-class distribution (SCD) profiles across land-use types (homestead yards, fields and rangelands) in non-conservation savanna social-ecological systems. Marula tree population data were gathered in rangeland transects and randomly selected fields and yards from four human settlements in the Bushbuckridge municipality of northeastern South Africa. Total density was lowest in fields (mean ? SE = 7.4 ? 0.7 trees/ha) and highest in homestead yards (mean ? SE = 25.7 ? 4.1 trees/ha). Social data revealed that elevated seedling and sapling population densities in yards is linked to discarded kernels from marula beer making. Total densities increased in yards over a 15-year period but declined in rangelands, with female densities remaining almost constant across land-use types over this period. This is an important finding as it is a strong indication of socially-mediated population structure changes, confirming that combined cultural and economic value can lead to examples of species conservation. In this case, the prioritization of female trees as the distinguished fruit producers. SCD revealed weak recruitment in fields and rangelands. Diminished regeneration, combined with overharvesting for fuelwood in rangelands and felling trees in yards, is likely to negatively impact population stability in the longterm. Understanding resource conservation and degradation in the context of important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is a key knowledge challenge, with this study serving as an updated inventory benchmark for marula populations in the area. Important lessons learned here can be applied to other social-ecological contexts where a key natural resource is responsible for sustaining livelihoods.

AB American Crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) are broadly distributed throughout coastal and low-elevation tropical wetlands in the Americas and Caribbean. Despite years of ecological research on this species, there is still a dearth of behavioral data on wild American Crocodiles. Our project established diurnal time-activity budgets for American Crocodiles in Belize and evaluated behavioral patterns in relation to season (wet and dry) and time of observation (morning and afternoon). Crocodiles are dynamic and alter activity budgets in response to seasonal, temporal, and climatic changes, thus the use of time-activity budgets can be significant for documenting behavioral patterns, and a tool to quantify bioenergetic investment. We collected behavioral observations of wild crocodiles from multiple sites in Belize from May 2015 to August 2017. American Crocodiles allotted the greatest amount of time performing maintenance activities, including basking and floating on the surface of the water with head or body exposed. We found time allotment for other behaviors, particularly agonistic and social displays, were proportionally greater during the dry season in conjunction with the breeding season. Overall, our research creates a current baseline from which further studies could investigate changes in activity budgets in relation to mounting threats from climate change and anthropogenic activity.

DE governance; protected areas; biodiversity conservation; Sub-Saharan

AB We examine the conservation effects attributable to changes in the size of community-governed protected areas (PAs) by adopting a generalized difference-in-difference (DID) design with a two-way fixed effect regression model and synthetic control methods. Panel data from the extraordinary datasets of the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPAs) and the Red List of International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are used for 32 Sub-Saharan African countries in this study. Our generalized DID estimates show that countries with community-governed PAs have reduced the IUCN Red List threat level by 17% for mammals. We also find stronger evidence of the effect of community-governed PAs on the IUCN threat level using synthetic control method that allows us to match the "intervention countries" with those countries that exhibit similar pre-intervention threat level. Our results are robust on alternate specifications in which we exploit variations in the cumulative size of the designated PAs differentiated by the IUCN governance types. We also compare the effect of strictly state-governed PAs with community-governed PAs. Our findings provide evidence in support of recent qualitative studies that find positive responses of community participation towards common goods that carry potential economic incentives. This paper contributes to the idea that inclusive environmental policies and legislations yield environmental gains not at the cost of social exclusion.

AB Plankton are widely considered to be at the mercy of ocean currents, even after decades of research revealing that plankton regulate dispersal by positioning themselves in surface and bottom currents flowing in different directions. The degree of effectiveness of these behaviors remains controversial, because tiny plankters cannot be tracked at sea. Here, we experimentally tested the effectiveness of 3 vertical positioning behaviors in nature by developing a biomimetic robot that emulates them. We conducted a challenging test by deploying them in complex circulation during strong upwelling winds and wind relaxation and reversal events. Behavior alone dramatically affected transport. Transport trajectories of robots with 3 different behaviors diverged markedly while those sharing the same behavior were very similar. Moreover, all 3 behaviors produced trajectories that matched previously modeled projections during both upwelling and relaxation conditions at the study site: shallow plankton disperse far, deep plankton move little, and plankton migrating from depth during the day to the surface at night travel an intermediate distance. The ability of weakly swimming plankton to control their fate and replenish populations in a dynamic ocean is of central importance to the ecology and evolution of marine life and to the management of resources in a changing climate.

AB Rare plant species often suffer less damage than common species because of positive density-dependent herbivory, and it has been suggested that this 'rare species advantage' fosters plant species coexistence. However, it is unknown whether rare species have an advantage when pollination interactions are also considered.
   We hypothesized that a 'positive density-dependent pollination success' across plant species would result in common plants experiencing higher seed set rates compared to rare species, and that positive density-dependent effects would negate or even override the positive density-dependent damage due to herbivory resulting in higher seed loss rates in common plant species.
   We tested this hypothesis by concurrently examining a plant-predispersal seed predator system and a plant-pollinator system for 24 Asteraceae species growing in an alpine meadow community (Sichuan Province, China). Having previously reported a positive density-dependent effect on seed loss rates due to seed predators, we here focus on the density-dependent effects on pollination success by investigating pollinator species richness, visitation frequencies and seed set rates for each plant species. We also estimated the seed output rate of each plant species as the product of seed set rate and the rate of surviving seeds (i.e. 1 - the seed loss rate).
   Consistent with our hypothesis, a positive density-dependent effect was observed for pollinator species richness, visitation frequencies and seed set rates across plant species. Moreover, the positive effect overrode the negative density-dependent effect of herbivores on seed production, such that common species tended to have a higher seed output rate than rare species (i.e. we observed a 'rare species disadvantage').
   These results indicate that the low seed output rate of rare species might result from a pollination limitation, and that both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions should be examined simultaneously to fully understand plant species coexistence in local communities.

TI Antlion allometry suggests a greater importance of prey capture among

AB First larval stages require adequate feeding to reach subsequent instars. However, the accumulation of reserves is also important in the last larval instar because it is vital to pupate and successfully perform metamorphosis into adulthood. We indirectly determined the presence of changes in the relative importance of prey capture through larval ontogeny in the antlion larvae (Neuroptera Myrmeleontidae), a sit-and-wait predator with three instar stages that capture preys that fall into their pit-traps. We used scaling relationships between the size of body parts directly related to prey capture (prothorax) versus those that are not (thorax + abdomen). The prothorax (neck, head, and mandibles) is used in the pit building, prey capture, and re-capture, and pit cleaning. We measured the body parts of 70 larvae of Myrmeleon crudelis in a tropical rain forest of Costa Rica. The prothorax showed negative allometry: it was proportionally larger in the first than in the last instars. These results support the growth hypothesis, which states that food acquisition is key in the earlier stages of larval development. First instars can be more food-limited than later instars because they build small pit-traps where only very small arthropods can fall; have smaller mandibles and relatively lower grab force, increasing the probability of the prey escaping; and have smaller fat reserves and thus, are unable to resist long periods of starvation. This illustrates the relevance of using scaling relationships to better understand how ecological pressures change along ontogeny, emphasizing the role of food acquisition at earlier ontogenetic stages

AB East Africa is a hotspot of biodiversity with many endemic plant species. We describe three new species of the genus Uvariodendron (Annonaceae) from the coastal forests of Kenya and Tanzania. Uvariodendron mbagoi Dagallier & Couvreur, sp. nov. is endemic to Tanzania and unique within the genus by its strong bergamot scent and its tomentose fruits having regular tufts of higher hair density. Uvariodendron dzomboense Dagallier, W.R.Q. Luke & Couvreur, sp. nov. is endemic to Dzombo Hill in Kenya and is rendered distinct by its small leaves and very densely pubescent carpels. Uvariodendron schmidtii W.R.Q. Luke, Dagallier & Couvreur, sp. nov. is endemic to Shimba Hills in Kenya and differs by its small flowers and fused sepals forming a ring. Following IUCN criteria we assessed U. mbagoi and U. dzomboense as endangered (EN) while U. schmidtii is assessed as Vulnerable (VU). We also propose a new combination: Polyceratocarpus oligocarpus (Verdc.) Dagallier, comb. nov. The description of these three new species underlines the richness in endemics in East Africa and that new discoveries might arise from further botanical exploration of this region.

AB 1. Anthropogenic land-use change alters the ecological communities in a landscape's remaining natural habitat. These matrix effects are understudied in rare species, which comprise a majority of biodiversity, contribute to ecosystem services, and are particularly vulnerable to population declines.
   2. This study used bee species survey data from New Jersey forest fragments, in conjunction with an independent museum data set, to identify rare bee species and developed regularised regularised regression models of matrix effects on their richness and abundance.
   3. By using a regularised modelling approach, this study explains 44.43% of variation in rare bee species richness between forest fragments and 27.27% of variation in their abundance (average adjusted R-2).
   4. The present study's results identified specific subcategories of urban land use in the surrounding 1000 m of forest fragments that explained patterns in rare bee species richness and abundance, providing insights into how to select forest fragments to conserve rare bees. Low priority should be given to fragments in close proximity to high- and medium-density housing, which likely harms rare bees by increasing impervious surface cover. Low priority should also be given to fragments near golf courses and athletic fields; this study speculates that these land uses harm rare bees through mowing and pesticide application. Finally, high priority should be given to fragments composed of a larger proportion of mature forest, which likely provides a greater diversity of native floral resources. Altogether, this study's model results reveal the importance of matrix habitats for the biodiversity of rare species in forest fragments.

AB Calcrete Bontveld is a mosaic vegetation that occurs on flat-topped calcareous ridges adjacent to solid Valley Thicket in the Albany Thicket biome of South Africa. It consists of thicket clumps (bushclumps) scattered in a grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. While the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld represent the thicket component in the mosaic the extent and nature of similarity between the bushclumps and adjacent solid Valley Thicket remains unresolved. This study considers the relationship between the thicket communities of these two spatially separate but proximal vegetation types. As expected, bushclumps share a substantive compositional similarity and structure with the nearby solid Valley Thicket but minimally so with the surrounding grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. The latter is made up of elements of other biomes with only a few thicket taxa. The Bushclump composition differs from the adjacent solid Valley Thicket in that it is less succulent and less diverse in the number of plant families. A total of 22 Thicket species were absent from the bushclumps notably a few iconic ones: trees Portulacaria afra, shrubs Cotyledon velutina, Euphorbia mammilaris and Kalanchoe rotundifolia, as well as the geophyte, Gasteria bicolor. By contrast, only 8 taxa were found only in the bushclumps, but not in the local form of solid Valley Thicket (e.g. Ptaeroxylon obliquum and Scolopia zeyheri). Several of these have a Cape Thicket affinity e.g. trees Colpoon compressum and Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus and the shrub Diospyros dichrophylla. The absence of many adjacent thicket species from the bush clumps provides evidence for exchange exclusion of propagules of some Valley Thicket taxa from the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld. However, the unique bushclumps are a suitable habitat for establishment of the more distant Cape-affinity taxa.

AB Robinia pseudoacacia L. has been widely planted worldwide for a variety of purposes, but it is a nonindigenous species currently invading the central part of Japanese river terraces. To understand and control this invasion, we investigated how this species invests nitrogen resources in different functions depending on the leaf location, and how these resources are used in physiological reactions such as photosynthesis. The Tama river terrace was examined in Tokyo, Japan. The leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, Chl a/b ratio, leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCo) concentration were all significantly lower in shade leaves than in leaves exposed to the sun. Conversely, the net photosynthetic rate in saturated light conditions (P-max), the net photosynthetic rate under enhanced CO2 concentration and light saturation (A(max)), the maximum carboxylation rate of RuBisCo (V-cmax) and the maximum rate of electron transport driving RUBP regeneration (J(max)) were all significantly lower in shade leaves than in leaves exposed to the sun. We also found that RuBisCo/N and Chl/N were significantly less in shade leaves, and values of J(max)/N, V-cmax/N less in shade leaves than in sun leaves, but not significantly. Allocation of nitrogen in leaves to photosynthetic proteins, RuBisCo (N-R) was broadly less in shade leaves, and N-L (light-harvesting complex: LHC, photosystem I and II: PSI and PSII) and N-E (electron transport) were also lower. The N remaining was much greater in shade leaves than in sun leaves. We suggest that N remobilization from RuBisCo is more efficient than remobilization from proteins of N-E, and from N-L. This study shows that R. pseudoacacia has an enhanced ability to adapt to environmental changes via characteristic changes in N allocation trade-offs and physiological traits in its sun and shade leaves.

TI Do Weeds Hinder the Establishment of Native Plants on a Reclaimed North
   American Boreal Mine Site?
SO DIVERSITY-BASEL

DT Article
DE reclamation; boreal; competition; plant community; weedy species
AB The majority of plant diversity in the boreal forest of northern Alberta, Canada is comprised of native understory plant species that are continuously facing competition from other species, including both undesirable native and weedy species. In oil sands mine reclamation, cover soils rich in organic matter are used to cap overburden materials. The aim of this study is to understand the role of weeds on different reclamation cover soils (forest floor-mineral mix and peat-mineral mix) and determine if they hinder the establishment of the native plant community. This study was conducted four growing seasons after site establishment in June 2019. At that time, both soil types had approximately 45% total cover, had 21 species per plot, and were composed of mainly native vegetation. Competition from non-native forbs (11% average cover, mainly Sonchus arvensis and Melilotus alba) did not seem to impact the development of the native vegetation community on either soil type given the high cover and richness of native forbs. However, native graminoids (predominantly Calamagrostis canadensis) were associated with reduced native forb cover and richness at graminoid cover greater than 17%. Overall, non-native forbs appeared to have little impact on the native forb community on either soil type while native graminoids had a negative influence. We suggest that the classification of what is considered an undesirable weedy species should be evaluated in the context of ecosystem management goals rather than simply the presence of non-native species.

TI Australian advances in vegetation classification and the need for a

AB This editorial introduces the Australian Journal of Botany special issue 'Vegetation science for decision-making'. Vegetation science and classification are crucial to understanding Australian landscapes. From the mulga shrublands of the arid interior to the monsoon rain forests of northern Australia, we have culturally and scientifically built upon the delineation of vegetation into recognisable and repeatable patterns. As remote sensing and database capacities increase, this improved capability to measure vegetation and share data also prompts collaboration and synthesis of complex, specialised datasets. Although the task faces significant challenges, the growing body of literature demonstrates a strong discipline. In Australia, purpose-driven products describe vegetation at broad scales (e.g. the National Vegetation Information System, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network). At fine scales however (i.e. that of the vegetation community), no uniform framework or agreed protocols exist. Climate and landform dictate vegetation patterns at broad scales, but microtopography, microclimate and biotic processes act as filters at finer scales. This is the scale where climate-change impacts are most likely to be detected and effected; this is the scale at which a deeper understanding of evolutionary ecology will be achieved, and it is the scale at which species need to be protected. A common language and system for understanding Australian communities and impetus for collecting data at this scale is needed. In the face of ongoing climate and development pressures and an increasingly complex set of tools to manage these threats (e.g. offset policies, cumulative impact assessments), a nationally collaborative approach is needed. It is our hope that this special issue will help to achieve this.

AB Wildlife-based tourism poses opportunities and challenges for species conservation. Minimizing potential negative impacts of tourism is critical to ensure business and conservation enterprises can coexist. In north-western Namibia tourism is used as a conservation tool for the Critically Endangered black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis. However, black rhinoceroses are susceptible to human disturbance and may become displaced by tourist activities, which threatens not only the security and health of the rhinoceros population but also the sustainability of the business. We examined areas avoided by black rhinoceroses to understand how they respond to the type and extent of tourism development, and to evaluate management alternatives. We used spatial data on use of water sources by rhinoceroses to create a series of a priori candidate models that described the negative influences of tourist activities on rhinoceros habitat use. A model selection approach strongly supported a cumulative zones of influence model comprised of a 6 km buffer around the airstrip combined with a 1 km buffer around roads used daily. We compared alternative management scenarios using the best-performing model and found that an optimal road-use policy combined with airstrip relocation could minimize the total area avoided by the black rhinoceros to 7.1% and loss of high quality habitat to 20.7%. Under the worst-case scenario the area avoided and loss of high quality habitat were 153 and 85% greater, respectively, than under the scenario with optimal management. Our findings provide a novel framework and a practical, policy-relevant decision support tool to improve the contribution of tourism to wildlife conservation.

AB Pollination is one of the essential ecosystem services. In recent years, a severe global pollinator decline has been the prime concern of pollination scientists and agriculturalists. The red dwarf honey bee (Apis florea F.) is an important pollinator of the semi-arid to tropical environments of several parts of Asia. The actual status of the colony numbers and foraging populations of this honey bee are not known. In this article, I examined the status of these parameters of this honey bee in Northwest India. I conducted monthly surveys and counted the total number of colonies of the red dwarf honey bee present at the main campus of CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar (India) (in about 9 km(2)) from 1984 to 2011 at an interval of three years. I also counted the number of foraging honey bees on two crops, viz. a winter-flowering crop, Raya (Brassica juncea Czern & Coss), and a summer-flowering crop, Carrot (Daucus carota L). In 27 years, the number of colonies of this honey bee in the study area declined from 221.5 +/- 14.1 in 1984 to 53.4 +/- 6.6 in 2011. The foraging populations of this honey bee too declined from 31.2 +/- 0.3 bees/m(2) to 9.2 +/- 0.2 bees/m(2) on Carrot and from 25 +/- 0.3 bees/m(2) to 3.3 +/- 0.2 bees/m(2) on Raya. This honey bee exhibited a significant decline in its colony number every 6 years. Foraging bees declined significantly every three years. The colony and forager surveys revealed that the red dwarf honey bee (Apis florea F.) seemed to face the threat of extirpation (local extinction) in Northwest India. This decline in the colony numbers and the foraging populations seemed to have caused a pollination crisis in this region. The decline in the colony numbers and the foraging populations seemed to be caused by the poisoning of foraging bees due to the excessive and indiscriminate use of insecticides on the Cotton and/or Rice crops that come in blooms during the floral dearth period of this region. Considered the importance of this honey bee in the pollination of crops, I suggested that this honey bee must be vigorously protected and conserved.

AB The temporal pattern of flower opening and closure is a feature of the biology of many plant species, particularly those inhabiting oceanic islands where flowering generally lasts for only a few hours per day. Additionally, flower visitors often seek different floral sources on a timely basis, thus the relative timing of interactions is central to their status in pollination competition, or in the facilitation of pollination among co-flowering plants sharing pollinators. However, few studies have examined the impacts of daily temporal variation in flowering patterns on the pollinator network and competition on a community scale. In order to examine whether the daily pattern of flower opening and closure can impose temporal dynamics on interspecific interactions within a single day, plant-pollinator interaction networks (AM subweb and PM subweb) were quantified, and the relevant interactions between the two subwebs were compared using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of visitation frequencies in an oceanic island community (Paracel Islands, South China Sea). The role of species within networks and its variation between two subwebs were assessed by calculating the species-level specialization and species strength of each plant and pollinator species. The quantitative plant-pollinator interaction dissimilarity between morning and afternoon subsets was 0.69, and this value dropped to 0.58 when considering plant species flowering throughout the day. In our study, this dissimilarity between the two subwebs might be explained by the morning peak activity rather than a preference for morning flowers. No significant differences were detected in the species-level specialization and species strength of plants flowering all day from morning to afternoon at the community level. The flower visitation rates of native honeybee Apis cerana were not significantly different between morning and afternoon for most of the whole-day flowering plants. However, plant species only flowering either in the morning or the afternoon differed in the rate of visitation by A. cerana. The analyses of variation in the visitation rates of pollinators shared by plants within a single day in the studied community suggest that daily structuring at a community level and half-day staggered flowering during the morning or afternoon might reduce competitive interactions in oceanic insular habitats.

AB Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis (Varunidae), is one of the most popular and widely cultivated freshwater crab species in the Chinese food industry, with high commercial importance and nutritional value. We analyzed the diversity of culturable fungi in the gut of E. sinensis collected from a rice-crab co-culture system in Tianjin, China. We isolated 41 fungal strains from the gut of analyzed male and female crabs, using the dilution plate method. Morphological and molecular identification based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing suggested that these isolates belonged to 16 genera in Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota. Aspergillus was the dominant identified genus followed by Penicillium and Talaromyces. Yeasts, including Candida, Clavispora, Meyerozyma, and Trichosporon genera, accounted for a significant portion (12.2%) of the isolated strains. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in gut-associated fungal communities between female and male crabs, with female individuals showing a higher species diversity. Our study represents the first report on intestinal fungal communities of Chinese mitten crab, providing valuable microbiological information that could be essential for supporting the effective management and conservation of this crab species, and for the improvement of the economic performance of the crab industry.

AB Allocation of more resources to growth but less to defense causing growth vigor of invasive alien plant populations contributes to successful invasion. However, few studies has addressed to relationship between vascular development variation and this mechanism. In this study, a common garden experiment was established to compare the growth and vascular bundle development between native and introduced populations of Solidago canadensis, which is a wide-distributed invasive species in China. Our results suggested that the rapid growth of introduced populations could be explained by the well-developed and highly lignified xylem; while native populations present more developed and highly lignified phloem, which contributed more resistance to the infection of Sclerotiun rofsii compared with introduced populations. This difference was resulted from tissue-specific tradeoff distribution of lignification related gene expression between xylem and phloem, which is regulated by upstream MYB transcription factors. Our study gives a novel insight of mechanism that explain invasion success: lignin-related gene transcription-mediated tissue-specific lignification of vascular bundle contributes tradeoffs in resource allocation between growth and defence capacity during successful invasion of S. canadensis.

AB Background and aims - This work provides the first pattern analysis of the alien flora of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R. Congo), using Asteraceae and Fabaceae as a case study.
   Methods - Based on herbarium collections, existing databases, and literature data, a database of 38 alien species of Asteraceae and 79 alien species of Fabaceae has been assembled. Patterns in the introduction pathway, phylogeny. life form, morpho-functional traits, geographic origin, and occurrence in D.R. Congo are explored.
   Key results - America is the main source continent in both families, but Asia is also an important donor of Fabaccae. Taxonomic spectrum discrepancies between the alien and the native flora reflect the continent of origin. Sixty-six percent of alien Asteraceae have been accidentally introduced, most of which being annual weeds of disturbed soil. In contrast, 90% of alien Fabaccac have been deliberately introduced for forestry, agriculture, or enviromnental purposes, most of which being phanerophytes. Traits were compared between pairs of congeneric alien and native species. For Asteraceae. a sharp discrepancy was found in the life form spectrum (aliens: mostly therophytes; natives: phanerophytes). For Fabaceae, alien species had larger leaves and larger pods compared to their native congeners. The number of specimens in collections was positively correlated with the time since the date of first collection for both families. The Guineo-Congolian region has the highest number of alien Fabaceae, while alien Asteraceae are overrepresented in the Zambezian region.
   Conclusions - Contrasting patterns between alien Asteraceae and Fabaceae in the flora of D.R. Congo in terms of life forms, trait divergence compared to the native flora, and occurrence, reflect the divergent biological attributes and relations to humans of the two families. The striking discrepancies between the two families call for analyses of patterns of alien flora at family level and warn against global generalisations.

AB Natural regeneration is a critical step for the dispersal of alien plants and the establishment of new invasive foci. The adequate timing and location of germination, as well as the survival of the seedlings, have direct effects on the recruitment of the population, and are expected to depend on habitat characteristics. Understanding the dynamics of these processes, and their variations according to the landscape at different scales, can be particularly important to design and implement control strategies. In this article, we evaluate differences in seedling emergence and establishment of Pinus halepensis in highland grasslands of the Argentine pampas, according to altitude, orientation of the slope and vegetation cover. Our results showed spatial variation on the rate of seedling emergence, with topography as a determining factor, possibly due to a facilitating effect on the slopes with higher incident solar radiation (NE at the study site). Slope exposition, on the contrary, seemed to have the opposite effect on the survival of seedlings. Once established, seedlings also survived better in sites with less solar exposure, probably due to protection from high evapotranspiration during the summer. These results could explain variations in the invasive performance of the species and guide management actions aimed at preventing its further expansion in the study area and in other habitats with similar characteristics.

AB The tiny epizoic limpetLottia tenuisculptalives on rocky surfaces and shells of the snailsOmphalius nigerrimusandReishia clavigera.The movement patterns of the limpet on host snails was observed during 24 h under controlled laboratory conditions. A specific behaviour, referred to as returning behaviour and reminiscent of homing behaviour, was observed in seven out of 20 individuals, and two out of 15 individuals onO. nigerrimusandR. clavigera,respectively. Rotation behaviour, in which limpets changed the direction of the body by one hundred and eighty degrees without changing the position on host snails, was also observed very frequently (17 out of 20 individuals onO. nigerrimusand 10 out of 15 andR. clavigera). This is the first report of such a behaviour. The potential role of this behaviour in creating home scars is discussed.

AB The concentration of grazing around artificial and natural watering points in an arid region produces a system known as a piosphere. This study focused on the Lajaneh Piosphere, located in a dryZygophyllum eurypterumshrubland in north-east Iran. Vegetation and soil were sampled in Lajaneh Piosphere, to discern what amount of variation in plant species composition along a piosphere can be explained by environmental variables in addition to distance from the watering point. Elevation and geographical data were recorded along three transects extending across widely varied terrain up to 5 km from the piosphere. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) were used to evaluate the vegetation distribution as related to soil phosphorus (P), soil potassium (K), soil nitrogen (N), slope, aspect, elevation, and distance from water. Cover of palatable plant species increased with distance from the artificial watering point. Although the redundancy analysis resulted in much unexplained variation, we found the role of soil fertility factors and distance from water most important to plant species composition; soil nitrogen (N) (7.26%), soil phosphorus (P) (5.13%), soil potassium (K) (4.47%), and distance from water (1.77%) explained variations in vegetation community more than elevation (0.91%), aspect (0.42%) and slope (0.05%). Although the transects extended across a varied terrain through a gorge into an adjacent basin and onto a plateau similar to 100 m above and below the watering point on the basin floor, distance from the piosphere still was more important in explaining plant species variance than topographic factors. In general, the grazing pressure decreased with distance from water and related with high concentration of soil nutrients. Understanding the magnitudes and orders of effects of different environmental variables on piospheres such as Lajaneh provides important understanding of environmental stresses in arid landscapes. Piospheres deserve further investigation to provide a basis for studying sustainable land management in arid and semi-arid regions.

   PREDATION
AB Intertidal limpets are important grazers along rocky coastlines worldwide that not only control algae but also influence invertebrates such as common barnacles. For instance, grazing limpets ingest settling barnacle cyprid larvae (hereafter cyprids) and push cyprids and barnacle recruits off the substrate. Such limpet disturbance effects (LDEs) can limit barnacle recruitment, a key demographic variable affecting barnacle population establishment and persistence. In this study, we examined limpet (Lottia cassis) disturbance to barnacle (Chthamalus dalli, Balanus glandula) recruitment on the Pacific coast of Hokkaido, Japan, as information on limpet-barnacle interactions from this region is missing. We investigated, for the first time, whether barnacle size and recruitment intensity influence LDEs on barnacle recruitment. Small barnacles may be less susceptible to LDEs than larger barnacles, because small size may reduce the propbability of limpet disturbance. Moreover, recruitment intensity can influence LDEs, as high recruitment can compensate for LDEs on barnacle recruitment density. In Hokkaido, C. dalli cyprids are smaller than B. glandula cyprids, and C. dalli recruitment is higher than B. glandula recruitment. Thus, we hypothesized that LDEs on C. dalli recruitment would be weaker than those on B. glandula recruitment. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment during which we manipulated limpet presence/absence on the interior surfaces of ring-shaped cages. After four weeks, we measured barnacle recruitment and recruit size on the interior surfaces of the cages and found negative LDEs on C. dalli and B. glandula recruitment and recruit size. As hypothesized, the LDEs on C. dalli recruitment were weaker than the LDEs on B. glandula recruitment. Additionally, C. dalli recruits were smaller than B. glandula recruits. However, the LDEs on C. dalli recruit size were as strong as the LDEs on B. glandula recruit size, indicating that the smaller C. dalli recruits are not less susceptible to LDEs than B. glandula recruits. Since C. dalli recruitment was higher than B. glandula recruitment, we propose that the higher C. dalli recruitment compensated for the LDEs on C. dalli recruitment. Our findings indicate that the detected differences in LDEs on barnacle recruitment are related to barnacle recruitment intensity but not recruit size.

AB A survey of pine-associated aphids and their parasitoids was carried out in the arboretum of Pinus halepensis Miller in the Higher Agronomic Institute Chott Mariem (ISA CM, Tunisia) during 2010-2011 and 2018. The survey revealed the presence of the aphid parasitoid species, Diaeretus leucopterus (Haliday) (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Aphidiinae). This is the first record of D. leucopterus from Tunisia and the African continent. The parasitoid emerged from the spotted green pine needle aphid, Eulachnus agilis (Kaltenbach) (Hemiptera, Aphididae, Lachninae), on P. halepensis. The generalist hyperparasitoid, Asaphes suspensus (Nees) (Hymenoptera, Pteromalidae), was also found attacking D. leucopterus. The diagnosis of the primary parasitoid, on the basis of relevant illustrations, was provided, and the possible routes of its transportation into North Africa were discussed.

AB The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) has historically been hunted and consumed by rural communities throughout its distribution range in Africa. This study aims to develop a processed product from warthog meat in the form of back bacon (Longissimus thoracis et lumborum) as a healthy alternative meat product and to determine its chemical and sensory characteristics derived from adult and juvenile boars and sows. The highest scored attributes included typical bacon and smoky aroma and flavor, and salty flavor, as well as tenderness and juiciness. Neither sex nor age influenced the bacon's chemical composition; the bacon was high in protein (similar to 29%) and low in total fat (<2%). Palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), linoleic (C18:2 omega 6), oleic (C18:1 omega 9c), and arachidonic (C20:4 omega 6) were the dominant fatty acids. There was an interaction between sex and age for the PUFA:SFA ratio (p = 0.01). The differences between sex and age class are considered negligible regarding the overall profile and healthiness of the bacon.

AB During the period of Japanese occupation (1910-1945) and the Korean War (1950-1953), extensive areas of forest were severely degraded by over-harvesting and fire in Korea. In addition, intensive use of the forest-resources to obtain fuel, organic compost, livestock feed, and so on contributed to forest degradation. As a result, the South Korean government launched large-scale tree planting projects to reforest the denuded mountains particularly in the 1960s. This study aims to evaluate the restoration effects of the pitch pine (Pinus rigidaMill.) plantations and further diagnose the invasive potential of the pitch pine. To arrive at the goals, we investigated the changes of vegetation and soil characteristics in different chronosequences in the pitch pine plantations and in native forests, which were selected as reference stands. Pitch pine plantations were usually planted on mountainous land, which is characterized by an elevation of below 300 m above sea level and a gentle slope below 20 degrees. The species composition of the pitch pine forestations was different depending on the study site but tended to resemble that of the reference stands in the years after forestation. The species diversity showed an increasing trend in response to stand age. The frequency distribution of diameter classes of dominant tree species showed a trend for pitch pine plantations to succeed to native oak stands. A change in canopy profiles depending on stand age also proved the successional trend. The establishment and development of pitch pine plantations for reforestation contributed to erosion control and improved the physic-chemical properties of the soil and thus prepared a basis for the recovery of native vegetation. Such changes in vegetation and soil confirmed that the pitch pine plantations successfully achieved the restoration goals. On the other hand, mature pitch pine stands reproduced young pitch pine stands by self-seeding on the slopes of various sorts of roads including expressways. This shows that pitch pine is successfully established in Korea and thereby the species has been naturalized. However, the natural succession of pitch pine stands in Korea suggests that it is possible to introduce some exotic species for reforestation without resulting in uncontrolled invasion.

AB Birds provide multiple ecological services that benefit humans including pollination. In Africa, sunbirds are the dominant vertebrate pollinator. Here we present a species-level assessment for African sunbirds of the number and relative frequency of their food plants that have useful properties to humans. We conducted this analysis by compiling and integrating known sunbird food plants with useful tropical plant and tropical cultivated plant databases. Across Africa, 68% of the 329 genera and 44% of the 468 species of sunbirds' known food plants are used by humans for medicine, food, building materials, or other uses. Yet most genera and species of useful plants are visited by a small number of sunbird species.The median number of sunbird species that visit a useful genus and species of plant is two and one, respectively. Of the 409 genera and 308 species of useful plants that are sunbird pollinated across one or more of the six predominant habitats for sunbirds, 67% of genera and 71% of species are pollinated by sunbird species that are forest or woodland dependent. Additionally, 58% of all genera and 83% of all species of useful plants pollinated by sunbirds are non-cultivated. In Africa, non-cultivated sunbird-pollinated useful plants are almost entirely collected, used, and traded locally rather than regionally or internationally. Our results indicate that African sunbirds provide important ecological services as pollinators that benefit humans, and these services are provided largely at a local scale. Given the decline of invertebrate and vertebrate pollinators both globally and in Africa, sunbirds are important to the long-term conservation of many useful plants in Africa and hence human well-being.

DE systematization; typology; zoning; geoecotone; structure; continuity;
   fuzzy set
AB Contrary to a widely held view of transitional (intermediate) objects as being "noise" in a research process, the idea that transitional objects are essential elements of classifications, regionalizations, periodizations and other structural schemes is substantiated. The methodological basis for these propositions is provided by the concepts of descriptive and fuzzy sets and its underlying multi-valued (fuzzy) logic. It is shown that there are several variants for the representation of transitional classes, regions and periods, and some of them allow avoiding "fragmentation" and an excessive increase in the number of transitional elements. It is emphasized that any variants of representation of transitional classes, regions or periods are only the formal (methodological) techniques which serve as a tool that allows more appropriately reflecting the structure of a single object or a set of objects. It is this principle that should determine selection of a particular variant of separation of transitional elements in structural schemes. It is noted that the concepts of the transitional class and the structure of the class lie at the intersection of classification and ordination approaches and allow developing ordination-classification schemes that combine the features of hierarchical classification and ordination. The concepts of transitional elements allowed suggesting new solutions to a number of problems. Communities of dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) are referred to a special class of formations: "hypoarctic krummholz". Three separate class formations of open woodland communities (woodlandtundra, woodland-meadow and woodland-bog) are identified. Macrocomplexes that include the mountain tundra, subgoletz (subalpine) and, partially, boreal-forest belts of vegetation were referred to a separate goletz (alpine) boreal-forest class. For the subgoletz belt, on the one hand, its independence as the belt of rank II, and, on the other, its transitional nature between goletz and boreal-forest belts of rank I are confirmed. Such solutions allow representing not only the transitional nature of the objects in question but also their uniqueness at a certain taxonomic level.

AB Invasion by Gleditsia triacanthos L. (honey locust) along the banks of Pampean streams and rivers appears to induce profound changes in species richness, macrophyte cover, and producer biomass. Seasonal effects of the invasion on macrophytes cover and biomass of seston, periphyton, and benthos were studied at three low order streams from the Pampas region (name them here), in sections with and without invasion of honey locust. We hypothesized that light reduction by honey locusts reduces macrophyte coverage and algal biomass, thereby modifying the structure of the stream communities. Incident light and nutrient concentrations showed differences between invaded and not invaded reaches. Stream sections with tree canopy showed a negative correlation with the percentage of macrophyte cover (R = -0.41, p < 0.05). In the three streams, the biomass of seston, periphyton and benthos was reduced in summer, when canopy cover was most developed. This study demonstrates that a high degree of honey locust invasion modifies the structure of aquatic communities of Pampean streams therefore urgent action is needed. Options for honey locust management are suggested.

AB Forest restoration is an effective tool to mitigate climate change, but its implementation in highly diverse and threatened tropical dry forests (TDFs) is particularly challenging due to the hostile environment. Intraspecific trait variability (ITV) in response to these constraints may be very informative for predicting the potential for species acclimation and therefore for improving trait-based species screenings that best match each particular scenario of forest restoration. We analyzed ITV during seedling establishment of three widely distributed and ecologically contrasting TDF species in a greenhouse multifactorial experiment crossing levels of resource availability (nutrients and water) and herbivory to assess the capacity of ITV to discern strategies of seedling establishment and to predict species' growth rates and acclimation potential. The three species studied had contrasting responses to the experimental treatments, suggesting different strategies of seedling establishment. The species with the most plastic pattern of growth performed the best, especially due to its ability to modulate the trade-off of root-to-shoot allocation of biomass depending on nutrient availability. Almost 50% of the variation in the root mass ratio was within species, half of which was a direct response of the treatments, indicating a strong acclimation potential. Individual-level trait measurements, however, were poor predictors of seedling growth rates. ITV, particularly the ability to adapt the pattern of biomass allocation, can be critical during seedling establishment. We propose incorporating information about ITV and the ability of species to modulate their phenotypic expression to cope with environmental variability into programs of forest restoration. Easily implemented and standardized greenhouse experiments are an inexpensive way to obtain high-quality data on the plasticity of forest species, which can be very valuable for predicting the potential of species acclimation and thus improving the selection of species that better match each particular scenario of restoration.

AB Antlion larvae of Myrmeleon brasiliensis (Navas, 1914) build their traps in a microenvironment with protection from the direct action of rain and other perturbations as well as microhabitats that are less protected from disturbances that can destroy the traps. Differences in microhabitats may affect the characteristics of the trap-building process due the high energy expenditure exerted in building and maintaining these traps, which led to the following question: Do antlion larvae of M. brasiliensis build larger traps in protected microhabitats? Considering the occurrence of M. brasiliensis larvae in two microhabitats and the measurements of the size of the larvae and their traps, the hypothesis was that larvae would occur in greater abundance and the trap size would be larger in more protected microhabitats. The results showed that antlions occurred in equal abundance in both microhabitats, but density was greater in the protected microhabitat. Even in months with more rainfall, M. brasiliensis larvae continued to forage throughout the year in the protected microhabitat and the investment in trap size was greater in this microhabitat. This suggests that the larvae of the protected microhabitat have an advantage, given that they have the possibility of foraging throughout the year.

AB Discothyrea is a genus composed of specialist predatory species rarely recorded and with little known biology. Specimen collection is usually associated with preserved native vegetation. In this work, we explore the landscape of sites with occurrence of Discothyrea seeking to improve knowledge about the natural history of this genus. Species of Discothyrea were recorded in ten Atlantic Forest sites. We analyzed the landscape around the place of occurrence of each species using a 500-m buffer. We classified the landscape as heterogeneous and homogeneous according to the percentage of natural (native vegetation), urban, and rural areas. We found 67 specimens of Discothyrea; 59 of them were D. sexarticulata, occurring in 88% of the fragments. There were also eight specimens of D. neotropica occurring in 12% of the fragments. The results show that D. sexarticulata can be found in homogeneous landscapes with anthropic influence (0-51% of rural area and 0-68% of urban area). Discothyrea neotropica is found in heterogeneous landscapes with a dominant presence of native vegetation (between 74-95%). The results improve knowledge on the biology of Discothyrea mainly in relation to the vicinity of occurrence sites. In addition, the results indicate that regional studies are important to understand species ecology.

AB Invasive species Commelina benghalensis L. was investigated for its morphological, anatomical aspects. Ecological studies were carried out to explore the floristic composition of its community type and assess the factors that affect its invasion to the study area. Furthermore, proximate analysis, mineral composition, phytochemical screening and GC/MS analysis of secondary metabolites were studied to explore the nature of compounds present and evaluate its potential uses. Forty-seven weed species related to 21 families were recorded in C. benghalensis community type. Poaceae, Asteraceae and Brassicaceae were the most important families. Portulaca oleracea, Cyperus rotundus, Dactyloctenium aegyptium and Euphorbia heterophylla were the common associates. Therophytes were the most frequent life-form (78.7%). The chorological analysis showed the prevalence of paleotropical, cosmopolitan and Mediterranean taxa. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that pH, cations (calcium, potassium, sodium and magnesium), anions (bicarbonates, sulphates and chlorides), soil texture (sand, silt and clay) and organic matter were the most effective soil variables for the distribution of C. benghalensis and its associated species in the study area. The highest values of succulence and mean leaf surface area were recorded in mango orchards, while the highest shoot length and phytomass were registered in the habitats of crop fields. The results also indicated that this plant is a valuable source of nutritional, mineral and phytochemical compounds; hence it can be used as potential source of relatively low-cost, palatable forage for livestock and might be of a very important medicinal value and should be explored further to extract new drugs. It should not be included in the harmful weeds.

AB Within the marine benthos, space is considered an absolute requirement that is often in limited supply. The often-low availability of this essential resource causes species to interact competitively through mechanisms of interference and exploitation. Species of encrusting algae, in particular, use overgrowth as a mechanism for interference competition, and variable growth rates have regularly been argued as a mechanism for exploitation competition. This study examined overgrowth interactions as a proxy for interference competition, and cover abundance as an indirect proxy for exploitation competition, to understand how encrusting algal species coexist. Cover abundance was shown to be tightly correlated with marginal growth rates (r = 0.99, p < 0.023), although data existed for only three of the six species examined, so it was not possible to use growth rate per se as a proxy for exploitation competition. The results additionally indicated a strong competitive hierarchy for both overgrowth competition and for cover abundance, and an inverse relationship between the two proxies (overgrowth vs cover abundance) of competition (upper mid-eulittoral zone, r = -0.81; lower mid-eulittoral zone, r = -1.00). Although postulated, none of the species that are seemingly subordinate in terms of overgrowth are excluded from their respective habitats. The reason for the coexistence between subordinate and superior overgrowth competitors can be argued through the interplay between interference and exploitation competition mechanisms, in which species that are typically always overgrown (poor interference competitors) maintain their existence largely because they are better at exploiting the limited available space because their faster growth rates result in higher cover abundances.

AB Fragmentation is a disruption in the connectivity of landscapes. The aims of this paper are (i) to quantitatively assess the fragmentation rates in three landscape units located in a hydrocarbon basin, and (ii) to model their behavior between 2001 and 2013 using landscape metrics at different scales of resolution. The following metrics were selected using principal component analysis (PCA): The Clumpiness Index (CLUMPY), patch density (PD), perimeter-area fractal dimension (PAFRAC) and effective mesh size (MESH). Results from our investigations pointed out that hydrocarbon activity increased the fragmentation at the sites. In particular, the CLUMPY index increased in all three landscape units, the average of PD decreased from 60 to 14 patches per 100 hectares, whereas the mean of MESH was quite constant, however, due to oil production, it decreased mainly in the coastal valleys. Finally, the PAFRAC also decreased at sites with oil production, being more evident in the plateau and coastal canyons. As a whole, outputs from our analyses clearly pointed out that the monitoring of landscape fragmentation trends in arid and semi-arid zones can be successfully achieved using metrics derived from satellite spectral information.

AB The rate of litter decomposition can vary within ecosystems that have high spatial heterogeneity, and many uncertainties remain regarding the abiotic and biotic factors that act as determinants of decomposition rates at small spatial scales. This study investigated the decomposition rates of leaves and fine roots of Croton sonderianus Mull. Arg., Poincianella pyramidalis Tul., and Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart. over 12 months in a semiarid ecosystem in Brazil. Twelve biotic and abiotic factors were also evaluated as local determinants of decomposition rates. A 2000 x 500 m grid was delimited within which thirty 20 x 20 m plots were established. Two sets of litterbags were installed in each plot, one containing a mixture of leaves and the other a mixture of roots. The approximate mean lost mass was 90% for leaf material and 47% for roots after 10 and 12 months, respectively. Due to the litterbag incubation sites being distributed in a heterogeneous area, values for the intrinsic decay coefficient (k) (through month) varied widely from a minimum of 0.073 to a maximum of 0.458 for leaf litter and from 0.045 to 0.077 for roots. Variation in the decay coefficients for leaves and roots was significantly explained by aerial plant biomass and litterfall production, respectively; more open areas exhibited the highest rates of decomposition. Vegetation structure that favors the exposure of soil to solar radiation can influence the decomposition process, promoting an increase in leaf, and fine root decomposition rates at small spatial scales in tropical semiarid ecosystems.

AB Arid Thicket transformation by domestic meso-herbivores is purported to follow a state-and-transition model. Our study represents a first attempt to verify this hypothesis in Pruim-Spekboomveld, a variation of Arid Thicket. We correlate structural and compositional attributes of thicket bush clumps to distance from artificial watering points in four piosphere treatments that have had a different rangeland management history. We fit linear, exponential and sigmoid regression models to our data and use Akaike's Information Criterion to select the best fitting model. Furthermore, we compare the end regions of our data in the piosphere treatments to each other and to similar data collected in a transformed and untransformed reference site. We use both the pattern and extent of transformation within and between the treatments and the reference sites, to verify the existence of stable states and ecological thresholds. Our results indicate a threshold reduction in species richness, functional type diversity, succulent shrub diversity, succulent shrub cover and palatable shrub cover; and a corresponding threshold increase in perennial alien invasive and ephemeral forb cover; with an increase in herbivore-induced transformation. These findings suggest that our treatments have crossed a degradation threshold and therefore represent an alternative stable state to the untransformed reference site.

AB Aircraft bird strikes are increasing globally. Bird strikes constitute a major human health and safety risk and result in millions of dollars in economic impacts. Invasive avian species, such as the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris; starlings), have been implicated in bird strikes in North America. Because this species is highly adaptive and has been successful at establishing in new areas, such as airports, it is essential that managers better understand the potential risks and how to mitigate them. Herein we present a case study regarding a novel observation of unique starling nesting behavior that may pose a risk to airport operations and aircraft.

AB The effects of herbivory on plant invasions are broadly discussed, and many studies have led to widely debated theories. In particular, the effects of herbivores on pine invasion found in different studies vary; in some cases, they controlled their expansion, and in others, they promoted it. On the other hand, vulnerability to invasion by pines differs between community types. Sites with dunes and bare ground are the most heavily invaded, followed by grasslands, while shrublands and forests are least invaded. Because current evidence is mostly observational, some of the varying responses of pine invasions to herbivory should be examined further through replicated experiments. Here, we address experimentally the extent to which preference for the non-native invasive Pinus contorta by domestic sheep (Ovis aries) depends on the vegetation type. We installed experimental enclosures within two adjacent communities, grassland and shrubland, and in each one, we planted seedlings of P. contorta Douglas and established a sheep density typically recommended for the study area. The number of browsed seedlings, the number and type of branches browsed per seedling, the reduction in height and probability of survival immediately after browsing period were recorded. The number of browsed seedlings and damage to the terminal bud were higher in grassland than in shrubland, while the number of browsed branches per seedling was higher in shrubland than grassland. The reductions in height and probability of survival immediately after browsing were similar in both communities. These results show that moderate levels of sheep herbivory could reduce 20% seedling survival in both communities; nevertheless, the damage patterns differ between them. The sheep browsed more substantial number of seedlings in grasslands than in shrublands. However, if sheep find the seedlings, they damage it more in shrublands. These results suggest that experimental studies comparing communities are important for pine invasion management.

AB Commercial plantations and alien tree invasions often have substantial negative impacts on local biodiversity. The effect of plantations on faunal communities in the fire-adapted fynbos vegetation of the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot is not yet well quantified. We studied small mammal community structure in alien Pinus radiata plantations and adjacent fynbos regenerating after clear-felling of plantations on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Small mammal sampling over 1,800 trap-nights resulted in 480 captures of 345 individuals (excluding recaptures) representing six species. Significantly more species, individuals (12 X) and biomasses (29 X) of small mammals occurred on recovering fynbos sites compared to plantations. This was commensurate with a higher diversity of plant growth forms, vegetation densities and live vegetation biomass. Only one small mammal species, the pygmy mouse (Mus minutoides), was consistently trapped within plantations. Fynbos sites were dominated by three small mammal species that are ecological generalists and early successional pioneer species, rendering the recovering fynbos slightly depauperate in terms of species richness and evenness relative to other studies done in pristine fynbos. We make three recommendations for forestry that would facilitate the restoration of more diverse natural plant communities and progressively more diverse and dynamic small mammal assemblages in a key biodiversity hotspot.

AB The embryonic metabolism of the saurischian dinosaur Troodon formosus and the ornithischian dinosaurs Protoceratops andrewsi and Hypacrosaurus stebingeri have been determined by using a mass growth model based on conservation of energy and found to be very similar. Embryonic and ontogenetic growth metabolisms are also evaluated for extant altricial birds, precocial birds, mammals, and crocodylians to examine for trends in the different groups of animals and to provide a context for interpreting our results for nonavian dinosaurs. This analysis reveals that the embryonic metabolisms of these nonavian dinosaurs were closer to the range observed in extant crocodylians than extant birds. The embryonic metabolisms of nonavian dinosaurs were in the range observed for extant mammals of similar masses. The measured embryonic metabolic rates for these three nonavian dinosaurs are then used to calculate the incubation times for eggs of 22 nonavian dinosaurs from both Saurischia and Ornithischia. The calculated incubation times vary from about 50 days for Archaeopteryx lithographica to about 150 days for Alamosaurus sanjuanensis.

AB Commercial seed mixes and various mechanical planting methods have been implemented to overcome barriers to successful restoration of degraded grasslands but their effectiveness in aiding the restoration process has been understudied. Harvested seed must be cleaned of chaff to allow mechanical planting, which can exclude small seeds. We propose that fluid seed drilling techniques (suspending uncleaned harvested seed in a cellulose-based gel matrix, which may then be injected into the soil with a mechanical planter) may overcome these challenges. As a preliminary investigation of the proposed method we designed a greenhouse pot trial experiment aimed at quantifying restoration success through the measurement of seedling recruitment, biomass production and composition responses of commercial and harvested seed mixes under simulated fluid seed drilling and smoke water priming (collectively termed application method). These data were analysed using generalised linear modelling and multivariate analyses. Commercial mixed seed resulted in greater recruitment, whereas harvested seed produced the greatest biomass production. There was large multivariate separation between seed types and seed type x application method centroids for recruitment responses and only seed type for biomass responses. Application method had minimal effects on restoration measurements whilst seed type greatly affected these measurements. Careful selection of the restoration seed mix is advised.

AB Perceptions of people towards the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) outside protected areas are central to the management programmes targeted at conserving large carnivores. We conducted interviews using a questionnaire to assess the attitudes and perceptions of people (n = 355) towards the spotted hyaena in western Zimbabwe from October 2014 to February 2015. The study area was split into Environmental Conservation Areas (ECAs) and communal areas based on their distance from the protected area (Fuller Forest) boundary. People's perceptions and attitudes were analysed using multinomial logistic regression. Top model ranking showed that the distance from protected area, livelihood source, and extent of livestock killed by spotted hyaenas had an influence on the perceptions of villagers about the species. Furthermore, it was noted that incentives may play a pivotal role in moderating the human-spotted hyaena conflict. It is recommended that a modified incentive-driven ECA model should be embraced in communal areas to promote and encourage positive attitudes towards the spotted hyaena and other wildlife.

AB A study involving several Clavariadelphus species present in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (FVTM, for short from Spanish: Faja Volcanica Transmexicana) was carried out to recognize patterns in richness and endemism. The study area was divided into a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude grid where 240 records from 14 national collections, specialized literature and institutional database were located. The data obtained show that the species richness present are heterogeneously distributed, where the highest number of species and records are concentrate at the central and eastern portions of the FVTM. The Complementarity Index (IC) for each combination of grid-cells resulted in relatively high values. Within the FVTM, 5 grid-cells are enough to represent the complete range of species from the genus Clavariadelphus in central Mexico. The grid-cell with the highest species richness and value of endemism coincides with the Natural Protected Area known as the Corredor Biologico Chichinautzin-Tepozteco, Morelos-Ciudad de Mexico-Estado de Mexico. It is concluded that the FVTM is a biodiverse zone of species of Clavariadelphus within which 68.4% of the total species known to the world are concentrated.

AB The dislodging effect of breaking waves is among the critically important factors structuring rocky intertidal communities. Because behavior is so difficult to study in the field, the interaction of wave force with behavior of intertidal organisms is poorly understood. Here, we present a field study of the interaction of breaking waves with the natural behavior of individuals of Lottia gigantea, an intertidal limpet with a complex territorial behavioral ecology. We hypothesized that limpets engaging in fast-moving territorial chase in response to intraspecific contact are more vulnerable to wash-off by a passing wave than are slowly foraging limpets that do not take part in such chase. We measured the lift force required to dislodge limpets while they were engaged in three natural behavioral responses to intraspecific contact in the field: 1.) continued foraging, 2.) retreat, and 3.) territorial pursuit. We divided the measured force-to-remove by aperture area to estimate resistance to wave-induced lift force, or tenacity. Tenacity (Newtons.cm(-2 )) in slowly foraging limpets was 2-4 times stronger than previously reported for moving limpets (retreating at high speed from sea stars). Small foraging limpets showed stronger tenacity than did large limpets. Tenacity was significantly reduced by high-speed territorial and retreat responses, especially in small limpets. We compounded the wash-off probabilities of tenacity during the expected number of high-speed chases in the face of an entire year of reported waves at a nearby ocean buoy, and estimated that limpets should suffer substantially greater mortality (11.5%) than do limpets that refrain from all territorial chase (2.9%). Overall, these data support our hypothesis that dislodgement by breaking waves comprises a significant risk attendant to territorial chase. The fact that limpets nevertheless engage in these chases suggests that the resources gained by this behavior are substantial.

AB Despite many scientific articles were devoted to study aspects of community ecology of ungulates in African savannahs, only very few studies focused on communities from Western Africa. In this paper, we analyse the interspecific interactions of savannah ungulates in the Nazinga Game Ranch (Burkina Faso) in relation to rainfall patterns and potential competitor density, using long-term (1985-2008) line-transect data. We estimated the population sizes of all species by using distance sampling. There was no effect of the year on the population sizes of all the species, but, when 5-year-period groups were analyzed, there were significant fluctuations over time intervals for at least some of the species. Generalized Linear Models on the interspecific relationships (either positive or negative) between pairs of species would suggest that interannual population size fluctuations of the various ungulates were likely attributable to fluctuations in poaching intensity, the influences of rainfall regimes (for at least three browser species), and negative density dependence.

AB Sit-and-wait predators use different strategies to encounter potential prey. Rhinoleucophenga myrmecophaga Vidal et (Vidal et Vilela; Diptera: Drosophilidae) larvae build sticky shelters on top of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) of Qualea grandiflora Mart (Vochysiaceae), a common plant in the Brazilian cerrado savanna. Although larval shelters block the EFNs, nectar production is not obstructed and is used by the larvae to attract and trap nectar-gathering ants that are eventually eaten by the dipteran. Here we describe the natural history of R. myrmecophaga, its infestation pattern in Q. grandiflora, the ant assemblage at EFNs, and the insects used as prey. We use stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of R. myrmecophaga and potential food sources to infer its diet, and perform chemical analyses of the droplets found at shelter openings to determine whether nectar is used as a prey attractant. We found that Rhinoleucophenga larvae occur on the majority of Qualea plants and occupy active EFNs mainly in the rainy season. The two most frequent visiting species were also the most common insects found trapped at larval shelters. The stable isotope analyses confirmed that ants are the main food sources of R. myrmecophaga. Chemical analyses and field observations revealed that Rhinoleucophenga larvae use extrafloral nectar to attract prey to their shelters by pushing this liquid to the shelter opening where it forms a droplet. This is a rare case of sit-and-wait predator exploiting an ant-plant mutualism through the use of the very food reward produced by the plant to attract and capture potential ant mutualists.

AB In many ant-plant mutualisms, ants establish colonies in hollow thorns, leaf pouches, or other specialized structures on their host plants, which they then defend from herbivores. Resource heterogeneity could affect the maintenance of these mutualisms if it leads to one or both partners altering their investment in the interaction. Such a phenomenon may be especially pertinent to the Acacia-ant mutualism found in East African savannas, where termite mounds have a profound effect on the spatial structuring of resources used by both plants and ants. Here, we examined whether the proximity to termite mounds of Acacia drepanolobium trees is associated with variation in the behavior of one of their ant associates, Crematogaster nigriceps. We found that ant colonies near termite mounds had decreased aggressive responses to simulated herbivory as well as increased off-tree movement. We hypothesize that these changes are the result of resident ant colonies near termite mounds shifting investment from defense of their host plant to foraging for nearby resources.

AB Protected areas such as forest reserves are often assumed to be best ways to conserve biodiversity and maintain intact ecosystems. We examined woody plant composition and diversity in the gallery forest and savannah woodland habitats of Amurum Forest Reserve and areas immediately surrounding it in Jos, Nigeria. A total of 100 10 x 10 m sample plots were established inside and outside the reserve. All woody plants >= 1cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were identified and measured. A total of 7,564 individual plants categorized as 134 species from 44 families were recorded. Overall species diversity was significantly higher in the Forest Reserve than outside the reserve, although more species were encountered outside the reserve. Our findings suggest that, protected areas and the areas surrounding them are important for the conservation of biodiversity as the areas outside protected areas also contain species of conservation value. The continuous degrading areas outside protected areas isolates them and poses a serious threat to the long-term viability of wildlife populations, so it is important that biodiversity in protected areas and their surrounding areas be conserved.

AB Previous research has shown that gut-bacterial populations in farmed abalone are shaped by ontogeny, their macroalgal diet substrates, bacteria present in the environment, and other environmental factors. It has been suggested that weaning postsettlement diatom-fed abalone onto artificial feed may alter the natural succession of bacterial establishment in their guts. The gut-bacterial composition of Haliotis midae (5-9 mm) weaned onto either a commercial formulated feed (Abfeed-S34), fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima), or a commercial formulated feed containing kelp (E. maxima) (Abfeed-S34K) was compared. The gut microbiota of postsettlement diatom-fed abalone was dominated by Planctomycetes. Weaning to kelp or formulated feed resulted in a significant difference in the gut-bacterial communities, with the Firmicutes becoming dominant in the kelp-fed treatment and the Proteobacteria dominating in the two formulated feed treatments (analysis of similarities: R = 0.77, P = 0.02). The gut microbiota of kelp-fed abalone displayed a relatively low diversity compared with that of abalone fed formulated feeds and was dominated by fermentative Clostridia bacteria. There was no difference in gut-bacterial communities of the abalone fed commercial formulated feed with or without kelp inclusion. The dominance of the Clostridia in the kelp-fed abalone guts is explained by the large volume of fermentable polysaccharides present in macroalgae, whereas the energy-rich formulated feeds appeared to reduce the selectivity of the gut environment resulting in a relatively higher bacterial diversity.

AB Foliar live fuel moisture (LFM)-the weight of water in living plant foliage expressed as a percentage of dry weight-typically affects fire behavior in live wildland fuels. In juniper communities, juniper LFM is important for planning prescribed burns and wildfire response but can be time consuming to obtain regularly. Also, there has been little analysis of the ways in which juniper LFM varies seasonally or is affected by weather conditions, soil moisture, or other variables such as drought index. Using an eight-year dataset of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei J. Buchholz) LFM observations from four sites in central Texas, USA, we found that the interannual variability of Ashe juniper LFM differs among seasons. Throughout the eight-year sample period, winter LFM fluctuated within a narrow range between about 80% and 120% and was weakly related to Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI). During summer, LFM fluctuated widely and was more strongly related to KBDI. KBDI below 315 was positively related to LFM, while KBDI above 526 was strongly negatively related to LFM. For this region, we offer a KBDI of about 500 as a threshold for fire planning, above which the potential for critically low Ashe juniper LFM becomes more likely.

AB Oil sands exploration fragments the boreal landscape by constructing numerous drilling pads to assess underground petroleum reserves. Reclamation of these pads is challenging and slow, particularly for forest understory species. We investigated the feasibility of accelerated forest understory restoration on these temporary pads by taking advantage of the propagule bank and clonal regeneration strategy of many boreal plants. We covered and protected the forest floor (FF) with subsoil during winter pad construction. This forest floor protection (FFP) method was then compared with the current practice of stripping off, stockpiling, and then replacing the FF during the reclamation phase (rollback, RB) and to conventional clearcut (CC) harvesting. In the first growing season, surface disturbance as well as richness and cover of plant regeneration was evaluated; vegetation assessment was repeated in the fifth growing season. Although there were some slight differences between the communities in the FFP and CC treatments, likely associated with varying levels of residual slash and subsoil material, there were striking differences between the communities in the RB and FFP treatments. In addition, while establishment of deciduous tree species was similar between the FFP and CC treatments, there were very few trees found in the RB treatment. The study indicates that protection and careful uncovering of the FF during temporary drilling pad construction should be a technique of choice for forest reclamation used in the boreal forest. However, as RB will still play a part in the reclamation of these sites, management intervention will be required to achieve reclamation goals.

AB Agroforestry system enhanced ant biodiversity. Ant structure in the ecosystem has been driven by many factors, e.g., competition and predation among species. Dominant species and predator may give impact to species diversity in the ecosystem. We had field research to examine the interactions among dominant ant species, predator Oecophylla smaragdina, and other ants in Tarakan, North Kalimantan. In agroforestry system as the study site, ants and other insects on 66 crop trees were collected by sweeping and beating. The obtained number of two species Tapinoma melanocephalum and Oecophylla smaragdina occupied more than 60% of all collected ants. Two dominant ants tended to be separately distributed. The community structure may be ant mosaic pattern. Furthermore, the densities of the two dominant ants were higher, but their diversities in the tree were lower than dominant species and predator absence. Probably, the tendency seems to be active on the distribution of other ants.

AB This study investigates the recent invasion of exotic grasslands by coyote brush in La Jolla Valley, California. We test the event dependent hypothesis that mechanical disturbances during the past century were a key cause. To examine the relationship between past mechanical disturbances and vegetation dynamics we first conducted a review of the historical literature on practices of shrub removal and documented disturbance history using historical imagery. We next analyzed vegetation-cover change over time using remotely sensed imagery and a vegetation map to document the history of native shrub advancement into exotic grassland by species association. Finally, we determined the topographic characteristics associated with different phases of shrub advancement. We found that mechanical disturbances historically varied by topography with upper and steeper slopes being least intensively disturbed. We found that shrub advancement rates, following release from grazing, varied by slope, elevation, and time period, and that Baccharis pilularis (coyote brush) was the main species to invade the more intensively disturbed sites at lower elevations. Our results indicate that mechanical disturbances played an important role in modifying the original vegetation cover with long-lasting consequences, including a facilitating role for the subsequent Baccharis pilularis invasion. We concluded that the practice of grazing often included exotic mechanical disturbances that had long-lasting impacts on native plants.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effects of land use on the woody vegetation composition and structure between the area within the Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) campus and the adjacent (or surrounding) area, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe. Woody vegetation was sampled in November 2014 using a total of 20 plots (10 in each stratum) delineated using a stratified sampling method. Woody vegetation species, height, basal circumference, density, evidence of tree cutting and fire damage were assessed inside all the plots. A total of 22 woody plant species (nine families) were recorded in the study area, i.e., within the CUT campus (18) and adjacent area (15) with a Jaccard Index of similarity of 43% between the two strata. Overall, 301 individuals were recorded in both strata, i.e., 57% trees, 22% shrubs and 21% seedlings. The protected area within the CUT campus had significantly (P < 0.05) higher tree density and tree basal area than the surrounding open vegetation whereas the surrounding open vegetation had significantly (P < 0.05) higher shrub and seedling densities than the protected area within the CUT campus. In contrast, no significant differences (all, P > 0.05) between the strata were recorded for tree height, shrub height, shrub basal area, species diversity and densities of tree cutting and fire damaged plants. Recorded structural differences were attributed to human influences and differing management systems across the land use systems. The findings highlight the importance of public greenery in urban landscapes (e.g., university campuses) for ex situ conservation of indigenous flora.

AB Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an exotic ladybird, first recorded in South Africa in 2004, where it was introduced factitiously. In this study the seasonal occurrence of H. axiridis and other coccinellids were monitored in four vineyards and the adjacent windbreaks over three growing seasons in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Harmonia axyridis made up the highest mean number of coccinellids collected per site over the collecting period, followed by Hippodamia variegata, Cheilomenes lunata, Exochomus flavipes and Micraspis sp. No indigenous parasitoids were observed attacking H. axyridis. The numbers of H. axyridis on the vines were negatively correlated with temperature but positively with rainfall. In view of the migration of H. axyridis from the vines in December, they appear not to pose any risk of contaminating grapes during harvest and tainting wine as most wine grapes are harvested from January onwards.

AB To estimate levels of gene flow over short distances (less than a few kilometers) in the fairy shrimp, Streptocephalus texanus, mitochondrial DNA sequences (part of the cytochrome oxidase locus) were examined in 98 individuals from 13 populations near Moab, Utah. Populations were arranged linearly along two transects on slickrock ridges, and one isolated population about 2-3 km from the others. We found six haplotypes, differing from one another by 1 to 23 nucleotides. Nucleotide diversity among the nine populations from the MiVida ridge was 0.0019 with no isolation by distance. The three populations from the Sand Flat ridge were fixed for the same haplotype, not found in other populations. The isolated population (loop B pool) contained two haplotypes, one of which was very different from others in the study. The general pattern was little differentiation among populations separated by less than about 1 km, with more differentiation at greater distances. This is consistent with passive dispersal of cysts by wind over short distances, and rare long-distance dispersal.

AB Excessive grazing pressure on rangeland vegetation reduces the basal area value of vegetation and also changes the botanic composition. This study examined the piosphere effects of livestock grazing on rangeland vegetation based on distance from a natural water source. The piosphere effects were evaluated around Karagol Lake, which is a natural water-source in Mediterranean region of Turkey. The changes in vegetation were determined within three different sites where sample plots were located at 0-1000 m, 1000-3000 m and 3000-5000 m away from the lake. The mean values of basal area in the study area were 10.71%, 14.46%, and 22.16% for three sites, respectively. The average oven-dry hay yield was 639.0 kg ha(-1), 1542.9 kg ha(-1), and 2146.3 kg ha(-1), respectively. The vegetation similarity indices of the sites indicated that the botanic composition changed with respect to increasing distance from the lake. The lowest similarity index was encountered between the site one and site three (30.31%).

AB Thirty-two specimens of the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti (Reptilia: Crocodylidae), from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, and its vicinity were examined for pentastomid parasites during 1995 to 1999 and 2010 to 2011. Pentastomid parasites occurred throughout the year and were widespread in the study area with an overall prevalence of 97% and an overall mean abundance of 23.4 (0-81). Pentastome assemblages comprised six species in three sebekid genera: Alofia nilotici Riley et Huchzermeyer, 1995, A. simpsoni Riley, 1994, Leiperia cincinnalis Sambon, 1922, Sebekia cesarisi Giglioli in Sambon, 1922, S. minor (Wedl, 1861) and S. okavangoensis Riley et Huchzermeyer, 1995. The possible influence of host age, gender and geographic location (river system) on pentastome prevalence, abundance and species richness was investigated. Generally, neither host age, gender nor locality did affect infracommunities, likely because all hosts examined were adult or subadult and displayed comparable foraging behaviour, resulting in similar exposure pathways to fish intermediate hosts. Additionally, the longevity of pentastomids would contribute to accumulative infections as hosts mature. Structuring of pentastome assemblages was observed in as far as S. minor was the dominant species based on overall prevalence and abundance, followed by the equally common species S. cesarisi and L. cincinnalis. With an overall prevalence ranging from 34% to 41% and relatively low abundances, A. nilotici, A. simpsoni and S. okavangoensis form the rarer component of pentastome communities.

DE Logistic growth; exogenous process; carrying capacity; metabolic cost
ID TUMOR-GROWTH; GENERAL-MODEL; SCALING LAWS; BIOLOGY
AB In this communication, different classes of phenomenological universalities of carrying capacity-dependent growth processes have been proposed. The logistic as well as carrying capacity-dependent West-type allometry-based biological growths can be explained in this proposed framework. It is shown that logistic and carrying capacity-dependent West-type growths are phenomenologically identical in nature. However, there is a difference between them in terms of coefficients involved in the phenomenological descriptions. Involuted Gompertz function, used to describe biological growth processes undergoing atrophy or a demographic and economic system undergoing involution or regression, can be addressed in this proposed environment-dependent description. It is also found phenomenologically that the energy intake of an organism depends on carrying capacity whereas metabolic cost does not depend on carrying capacity. In addition, some other phenomenological descriptions have been examined in this proposed framework and graphical representations of variation of different parameters involved in the description are executed.

AB Exotic species are often planted for restoration or to enhance production. Populations that expand from plantings may undergo selection in directions that differ from those produced by artificial selection prior to planting. Here, we test whether a highly productive grass, Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn., introduced to the semiarid Great Plains of North America, evolves during invasion from seeded fields into native grassland. We grew individuals of A. cristatum from six seeded populations and 12 invading populations in 12 common gardens separated by 0.5-12 km for two growing seasons. Contrary to expectations, individuals from invading populations did not have significantly greater tiller number or growth (increase in tiller number) than did individuals from seeded populations, suggesting that they have not undergone evolution towards increased invasion ability through increased size or growth. Instead, there was a general trend for individuals from invading populations to have lower growth rates and fewer tillers when grown without neighbours. Large size or high growth rates arising from artificial selection prior to introduction may be disadvantageous to populations invading semiarid grassland on dry, nutrient-poor soils. In this case, evolution may have resulted in convergence between the relatively large planted species and the smaller native species.

AB Studies on plant population demography and size structure provide important base for monitoring and managing plant species. The present study investigated the monthly variation in plant demography, population dynamics and size structure of Calotropis procera in urban areas, South Cairo, Egypt. Sixty-three permanent quadrats were selected to represent the monthly variation in the characteristics of C. procera population all over one year. The highest plant density was attained in June and the lowest in February and March. The highest biomass was recorded in November, but the lowest in March. The maximum individual's height was recorded from August to January, while the minimum was in late winter. The monthly size distribution indicated that C. procera had three different size distributions along the whole year: more or less inverse J-shape, positively skewed and bimodal size distribution. The maximum plant survival was correlated with the availability of soil moisture. The demographic flux indicated that the new branches of plant were mainly formed during April and June, followed by significant mortality in July and October. This study may contribute in planning for managing and conserving this medicinal plant.

AB In prey-predator systems where the interacting individuals are both fliers, the flight performance of both participants heavily influences the probability of success of the predator (the prey is captured) and of the prey (the predator is avoided). While the flight morphology (an estimate of flight performance) of predatory wasps has rarely been addressed as a factor that may contribute to explain prey use, how the flight morphology of potential prey influences the output of predator-prey encounters has not been studied. Here, we hypothesized that flight morphology associated with flight ability (flight muscle mass to body mass ratio (FMR) and body mass to wing area ratio (wing loading, WL)) of Diptera affect their probability of being captured by specialized Diptera-hunting wasps (Bembix merceti and B. zonata), predicting a better manoeuvrability and acceleration capacity achieved by higher FMR and lower WL, and flight speed achieved by higher WL. In addition, wasp species with better flight morphology should be less limited by an advantageous Diptera flight morphology. Overall, the abundance of dipterans in the environment explained an important part of the observed variance in prey capture rate. However, it was not the only factor shaping prey capture. First, higher prey abundance was associated with greater capture rate for one species (B. merceti), although not for the other one. Second, the interaction observed between the environmental dipteran availability and dipteran WL for B. zonata suggests that greater dipteran WL (this probably meaning high cruising speed) decreased the probability of being captured, as long as fly abundance was high in the environment. Third, greater dipteran FMR (which likely means high manoeuvrability and acceleration capacity) helped to reduce predation by B. merceti if, again, dipterans were abundant in the environment. Wasp WL only varied with body mass but not between species, thereby hardly accounting for interspecific differences in the wasps' predatory patterns. However, the greater FMR of B. zonata, which implies better flight performance and greater load-lifting capacity, may explain why the capture rate in the two wasp species is affected by different factor interactions. In conclusion, although prey availability remains the primary factor shaping prey use, prey flight morphology seems to gain an additional role under conditions of abundant prey, when wasps can avoid flies with better flight ability.

ID FRAMEWORK; COMPONENT
AB Significant efforts have been recently devoted to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of resilience in engineering systems. Current resilience evaluation methods, however, have mainly focused on business supply chains and civil infrastructure, and need to be extended for application in engineering design. A new resilience metric is proposed in this paper for the design of mechanical systems to bridge this gap, by investigating the effects of recovery activity and failure scenarios on system resilience. The defined resilience metric is connected to design through time-dependent system reliability analysis. This connection enables us to design a system for a specific resilience target in the design stage. Since computationally expensive computer simulations are usually used in design, a surrogate modeling method is developed to efficiently perform time-dependent system reliability analysis for resilience assessment. System resilience assessment is then investigated based on the developed time-dependent system reliability analysis method. The connection between the proposed resilience assessment method and design is discussed through the sensitivity analysis and component importance measure. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience assessment method and the associated sensitivity analysis and component importance measure.

DE Resilience; cultural landscapes; identity; risk assessment
AB Cultural landscapes can be interpreted as geographical spaces with high sensitivity. The pressure of urbanization, or alternatively, the abandonment of wide rural areas as a secondary consequence of the same process of urbanization, in these high fragility territories determines serious environmental crises. The high density of values, such as landscape (natural or man-made) quality of landscapes, ecosystem services production, concentrated presence of resources, is constantly threatened not only by climate change but also above all by the same urbanization processes. It can talk about 'landscape risk' when these urbanization processes determine changes that cause loss of identity of landscape values. Here, resilience is the ability of an ecosystem (or more precisely, a socio-ecological system) to adapt by virtuous change its internal relations and maintaining the identity values. The paper explores the potential of a method of analysis and evaluation in which, starting from the recognition of the heritage elements, the system of values are compared with the conditions of risk and degradation (due to environmental and man-made drivers) with the result of building maps of vulnerability and resilience.

DE landscape; memory; history
AB Landscape memory is a very common term today and its usage is various. The term is usually connected with social sciences as ability of organisms to save and use information about previous experience. One of the possible explanations is a memory as composition of biotic and abiotic components. Even in this situation the information is the main term. The saved information here is the result of landscape history and particular place. Land changes in the past determine the nowadays-local basic characteristics. Each change creates and saves this information. Afterwards they influence possibilities of particular place and limit its usability. Landscape memory is comparable to the mechanical system that reacts to stimuli term from external environment without changing inner organization. This information is written down as a palimpsest with the whole history of the place. The specific place,,remembers" the history and the present, tolerates only specific land use and returns landscape to the previous conditions or trends after the wrong usage.
   Suitable land use provides a good basis for ecosystem services. The example could be meandering and subsequent straightening of rivers, deforestation, relocation and change in soil layers. These changes in the past affected the present management and it is important to identify them. We can use these archival materials: the maps of the 2nd and 3rd (II and III) military mapping, basic maps and other maps and historical aerial photographs. Landscape memory is needed to be respected during the landscape planning and we have to learn the landscape history, the saved information and the memory of particular place thoroughly. Key words: landscape; memory; history.

AB Our knowledge of why animals orientate in specific directions is less than for any other type of distribution; this is especially true for intertidal organisms. Understanding the behaviour of intertidal organisms on vertical/near-vertical surfaces is important as the relative abundance of these surfaces will increase with elevated sea levels. Orientation by marine organisms is a fundamental behaviour, but most studies have addressed environmental influences on orientation. It is equally true that habitat properties, intraspecific interactions and intrinsic individual variation will be important. Populations of the limpet Cellana tramoserica exhibit a downwards bias in orientation on steeply sloped substrata (> 60A degrees), but orientation varies among individuals. We tested whether differences in orientation are explained by inter-individual behavioural variations, in a population examined for 4 months in each of 2 years. Significantly, more limpets than expected consistently orientated downwards ("downwards facing limpets") and additionally the majority of limpets were consistently found on steeply sloped substrata. The number of "downwards facing limpets" we found was not sufficiently large enough to completely explain population-level patterns of orientation, as only 8 % of limpets consistently faced downwards compared to 39 % of a population facing downwards at any given point in time. Also, individuals that consistently occupied steeply sloped substrata were no more likely to orientate downwards than others. We suggest that intrinsic inter-individual variation among limpets influences orientation. The temporal variation in individual orientation observed emphasises the requirement for adequate temporal replication in experiments before proposing causal explanations.

AB Although indigenous to southern Africa, Pechuel-loeschea leubnitziae is considered a problematic weed as it forms dense monotypic stands in the grasslands and woodlands of the Okavango Delta, Botswana, and is associated with veld degradation and a dominance of shade-tolerant, poor-quality grass species. Generalised linear modelling was used to determine the effect of the following environmental conditions on the likelihood of occurrence of P. leubnitziae: type of land use, vegetation type, burning history, total woody species density, soil pH and soil texture. There was no difference in P. leubnitziae presence under wildlife, large livestock and small livestock land use (p = 0.227). Only vegetation type (p < 0.001) and total woody species density (p < 0.001) significantly affected P. leubnitziae occurrence, with the species being rare in dense mopane woodlands and most likely to occur in mixed thornveld and mixed broadleaf woodland, although this likelihood decreased with increasing total woody species density. A single burn had no effect on P. leubnitziae occurrence, but repeated burning should be investigated as a means to reduce the vigour and recoppicing success of P. leubnitziae.

AB Artificial artesian wells have existed in the San Luis Valley of south central Colorado for over 100 years, and they are an important source of water for livestock and wildlife. When Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (GRSA) expanded its boundaries in 2000, ten of these wells were within the new park boundary Because the habitat surrounding the wells was so severely disturbed by cattle and wildlife trampling, the National Park Service capped the wells in 2010 to promote restoration of the areas to a more natural state. To study changes after well-capping, we compared the plant communities in 2011 and 2012. We measured and compared plant cover, species frequency, and species diversity at recently capped wells on GRSA, at flowing wells (i.e., with water) on adjacent private lands of The Nature Conservancy, and at reference sites. In general, there was little difference in percentage of plant cover and species diversity between well types. For percent cover, annual variation and distance from wellheads were the best predictors for the native and exotic plant species, respectively. Plant species composition varied by well type, with reference sites having the greatest frequency of native plants per site and capped well sites having the greatest frequency of exotic plants per site. For native plants, reference sites had the highest species diversity, while capped wells had the highest community evenness. Overall, our results suggest that in the short term, native plant populations have changed little after well-capping, but the frequency of exotic plants has increased at capped well sites relative to reference sites.

SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY

AB Management often bases decisions on estimates of animal density and population size. Aerial sampling is expensive whilst current ground methods, noticeably Distance sampling, assume a single detection function for each habitat and that visibility in a given habitat type declines in a smooth, increasing manner with distance from the observer. If the visibility within a habitat varies widely or is suddenly cut off, as amongst abrupt topography, these assumptions are invalidated. We present an affordable, accessible and accurate method for conducting repeated annual censuses on large herbivores in such terrain. We used a GIS habitat-based approach. Monthly, over a two year period, we conducted repeated road transects in Ithala Game Reserve, South Africa, using GPS to record the geographic position of each sighting. These records (n=8742) were then imported into a GIS and overlaid onto an existing habitat-type GIS layer. With the sampled area thus defined as an irregular polygon in the GIS encompassing all records, we calculated densities of each herbivore species by habitat type and extrapolated total population size estimates. Estimates of maximum population size for wildebeest and zebra correlated (+/- 15%) with management's estimates based on aerial surveys, walked transects and experience. White rhino are individually counted in the reserve and our estimates (year 1: 52; year 2: 57) matched these known numbers (year 1: 50; year 2: 53). Our method also yielded realistic numbers for impala, but unrealistic numbers for kudu and warthog. Our GIS-based census technique produced realistic maximum population estimates for abundant grazing and mixed-feeder mesoherbivores and for scarce, but highly visible, megaherbivores, but not for cryptic species. With the increasing availability of GIS data, the technique is recommended to those working in abrupt terrain frustrated by the inability of current ground census techniques, principally Distance sampling, to produce realistic population estimates.

AB Here I examine how conservation organizations responded to a crisis environment in Zimbabwe. Since c. 2000 Zimbabwe has gone through a political, social and economic crisis that has led to reduced support for, and in some cases disengagement by, international and regional conservation organizations. I explore five response types on a continuum of disengagement and propose lessons for wider conservation practice. The lessons include the need to recognize that political discourse often excludes biodiversity conservation and therefore any conservation decisions based on political expediency run the risk of impeding conservation progress. Progress in conserving biodiversity requires sustained investment regardless of changing political circumstances. Such investment should include support for institutional development, local engagement, and accountability that engenders ownership of local conservation initiatives. I conclude that conservation organizations must take a long-term view of conservation and commitment to enhance conservation outcomes. This kind of engagement must be adaptive instead of based on a wait-and-see attitude or other forms of disengagement, as has been seen in Zimbabwe. Conservation organizations that disengage do so at the risk of further loss of biodiversity in some of the most biodiverse but unstable places.

AB In targeted radionuclide radiotherapy, the relationship between bone marrow (BM) toxicity and absorbed dose seems to be elusive. A compartmental model of mouse thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis was set up to predict the depletion of hematopoietic cells as a function of the irradiation dose delivered to BM by injected radiopharmaceuticals. All simulated kinetics were compared with experimental toxicity for several stages of differentiation of the 2 hematopoietic lineages. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were injected either with (FNa)-F-18 (37 and 60 MBq), a bone-seeking agent, or with saline. BM mean absorbed doses were calculated according to the MIRD formalism from small-animal PET/CT images. Hematologic toxicity was monitored overtime, after (FNa)-F-18 injection, by studying BM progenitors and precursors in addition to blood cells. The compartmental model takes into account the pharmacokinetics of the compound, in addition to cellular kinetics and cell radiosensitivities for the 2 studied lineages. Results: Because biodistribution studies showed an uptake of (FNa)-F-18 in bones, the skeleton was considered as the principal source organ of BM irradiation. The time-activity curve obtained from validated quantification of PET/CT images allowed for the calculation of mean absorbed doses to the whole BM of 2.1 and 3.4 Gy for (FNa)-F-18 injections of 37 and 60 MBq, respectively. Concerning hematologic toxicity, the model was in good agreement for the 2 absorbed doses with experimental measurements of cell depletion for platelets, progenitors, and precursors within the BM in terms of time to nadir, depletion intensity, and time to recovery. The same agreement was obtained for red blood cells and their precursors. Model predictions demonstrated that BM toxicity was in correlation with the mean absorbed dose as higher depletions at nadir and longer delays to recovery were noticed for 3.4 Gy than for 2.1 Gy. Conclusion: The developed compartmental model of thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis in a BM toxicity context, after internal irradiation, allowed for the prediction of cell kinetics of BM progenitors, precursors, and mature blood cells in a dose-dependent manner. This model could therefore be used to predict hematologic toxicity in preclinical internal radiotherapy to study the dose-response relationship.

AB The aim of this three years study was to analyze and compare the richness, composition, abundance and observed frequency of anuran amphibian assemblages in the two forest fragments, Phufoilom (a protected area) and Phuhinlat (a non-protected area), both in the upper northeastern Thailand. The study was the first survey of the anuran amphibian assemblage in these forest fragments. Four Sampling techniques were used which are the visual encounter surveys (VES) using the time constrained count (TCC) technique, the sampling plots, the stream transects and the pitfall-trapping. The Chao-Jaccard Similarity Index was used for the comparison of species richness and composition among habitat types and fragments. Both fragments were very similar in anuran richness and composition, being composed of 5 families representing 15 genera (28 species) in Phufoilom and 13 genera (26 species) in Phuhinlat. However, the differences in richness and composition between habitat types were found within each fragment. Of the 28 species, 26 were shared in both forest fragments. In the protected area 22 anuran species were captured in higher rate than in non-protected, significant differences in 11 species. In addition, relative abundance among species followed a similar pattern within both areas. These results confirm the critical function of habitat in maintaining appropriate population size and proportion of abundance among species in an assemblage.

AB Hunting is an important basis for conservation, but hunters are surprisingly scarce in global networks of environmental advocacy and governance, and hunting management systems are not given the attention they should receive. This article reveals the messages promoted by hunting advocates through an analysis of museum representations and interviews in order to understand the limitations of and basis upon which further integration of hunters into conservation advocacy circles worldwide could occur. Museums feature representations that reflect the cultural elucidations of their host organization. This article will show how the International Wildlife Museum maintained by Safari Club International produces messages of the inseparability of humans from nature, purposive management of nature, dependence upon global capitalism and predation, and the neutrality of scientific knowledge. Through these messages a narrative space for the management of wildlife is produced that attempts to unite the commodification and conservation of nature, namely, "sustainable hunting". This article concludes by identifying contradictions among the messages of sustainable hunting that may limit hunting advocates' ability to work with other stakeholders to further improve hunting management systems.

AB The "Ernesto Tornquist" Provincial Park (ETPP) is located inside the Ventania system (Argentina) and was created to protect one of the last relicts of pampean grasslands. Even though many studies have looked at the vertebrate faunal diversity, biology, and conservation in this Park, few studies have been dedicated to arthropods. Among these, spiders have been used as ecological indicators to evaluate nature conservation status, nevertheless, basic information on their distribution and ecology is necessary for their use as indicator taxa in this region. Thus the goal of this study was to present the phenology and demography of the spider Odo bruchi, a cursorial spider present in the ETPP. For this, spiders were sampled bimonthly using pitfall traps between September 2009-2010 (first year), and March 2011-2012 (second year). A total of 10 traps were placed every 10m along a transect of 100m parallel to the longest axis of a grassland slope with native vegetation. Traps were filled with 1 500mL of ethylene glycol, that were examined and refilled every 60 day period. We collected a total of 799 specimens in two years. Juveniles were the most abundant reaching 47.8% of the total, while males corresponded to 27.8% and females 24.4%. We found significant differences in the mean abundance of O. bruchi: the abundance during spring-summer (Nov-Dec-Jan-Feb) was significantly higher than the other periods of the two years period. Moreover, we found an even abundance distribution throughout the year in the entire study. This work represents one of the first contributions to the ecology of this spider family in the area. Also, our results comprise relevant information to encourage future studies on this spider species as a bio-indicator of the conservation status of pampean grasslands.

AB The association of the swollen-thorn acacia (Acacia cornigera) and ants is an example of defensive mutualism. It has been shown that some bird species prefer to nest in myrmecophyte acacias, suggesting that their nests are protected from predators by the associated ants. Based on previous knowledge regarding the existence of extended benefits for birds in the acacia ant interaction, the role of the rufous-naped wren was analyzed within the ant acacia system. Nest predation was assessed taking into account tree species with and without myrmecophytic interactions, tree cover and height, the presence and abundance of ants, predator type, and the distance between each nest and the closest myrmecophyte acacia. The probability of survivorship of artificial nests using a known fate analysis was calculated. The results showed non-significant differences in the probability of survivorship regardless of the presence and density of myrmecophyte acacias, tree cover and height, the presence and abundance of ants, or predator type. Interestingly, the highest degree of predation in the artificial nests was related to the rufous-naped wren. These results suggest that the acacia ant bird interaction is more complex than previously perceived.

AB The main aim of the conducted research was to determine the presence of invasive plant species in the protected natural area of the Bojcin Forest Nature Monument. Floristic and vegetation study of the Bojcin Forest was conducted through several vegetation periods (from March 2009 to November 2011). The presence of 185 plant species recorded in the area of the Bojcin Forest reflects its flora richness. Out of the total number of recorded species, 31 taxa are listed as invasive plant species (Table 1), which makes 16.76% of the total flora of the Bojcin Forest Nature Monument. Among them, there are nine woody plant species and 22 herbaceous plant species. Among the tree species, Amorpha fruticosa L. should be particularly emphasized. It forms a thick shrub formation by the Jarcina Canal with reed [Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.] (Fig. 1). Also significant is the presence of the species Symphyotrichum lanceolatum (Wild.) Nesom, forming an edge of width of 4 m between forest and meadow where the all other plant species were repressed (Fig. 2). The greatest number of determined invasive plant species belong to the family Asteraceae (eight species), then to the families Fabaceae and Rosaceae (three species each), Amaranthaceae and Oxalidaceae (two species each), whereas the other families had a single invasive species each.
   During the 2011 year, insect fauna in the area of the Bojcin Forest was studied, with special emphasis on economically important species. It was found that the Bojcin Forest is inhabited by a total of 93 insect species. Among them, very significant are ground beetles (family Carabidae), especially some of them acting as predators of many insect pests. Ground beetles were registered in the Bojcin Forest with total of nine species and three subspecies. Three ant species were registered in the researched area of the Bojcin Forest. Some ground beetles and ants have been proved as a good group to reduce numbers of certain weed species, as they use seeds of these pests as the food. These insect species may be used in biological control of some harmful invasive plants.
   Research results should provide a basis for development of strategies for monitoring the state of unwanted species and planning measures of their reduction in order to protect the autochthonous flora. Only careful and responsible management of the natural area would maintain the abundance of these species at the current level.

TI Tree size but not forest basal area influences ant colony response to
   disturbance in a neotropical ant-plant association
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Ant-acacia mutualisms are conspicuous biotic associations in Savannah and neotropical ecosystems; however, the effects of tree size and forest structure on ant behaviour and tree traits are rarely examined. We tested two hypotheses related to these effects: (1) ant responses to disturbance are influenced by tree size and forest basal area; and (2) tree traits important to ants are predictable by tree size and forest basal area. We investigated these hypotheses in a dry tropical forest (Ometepe Island, Nicaragua) with the myrmecophytic Collins acacia (Vachellia collinsii Saff.) and the ant Pseudomyrmex spinicola (Emery 1890). We measured trees from three size classes and three basal area classes and quantified resources that are important for ants, including food resources (nectaries and Beltian bodies) and domiciles (thorns), as well as a measure of potential tree reproductive fitness (seedpods). We also evaluated ant responses to experimental disturbances. Three important findings emerged: (1) on average, 1140-1173% more ants responded to experimental disturbances of large trees than small- or intermediate-sized trees, respectively; (2) forest basal area did not affect ant responses to disturbance; and (3) neither tree size nor forest basal area was correlated with branch-level mean numbers of nectaries, food bodies or thorns. Our studies support the hypothesis that tree size is an important factor regarding ant behavioural responses to disturbance, but not forest basal area. Our work suggests that future studies of ant behaviour on myrmecophytes should consider tree size.

AB The condition of pastoral resources of a land of reception and transit for transhumant herders: the Kotchari territory (Southeastern Burkina Faso). - Kotchari pasturelands, which include a portion of the W National Park, were characterized by three complementary methods: an analysis of a colour composition of an Aster image, a floristical analysis and a pastoral survey. Nine pastoral landscape units with diverse tree cover were described, they include ten agrostological groups. The landscape units located outside the protected area, especially on thin to fairly deep soils, show the highest density in ligneous species and the highest herbaceous richness as well as the least dominance between species. Conversely, herbaceous phytomass and ligneous cover are higher in the protected area, particularly on the deep hydromorphic soils units. In addition, these units are more or less heterogeneous, some containing several agrostological groups. In general, the pasture lands located outside the protected area tend to be the most degraded: in some of them there is a regeneration of trees and a decrease of perennial herbaceous species. In all, although the phytomass is rather abundant and the pastoral values are acceptable in most units, those located outside the W park appear not very interesting in terms of pastoral use. Their ability to produce herbaceous regrowth after vegetation fires is low, the landscape is highly fragmented and the access to some units is not possible all year long. The pastoral status of the pastoral units inside the protected area, which have the highest phytomasses and the best pastoral values, is clearly much better. The strong interest of transhumant herders in this region seems guided on the one hand by the quality and availability of forage that is better at the end of the dry season than in their home grazing territory, and on the other hand by the opportunity of illegal use of pastoral resources in protected areas.

AB The study was conducted in nine 150-L capacity glass aquaria for 192 h to determine the changes in the microflora in the gut and hepatopancreas of tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, after bioaugmenting (water treatment and probiotics). Results showed that luminous bacterial counts were significantly lower in bioaugmented than in nonbioaugmented systems (range 0-5.9 x 10(3) cfu/g and 0-3.2 x 10(3) cfu/g in gut and hepatopancreas, respectively). Biochemical tests of isolates showed that the bioaugmented systems were dominated by Gram-positive Bacillus and Streptococcus and the Gram-negative Vibrio dominated the control. In water-treated and probiotics-fed bioaugmented system, the change in bacterial dominance to Bacillus became evident 2 h in the gut and 24 h in the hepatopancreas. Bacterial dominance shifted to Vibrio species after 120 h. Shrimp in the control were observed to become lethargic after 72 h as Vibrio species significantly increased in number. Dissolved oxygen and unionized ammonia levels were significantly lower in bioaugmented system compared with the control.

AB Census and monitoring of the population of lions (Panthera leo) in Zakouma National Park (Chad). - The "Zakouma Lion Study" started at the beginning of 2003 with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the hitherto little studied lions (Panthera leo) of Central Africa, since they appear more and more threatened by the diminishing natural habitats and the concurrent increase of threat from humans. The zone selected for the study corresponds roughly to the Eastern half of the National Park of Zakouma (NPZ) - a nature reserve situated in the South-East of Chad - and covers an area of approximately 1500 km(2). It includes most of the permanent bodies of water in the park, and sustains the majority of the fauna in the NPZ during the dry season. The "Zakouma Lion Study" took place in the dry season, from April 2003 to June 2006, and its objectives were as follows : to identify the population of lions, to analyse their diet, to assess their state of health, to study the human-predator conflict on the periphery of the park, and to train local agents in lion monitoring. The size of the NPZ lion population has been calculated by using individual recognition and "call-in" techniques. Estimated at about 140 (with 63 having been recognized individually), the population could be considered as being small, but in all likelihood it forms part of a meta-population within which genetic exchanges are possible. Five lions were equipped with VHF radio transmitter collars, then radio-tracked by air and ground to gather the information on the social structure, the reproduction and the predation of the NPZ lion population. The areas preferred by these five lions during the dry season and their evolution according to time were identified. The rate of female reproduction and the demographic characteristics of the population correspond to that which has been recorded elsewhere. The survival rate of the lion cubs seems moreover most satisfactory. Three coalitions of resident males and one apparently solitary resident male, covering the territory of at least five prides, were identified within the study boundaries between 2003 and 2006. Nonetheless, the organizational behaviour of these lions in the NPZ seems to differ somewhat front that of the classic scheme of leonine organization, as was described by Schaller (1972). The direct observation technique of predation is unanimously considered as the method of choice to determine the lions' diet with precision. However, due to the density of vegetation limiting visibility and the surveillance by vehicle in the study area, we weren't able to use that method. In place of this, we made use of the technique of opportunistic observation, which gives a good idea of the dietary habits of the carnivores, but tends to lead to an overrepresentation of the large prey. The elephants (Loxodonta africana), buffalo (Syncaller brachyceros), the hartebeest (Alcephalus buselaphus lelwel) and the waterbuck (Kobus ellipsyprimnus defassa) are all among the species the predation of which was most observed in the study zone. The first three listed here are equally those species most represented in the park. Blood samples were taken from those lions being anaesthetized in order to collar them, and were then the subject of biological analysis.
   The viruses associated with canine distemper, feline immunodeficiency virus infection, feline panleukopenia virus infection, feline calcivirus infection, feline peritonitis infection and pleuritis, feline leukaemia virus, and feline viral rhinotracheitis virus infection were all reseached. The analyses did not reveal any threats on the health status of the NPZ lion population. Various methods were employed to evaluate the importance of the threat of human/predator conflicts in the periphery of the NPZ study area. Among these, there was an enquiry into the predation of domestic livestock and the means put in place by the transhumant and sedentary breeders belonging to eleven villages and six nomadic encampments on the periphery of the park. If the predation of livestock is seen to be a regular problem in several villages and numerous nomadic encampments, the consulted group of breeders seems to consider the problems linked to predation as slight compared with the problems of illness or theft. The different activities of the "Zakouma Lion Study" were brought together working with "Volet Suivi Ecologique" of the CURESS Project (the European project in charge of the NPZ area at the time of our study) and its different agents were formed through a practical and a theoretic instruction by the different techniques of taking inventory and of following the lions in the park.

ID CARRYING-CAPACITY
AB Assessment of population carrying capacity is a key task in the reconstruction planning of areas struck by disasters, in which the precision of estimation is required. This study developed a decision-making model for estimating the population capacity of the involved townships and cities in the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake based on the assessment of the suitability for reconstruction of the areas. Through analysis, arable land resources were argued to be the critical constraint of population capacity in these areas. Then, the spatial differentiations of the post-quake development conditions across different regions were analyzed with respect to their natural environments, socio-economic development and quake damages. The expected levels of urbanization, family incomes and income structures, output levels of land, and the reliance of agricultural population on arable land were estimated by different regions. With these parameters, the population capacities of the involved townships and cities in three scenarios were estimated. The total population capacity of the entire areas is abundant compared with the actual post-quake population; however, the status of over-population substantially varies across space. It was suggested to put the emphasis of post-quake resettlement policy on those counties where earthquake had been the main causes of over-population. In the Full Recovery Scenario, three mountain counties were identified including Wenchuan, Beichuan and Maoxian, with a total over-population of about 100,000 people.

ID NEW-ZEALAND; DISPERSAL; OCEAN; CIRCULATION; LIMPETS; GROWTH; SCALES
AB For many sessile subtidal and intertidal organisms, the connection between isolated adult populations occurs through oceanic dispersal of the larval stage. We define the 'temporal kernel' as the normalised frequency histogram of oceanic dispersal times between otherwise isolated populations, and suggest minimum dispersal times are best defined in terms of a percentile of the temporal kernel. Under certain assumptions, larval dispersal in the ocean can be treated as Gaussian-distributed random-walk motion in the presence of a mean flow. If this is so, the dispersal time is analogous to the 'first-passage time' as described by Schrodinger (1915: Phys Z 16:289-295), and the temporal kernels are described by the inverse Gaussian function. Here, solutions for the temporal kernel are derived for such a model. The solutions for the percentiles of the temporal kernel are exact, but solutions for mean and standard deviation values exist only in the limit of large island separation. The exact and approximate solutions are compared for random walks representative of realistic oceans, and the sensitivity of the temporal kernel to uncertainty in the eddy diffusivity is evaluated.

AB On the rehabilitation of a severely degraded site formerly occupied by cloud forest, the impact of five experimental tree species assemblages on some soil chemical properties and plant performance was explored. Seedlings of ten native cloud forest succession tree species and the exotic species Casuarina were combined in five assemblages of different composition and richness. Their effect was noticeable on five out of eight soil properties analyzed The one that included Casuarina stood out on height, and had the highest levels of most of the nutrients, particularly nitrogen. More than half of the trees sown remained alive after the initial two years of the experiment (1999 and 2001). Assemblages affected individual survival time as well as growth variables. Plant cover was most rapid and extensively formed by the native species assemblages; those that included oaks, showed high levels of some nutrients. The richest assemblage displayed intermediate levels in soil and plant variables. The inclusion of the rapid growth species Casuarina was validated to enhance nutrient accumulation on degraded soils. The results suggest that initial rehabilitation can be achieved by the assemblage establishment.

AB Many marine organisms are fixed or highly sedentary as adults but the adult population may be strongly dependent on the oceanic transport of planktonic larvae. In order to assess interactions between oceanographic and biological processes that determine the population dynamics of marine organisms with a sessile adult phase restricted to the coastline and a planktonic larval phase, we present a stage-structured finite element model for the barnacle Balanus glandula that inhabits the rocky intertidal zone of central California, USA.
   The larval dispersal depends on knowing the flow pattern. To this end, we develop a numerical procedure to couple physical and biological models in a very simple way when the velocity flow field is known on some discrete values in the domain of interest and at a given time. We investigate the effects of different flow patterns and velocity speeds on the abundance and the distribution of this organism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is devoted to develop some "ad-hoc" Control Theory formalism useful for the famous Beverton-Holt Equation arising in population dynamics. In particular, the inverse equation is redefined for a finite set of consecutive samples under the equivalent form of a discrete linear dynamic system whose input sequence is defined by the sequence of carrying capacity gains and the unforced dynamics is directly related to the intrinsic growth rate. For that purpose, the environment carrying capacity gains are allowed to be time-varying and designed for control purposes. The controllability and stability properties of the dynamic system associated with the Beverton-Holt inverse equation allow extrapolate in a simple dual way the above properties to the standard Beverton-Holt equation.

AB Changes in the seasonal rhythm of two plant phytocoenoses in a submountain beech forest during secondary succession were studied. Investigations were done on four monitoring plots with different stand density over the period of four successive years. The rhythm of the associations Dentario bulbiferae-Fagetum and Carici pilosae-Fagetum reflects the course of succession processes running six years after the human impact (cutting) in the ecosystem. Results of the phenological observations of the, understorey species with the focus on the changes in flowering and colour spectrum allowed to make the comparisons between both associations in connection with different phyto-climatic conditions and in dependence on time. The most conspicuous changes in the seasonal rhythm and structure of the examined associations were found in conditions of the former clear-cut, currently in succession phase. A clear decrease (56%) in number of taxons with the dominance > 1% in one association towards the end of the 4-year study period was detected here. Simultaneously, a decrease in the number of flowering species was observed, while the relative rate of species being in the vegetative stage increased considerably (from 6 to 67%) over the growing season. The course of flowering of both of the associations missed discernible trends and peaks as well as colour spectra were partially changed during four monitored successive years on the formerly unstocked area.

AB Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) synthesizes crystalline inclusions that are toxic to caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and other orders of invertebrates. Materials associated with 37 caterpillars from 16 species, collected while feeding on 15 different species of host plants in dry, cloud and rain forests located in the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica, were examined for the presence of Bt. From a total of 101 derived samples, 25 Bt isolates were cultured: 56% from host plant leaves, 8% from caterpillar guts and 36% from caterpillar fecal pellets. Bt was isolated from at least one sample in 38% of the systems constituted by the food plant, gut and fecal pellets corresponding to a single caterpillar.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of wood cutting and collecting on vegetation around informal settlements in the south-eastern Cape coastal zone. Thicket and Afromontane forest vegetation were selectively sampled at Kenton-on-Sea, Port Elizabeth, Plettenberg Bay and Knysna, using a fence-line approach, in combination with transects. The floristic data were then ordinated using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Certain notable changes in vegetation structure and floristics were evident. Wood cutting and collecting increased species richness, diversity and heterogeneity in thicket vegetation and it would appear that thicket tolerates current levels of utilisation. On the other hand, both species richness, diversity and heterogeneity decreased in forest near informal settlements, suggesting that forest is not adapted to cope with such impacts.

AB In February 2004 the 7(th) Conference of the parties for the Convention on Biological Diversity recommended the implementation of a set of indicators to measure progress towards the 2010 and 2025 target of significantly reducing the loss of terrestrial and marine biological diversity. Collaboration between local, national and international networks is now currently being formed to measure these indicators and the resulting success of investing conservation practices into threatened areas. By measuring changing levels in the status of biodiversity, at interrelated ecological scales, the conservation community can better evaluate the success of conservation action.
   Analogous to the terrestrial system we hypothesise that satellite remote sensing instruments are potentially very useful tools for detecting change in the distribution of key coastal habitats and thus can be applied to monitor the spatial degradation of coral reefs, sea grass beds, mangroves and kelp forests. Using cost-effective platforms accompanied by superivsed classification and images processing tools, we believe that there is an opportunity to utilise these systems to measure the status of marine habitats on a national, regional and global scale of effort. Remote sensing tools will continue to increase in accuracy, decrease in cost and become more accessible to the conservation community. As this happens the opportunity to overlay global habitat survey images in a time series manner will become greater.

ID EVOLUTION; TRADE; WEEDS
AB Literature on plant invasion is reviewed. There has been a degree of success in explaining why some plants are more invasive than others within certain groups of species (e.g. pines, woody plants) and a wide range of characters has shown correlation with invasiveness in individual surveys, Few characters have proved to be of consistent predictive value but one of the most useful appears to be weedy/invasive behaviour elsewhere, Based on these types of data, various models have been proposed, to assess the risks from introduction of plant species, and one of these has been officially adopted in Australia, This type of model has utility when applied to limited numbers of individual species, e.g. those proposed for introduction as crops or ornamentals, It is less useful for identifying potential invaders among the large numbers of the world's weedy (and previously non-weedy) species which might be introduced accidentally, A project to address this problem for USA is described which resulted in a list of over 600 potential invasive weeds which could not be readily assessed individually in such a detailed manner, A procedure for ranking these species is under development, so that the highest-ranking can then be subjected to detailed assessment. It is feared, however, that many potential invasives will still have been overlooked, Of over 100 troublesome alien weeds in USA, only 1 in 4 had proved seriously weedy in agriculture elsewhere and many had not been recorded as weeds at all, in any context. Some of the reasons why weeds become more invasive in a new environment are reviewed, and it is concluded that the characteristics involved, in the species and in the invaded habitat, make their invasiveness largely unpredictable, or only predictable with enormously increased knowledge and research. Thus if weeds are known to be aggressive elsewhere it is feasible to predict the likelihood of their invasiveness when introduced, but there will be many other invasions which defy prediction for the foreseeable future.
   Once a species is predicted to be invasive and listed as a prohibited species under quarantine regulations, chances of introduction can be very much reduced. The mechanisms for preventing the entry of listed species are briefly reviewed, It is almost inevitable, however, that there will still be many unpredicted, un-prevented invasions, some due to accidental introduction but especially from plants deliberately introduced for cultivation, often after a long lag phase. The continuing difficulty of predicting these occurrences means that education and awareness are immensely important, to ensure that invasive behaviour is recognised early and that there is a policy and mechanism for rapid response and containment and/or eradication.

AB Theoretical basis of ecologo-floristic classification according to Braun-Blanquet approach is discussed with the special attention to the contribution of Russian scientists. Principal results concern presentation of vegetation continuum in discrete classification units: polymodal conception of plant communities, principle of plural syntaxonomic decisions, pragmatic approach to classification, method of homological rows of plant communities, etc. Current ecologo-floristic classification of vegetation in Russia consists of 77 classes. This system is a good basement for estimation of rarity of plant communities and biodiversity protection. The first variant of "Red Book" of plant communities of Russia and other eastern European countries is discussed.

AB First- and second-instar mantids given small amounts of food (similar to prey availability in the field) attained a smaller size and spent more time in those developmental stages than mantids offered as much as they could eat.  In two of three cohorts, mantids reared during the first stadium on a low quantity diet recovered during the second stadium when they were switched to a high diet, by having a higher relative consumption rate, gaining as much weight as and spending less time in the second stadium than those reared on the high diet throughout.  Consequently, in two of three mantid cohorts, mantids switched from low to high quantity diets weighed as much at the end of the test as those reared continuously on the high quantity diet.  When deprived of food just after emergence in another experiment, relative growth rate of mantids given a low diet over the first stadium was unimpaired until the third day without food.  In contrast, mantids deprived of food for 2 d and then given a high diet had a high relative consumption rate and the highest relative growth rate, a consequence of fewer days spent in the first stadium.  In a third experiment in which three treatments consisted of the same total number of prey per day but presented in different sequences and thus having different prey densities, prey density affected consumption of flies and consumption by mantids was high when prey density was high.  However, relative growth rate was similar among treatments, which may reflect distracted mantids at high prey densities.  These results show that mantids can compensate under some conditions for short-term food deprivation and effects of local prey density by increased consumption rate, and thus can develop more quickly.

AB Invasive grasses have spread over large areas of ancient savannas worldwide and have extensively impacted native landscapes in the neotropics. However, our understanding on how the displacement of native by invasive grasses may affect tree-grass coexistence in neotropical savannas is still poor. The present study tested the imposed effects of an invasive grass (Urochloa brizantha) and a native grass (Paspalum atratum) on survival rates, stem growth and biomass of seedlings of six native tree species representative of savanna physiognomies of the Cerrado biome. We conducted experiments under field conditions subjected to experimental manipulations of light, water supply and fertilization. Considering that grass performance might be reduced by shade, and that irrigation and fertilization might relax competition between grasses and tree seedlings for water and nutrients, respectively, we postulated that these treatments would modulate the effects of the grasses on tree seedling survival and growth. We found that both grass species reduced tree seedling survival, and the effects were not alleviated by shade, irrigation, or fertilization. The presence of either native or invasive grasses reduced seedling stem length, irrespective of fertilization and shade. Irrigation alleviated the negative effects of both grasses on stem length. Both grass species reduced seedling biomass, irrespective of light conditions, irrigation, or fertilization. The impacts imposed by the invasive grass on the tree seedlings were larger than those imposed by the native grass, indicating that the displacement of native by invasive grasses can strongly affect recruitment potential of tree species. Due to the extent of grass invasion in neotropical savannas, and its potential impacts on recruitment patterns of native trees, adequate policies and management plans are needed to control invasive grass spread to conserve native biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB 1. The mesopredator release theory predicts that the density of subordinate predators will increase as dominant predators decline. Persistent debate around mesopredator release in part reflects the lack of robust, replicated experiments that test this theory, and the use of population indices that confound changes in mesopredator density and detectability. This uncertainty has immediate impacts for conservationists who are faced with managing sympatric invasive predators. 2. We used replicated experimental designs and spatially explicit models to examine whether mesopredator release of the feral cat Felis catus occurs in response to targeted control of the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes. We surveyed three Control-Impact paired landscapes in a region with long--term fox control (1080 poison baiting) and conducted a Before--After Control--Impact Paired--Series experiment in another region. We used fox occurrence as a simple metric of fox populations and estimated feral cat density with spatial mark--resight models. 3. Lethal fox control had varying effects on fox occurrence, consistent with variation in the duration and intensity of poison baiting. Correspondingly, responses in feral cat density ranged from negligible to a 3.7--fold higher density in fox--baited landscapes. At a fine spatial scale (200 m(2)), feral cat density was negatively associated with fox occurrence probability across both regions. These results were consistent with mesopredator release, although uncertainty was high in the region where fox control had only recently commenced. 4. Feral cat detectability also varied across the (artificially manipulated) gradients of fox occurrence probability. In one region, nonlinear models indicated that feral cats had lower detection and increased movement rates when foxes were uncommon, giving way to density suppression at high fox occurrence probabilities. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides replicated, experimental evidence that dominant predator suppression can be associated with a higher mesopredator density. Mesopredator release can manifest as changes in both behaviour and density, distorting inference if these processes are not distinguished. Our results may help explain why fox control does not consistently improve native prey persistence, suggesting integrated pest management may be necessary to improve conservation outcomes.

AB In restoration ecology, the Field of Dreams hypothesis posits that restoration efforts that create a suitable environment could lead to the eventual recovery of the remaining aspects of the ecosystem through natural processes. Natural processes following partial restoration has led to ecosystem recovery in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. However, understanding the efficacy of a "Field of Dreams" approach requires a comparison of different approaches to partial restoration in terms of spatial, temporal, and ecological scale with what would happen given more comprehensive restoration efforts. We explore the relative effect of partial restoration and ongoing recovery on restoration efficacy with a dynamical model based on temperate rocky reefs in Northern California. We analyze our model for both the ability and rate of bull kelp forest recovery under different restoration strategies. We compare the efficacy of a partial restoration approach with a more comprehensive restoration effort by exploring how kelp recovery likelihood and rate change with varying intensities of urchin removal and kelp outplanting over different time periods and spatial scales. We find that, in the case of bull kelp forests, setting more favorable initial conditions for kelp recovery by implementing both urchin harvesting and kelp outplanting at the start of the restoration project has a bigger impact on the kelp recovery rate than applying restoration efforts through a longer period of time. Therefore, partial restoration efforts, in terms of spatial and temporal scale, can be significantly more effective when applied across multiple ecological scales in terms of both the capacity and rate for achieving the target outcomes.

AB 1. Increase in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in freshwater ecosystems as a consequence of anthropogenic activities is a matter of public health concern. Although researchers have looked at ARG abundance and the factors affecting them in biofilms, water and sediment, the role of freshwater macroinvertebrate gut microbiomes in harbouring and disseminating ARGs is unknown. In the cur- rent study, we tested whether: (a) macroinvertebrate gut microbiomes serve as hotspots of ARGs in comparison to their immediate environment, (b) functional feeding groups (FFGs) impact ARG abundance in macroinvertebrate guts, (c) bacterial community composition and ARG abundance are correlated, and (d) mac- roinvertebrates can be potential vectors of ARGs.2. Macroinvertebrates, sediment and water samples were collected from seven different sites along northeastern Ohio (U.S.A.) streams and abundances of three ARGs (sulI, sulII and tetW) were determined. Bacterial community composition also was examined for respective microbiomes and a microcosm study was de- signed for testing hypothesis 4.3. In many cases, the gut microbiome had higher relative ARG abundance (sulI and sulII) at sites along Tinker's Creek compared to the surrounding substrate and water. ARG abundances along with taxonomic differences in bacterial commu- nity composition were different among the FFGs (ARG abundance higher in om- nivores). Certain bacterial taxa were significantly correlated with one or more ARGs. We did not find that freshwater macroinvertebrates can serve as vectors of ARGs (from the microcosm study).4. Overall, our site- based results suggest that freshwater macroinvertebrate guts may serve as reservoirs of ARGs, differences in ARG abundance among FFGs was possibly a result of differences in bacteria ingested and gut morphophysiological conditions.5. Because this study indicates that macroinvertebrate guts can be potential reservoirs of ARGs, future studies can be designed to understand the role of macroin- vertebrates in dissemination of ARGs in freshwater ecosystems.

AB Climate change, land degradation, demographic change and persistent poverty pose major challenges to smallholder farmers in the arid and semi-arid lands of sub-Saharan Africa. Though many studies have focused on how resilient these households are to shocks, very few studies deal with how household resilience varies over time. We provide a longitudinal analysis to assess how the resilience of smallholder households in south-eastern Kenya has varied from 2012 to 2015. We use the Livelihood Resilience Indicator Framework to examine the linkages between livelihood outcomes and livelihood resilience (buffer capacity, self-organization and capacity for learning). We collected data from 134 households on three resilience dimensions: buffer capacity, self-organization, and capacity for learning. We performed principal component analysis to identify the key components of these dimensions and examine their relevance for livelihood outcomes. Our findings show that under drought conditions in 2012, conservation agriculture practices significantly contributed to maize yields. In both years 2012 and 2015, there was a positive correlation between resilience dimensions and food security. Key components of this relation were land area, income, conservation agriculture practices, climate forecasts and actions taken for the upcoming growing season.

AB Aim: We assess the role of contemporary oceanography and species traits in shaping observed patterns of biogeography over broad spatial scales.
   Location: Our study domain covers the east and west coasts of North America, from 30 degrees to 73 degrees N on the east coast and 33 degrees to 73 degrees N on the west coast.
   Time period: Hydrodynamic models use climatological fields from 1990 to 2015 on the east coast, and 1993 to 2018 on the west coast.
   Major taxa studied: Model simulations represent larval dispersal for generalized benthic invertebrate species distributed in the subtidal zone from 10 to 100 m depth, with planktonic larval durations ranging from 21-60 days.
   Methods: We conducted a literature review to identify major biogeographic barriers along the east and west coasts of North America, and then assessed the permeability of these barriers to larval dispersal using Lagrangian particle tracking. We ran a series of simulations in which we varied the suitable habitat distribution, planktonic larval duration, and spawning seasonality of simulated larvae (i.e., particles) to assess the effects of species traits on biogeography.
   Results: Our results showed a strong alignment of observed biogeographic barriers with larval dispersal patterns, with high variation in barrier permeability depending on the traits of the species considered. The location of suitable habitat and the season during which particle release occurred were the biological traits that drove much of the variation in barrier permeability among simulations on both coasts.
   Main conclusions: Our results indicate an important role of contemporary oceanographic and geographic features in determining the biogeography of species whose primary dispersal is during larval stages, suggesting that climate change is likely to alter patterns of species biogeography. Our results also demonstrate that species traits play a strong role in determining the location and strength of biogeographic barriers.

AB Landscape approaches are gaining momentum in both scientific and policy agendas. However, landscape approaches comprise a multitude of concepts, approaches and principles, which are in part similar, in some parts different or even contradictory. In this paper, we used a Q-method questionnaire to explore how landscape approaches are understood and employed in 45 case studies of socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes derived from the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI), as well as the motivations for employing them. Our analysis revealed that all landscape approaches pursued very similar goals, namely to ensure that local communities as landscape stewards have the capacity to preserve context-specific values in the face of socio-economic and environmental changes. The tools for reaching such goals are built upon people and nature feedback dynamics that crystalize in rich biodiversity and local ecological knowledge. However, our analysis also showed that the means to reach those goals differed depending on many contextual factors, such as the dominant ecosystems and socio-economic activities in the landscape, the constellation of actors or the most relevant drivers of change affecting the social-ecological system. In particular, we identified four distinct lenses in which landscapes approaches are applied in practice to landscape sustainability: (1) for the preservation of natural values, (2) for the preservation of socio-cultural values, (3) for the promotion of social justice and participatory governance, and (4) for securing food security and local livelihoods. Our results showed an association between the choice of a lens and the value types motivating the use of a landscape approach. Relational values were associated with a focus on landscape conservation and safeguard of social-ecological values. Our study highlights the relevant and beneficial role of landscape approaches as a boundary concept and emphasizes the need for transdisciplinary and participatory methods within landscape research and practice to navigate the context-specific options for implementation of landscape approaches.

AB Ecosystem services are fundamental to people and are undergoing many threats such as uncontrolled fire. Local knowledge has been widely used to guide management decisions for plant biodiversity. Therefore, we assessed the knowledge of the people of Pendjari Biosphere Reserve (PBR) on the impact of fire on ecosystem services (ES). A semi-structured questionnaire with three fire impact levels (no, low and high) was used to interview 150 randomly selected households in four ethnic groups. The generalised linear model (GLM) was performed on the relative frequency of quotations to assess the effect of ethnic group, age and sex for each impact level of fire on ES and also to test the interaction among the considered factors. The local people reported that uncontrolled fire causes damage to many provisioning ES. The local knowledge concerning the impact of fire on ES was affected significantly (p < 0.0001) by ethnic group, age and sex irrespective of the impact level of fire on ES. Moreover, there was no significant interaction among the considered factors. The studied factors are benchmarks to be integrated into awareness and preservation measures of ES to mitigate the impact of uncontrolled fire practices in the study area.

AB The impacts of species invasions can subside over time as ecosystems 'adapt' and invaders decline or increase over time as additional species invade. The character and timescales of invasion impacts provide important insights into ecosystem dynamics and management. Yet long-term studies of invasion impacts remain rare and often confound invasive species impacts with coincident environmental change. One way to address this challenge is to ask: what ecological changes over time since invasion are recapitulated in ecosystems that span a range of conditions, are located in different regions, and were invaded in different decades? We synthesize many-decade time series across seven ecosystems to resolve shared changes in seven key ecosystem features following invasion by zebra mussels and subsequent invasion by quagga mussels. These two congeners are among the most widespread invasive species that re-engineer and increasingly co-invade freshwater ecosystems. Seven polymictic shallow lakes with long-term data sets reveal remarkably similar trends, with the strongest ecosystem impacts occurring within 5-10 years of zebra mussel invasion. Surprisingly, plankton communities then exhibited a partial, significant recovery. This recovery was absent, and impacts of initial invasion amplified, in four lakes where quagga mussels outcompeted zebra mussels and more completely depleted phytoplankton. Thus, we show that the ecosystem impacts of invasive species can subside over time but amplify with serial introductions of competing, even closely similar, taxa.

AB Understanding drivers of demand for exotic pets may help inform adequate conservation strategies to address unsustainable trade. Here, we used a best-worst scaling approach to understand the variety of preferences and motivations for owning exotic pets. Respondents (316 from 33 countries) preferred exotic pets that were captivebred, had rare aesthetic features, and were common in the wild and abundant in the market. Species that were at risk of extinction, in short supply, sourced from the wild, and under trade restrictions were the least favoured by respondents. Feelings of care, such as attachment, affection, nurture, as well as curiosity and being passionate about the species, were dominant motivations for pet keepers. Respondents were willing to support the conservation of species in the wild. Our findings highlight that relational dimensions are among the most important aspects influencing decisions to own exotic pets. Certification systems of origin that supports animal welfare and conservation may help consumers support sustainable trade in exotic pet species. However, attention should be paid to challenges throughout the supply chain and not to incentivize consumers' preferences for rare genetic features as this may pose a risk to the conservation of species in the wild. When planning conservation initiatives and policies, considering relational dimensions may provide novel insights to better foster meaningful expressions of care with animals in the wild, as opposed to animals as exotic pets. Fostering care, as a normative human sense of kinship with non-humans, could help channeling "demand for ownership" towards "stewardship relations" with nature.

AB Bet-hedging is an ecological risk-aversion strategy in which a population does not commit all its effort toward a single reproductive event or specific environmental condition, and instead spreads the risk to include multiple reproductive events or conditions. For aquatic invertebrates in dry wetlands, this often takes the form of some propagules hatching in the first available flood, while remaining propagules hatch in subsequent floods (the "hedge"); this better ensures that a subset of propagules will hatch in a flood of sufficient duration to successfully complete development. Harsh environmental conditions are believed to promote an increased reliance on bet-hedging. Bet-hedging studies have typically been restricted to single sites or single populations. Community-level assessments may provide more robust support for the range of hatching strategies that exist in nature. Here, we tested whether freshwater zooplankton assemblages inhabiting ephemeral and unpredictable wetlands of a semiarid zone of tropical Brazil employ hatching strategies suggestive of bet-hedging; few efforts have addressed bet-hedging in the tropics where the unique conditions may influence the strategy. We collected dry sediments from six ephemeral wetlands, and flooded them across a sequence of three hydrations under similar laboratory conditions to assess whether hatching patterns conform to some of the predictions of the bet-hedging theory. We found that taxa showing hatching patterns akin to bet-hedging associated with delayed hatching numerically dominated the assemblages that emerged from dry sediments, although there was large heterogeneity in the hatching rate among sites and across taxa. While some populations distributed their hatching across all three floods and committed most of their hatching fraction to the first hydration, others committed as much or more effort to the second hydration (the "hedge") or the third hydration (another substantial "hedge"). Thus, in the harsh study wetlands, hatching patterns akin to bet-hedging associated with delayed hatching were common and occurred at multiple temporal scales. Our community assessment found that a commitment to the "hedge" was greater than the current theory would predict. Our findings have broader implications; bet-hedger taxa seem especially well equipped to tolerate stress if conditions become harsher as environments change.

AB Biophysical models often require shelf-scale domains to map larval dispersal over several weeks, presenting a computational challenge. This can be overcome by decreasing model spatial resolution; however, nearshore processes, which potentially play a significant role in larval dispersal, will inevitably be unresolved. Here, we evaluate how simulated larval dispersal in the nearshore is sensitive to model spatial resolution. We use an unstructured, finite element, hydrodynamic model of a topographically-complex coastline in North Wales, UK (which includes headlands, bays and channels) at four different spatial scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m) to compare the influence of spatial resolution on transport and dispersal patterns of particles released within the nearshore region (within 1 km of the shore). In the higher resolution (50 and 100 m) simulations, particles generally travelled offshore more quickly and further (-18%) than in the coarser (250 and 500 m) simulations. This had important implications for potential connectivity along the coast: for the lower resolution simulations, retention of particles near source sites was increased by -50% and, whilst the magnitude of connectivity among discrete regions along the coast was also increased (by -27%), the number of connected regions was reduced (by -9%), compared with the higher resolution simulations. Our results, based on a case study in a highly energetic and topographically complex region, suggest that model spatial resolution of <= 100 m should be used for dispersal studies in the nearshore zone. These findings add to growing evidence of the importance of using appropriately scaled models when simulating the transport of material within - and out of - the coastal zone, with many applications, such as marine ecology, marine biosecurity, marine spatial planning and marine pollution.

AB The distribution of the White-Lipped Frog Amnirana albolabris was long assumed to extend from eastern-central to western African rainforests. However, recent molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that this taxon likely represents several undescribed species. Because the name-bearing types were collected in Gabon, the distantly related West African populations clearly represent an undescribed species that partly occurs in sympatry with Amnirana fonensis. Based on an integrative taxonomic approach, including molecular, morphological, and acoustic data, we describe the 'albolabris' populations from the Upper Guinean Forest Zone as a new species, and redescribe the morphologically similarA. fonensis on the bases of a larger series of genotyped individuals, including the first known females. We also provide new biological information for A. fonensis, including their advertisement call, habitat, and reproductive data. The new species is sister to A. fonensis and the two species differ by 5.8% in the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Morphologically, males of the new species are smaller and have relatively smaller humeral glands. Females of the new species seem to have shorter legs than A. fonensis. In comparison to A. fonensis, the advertisement call of the new species has a higher dominant frequency and more pronounced frequency modulation. The two species differ in their distribution and habitat preferences, as revealed by environmental niche modelling. Whereas the new species is restricted to the Upper Guinean forests and thus is a true lowland-rainforest inhabitant, A. fonensis lives predominantly in Guinean montane forests in the forest-savanna mosaic zone.

AB Siphonosoma australe, Phascolosoma arcuatum, and Sipunculus nudus are three important sipunculan species in tropical intertidal zones. In this study, the particle size, organic matter content, and bacterial community composition in the gut contents of three different sipunculans and their surrounding sediments were analyzed. The grain size fractions of sipunculans' guts were significantly different from those of their surrounding sediments; particle size fractions < 500 mu m were favored by the sipunculans. As for the total organic matter (TOM), higher contents of organic matter were observed in the guts than in the surrounding sediments in all three sipunculan species. The bacterial community composition of all the samples was investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, in which a total of 8974 OTUs were obtained from 24 samples based on a 97% threshold. The predominant phylum identified from the gut contents of three sipunculans was Planctomycetota, while the predominant phylum in their surrounding sediments was Proteobacteria. At the genus level, the most abundant genus was Sulfurovum (average 4.36%) in the surrounding sediments, while the most abundant genus was Gplla (average 12.76%) in the gut contents. The UPGMA tree showed that the samples from the guts of three different sipunculans and their surrounding sediments were clustered separately into two groups, which showed that these three sipunculans had a different bacterial community composition with their surrounding sediments. The grain size and total organic matter (TOM) had the greatest impacts on the bacterial community composition at both the phylum and genus levels. In conclusion, the differences in particle size fractions, organic matter content, and bacterial community composition between the gut contents and surrounding sediments in these three sipunculan species might be caused by their selective ingestion.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by woody legumes is likely to vary due to factors such as nutrient availability, fire and grazing. BNF may also alter soil properties by increasing soil fertility, consequently affecting rates of soil respiration. Given the widespread increase in woody plant density in southern African savannas, we investigate the factors influencing BNF in a common encroaching woody legume, Vachellia sieberiana. We conducted a pot experiment using a matrix of grass and seedlings of V. sieberiana. We then assessed the effects of increased nutrient availability (nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P)) through fertilizer addition, as well as simulated fire and grazing on the rate of BNF, the number and weight of root nodules, and soil respiration. We found a significant decrease in BNF with fertilizer addition, and increases in BNF after fire application. Soil respiration increased with fertilizer addition and decreased after fire application. Grazing had no independent effect on any of the response variables. However, decreased grass biomass, and therefore reduced competitive interactions between tree seedlings and grasses, resulted in increased BNF across all treatments. Furthermore, we found that larger woody seedlings achieved higher rates of BNF, with a positive correlation between the rate of BNF and both the number and weight of root nodules. We conclude that BNF in V. sieberiana is facultative and strongly influenced by grass competition, with differing responses to varying environmental factors. Fertilizer addition suppresses BNF because the presence of readily available N negates the costs of fixation. V. sieberiana seedlings compensated for N lost by fire application by increasing BNF. Soil respiration was found to increase with fertilizer addition, possibly due to higher carbon (C) inputs into the soil. Conversely, fire reduced soil respiration by removing biomass, and thus reduced C input into the soil.

AB In biologically diverse ecosystems, an essential process to support competing species to coexist is ecological differentiation. Habitat heterogeneity is, hence, important in establishing species abundance and richness, favoring the coexistence of species due to habitat partition. In this context, shading and species thermal tolerance can be good factors to elucidate the role of habitat heterogeneity in the habitat partition among closely related species. Herein, we study shading effects in microhabitat selection, behavior, and physiological limitation on two species of fiddler crabs (Leptuca leptodactyla and Leptuca uruguayensis). Indeed, shading conditions influenced fiddler crabs species proportion over time, with L. leptodactyla more associated with nonshaded/warmer areas while the L. uruguayensis to shaded/cooler ones. They also adjusted their behavior differently from each other to deal with thermal stress. Finally, we have demonstrated that these effects are related to species' physiological limitations. We conclude that biologically diverse ecosystems, such as intertidal regions from estuaries (e.g., mudflats and mangroves), support the coexistence between closely related species by reducing competition due to habitat partition.

AB (1) Background: With the economic development and population change, the unique village ecological structure in plain and lake areas is facing various threats. This study aims to explore ways to increase the stability of the rural ecological space and promote the construction and development of green and livable villages from the perspective of spatial resilience. (2) Method: The framework for the assessment of spatial resilience for villages was constructed, the spatial resilience characteristics in Qing Yanggang were analyzed through a field investigation and qualitative analysis, and a spatial resilience planning path for the village in river and lake areas was established. (3) Results: By integrating the natural and artificial elements in rural space, the rural spatial resilience planning can reduce the sensitivity, vulnerability and potential risks of rural areas, which is an important strategy to improve rural sustainable development. (4) Conclusions: For rural areas in plain and lake areas, it is important to optimize rural land use structures, divide rural ecological resilience zones, establish ecological zoning control systems, implement water system connectivity, improve water system patterns to achieve ecological restoration, and implement the adaptive cycle of rural water ecosystem to form a rural spatial resilience planning model. In this way, the Goals n.6 of "Provide Water and Sanitation" of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can be achieved at the rural scale.

AB Density estimates for animal populations often inform conservation and management decisions. Many methods to estimate animal density exist but deciding between competing alternatives traditionally has depended upon assessing multiple factors (e.g., precision, total cost, area sampled) independently and often in an ad hoc manner. Cost-effectiveness analysis is a tool that economists use to decide objectively between competing alternatives. We extend cost-effectiveness analysis to simultaneously integrate precision and per-area cost of sampling when selecting between competing techniques used to estimate animal density both after a single application of a method and across several applications of capital equipment. Our extension allows for weighting of factors that may vary with the objectives and constraints of decision makers. We apply our extension of cost-effectiveness analysis to a case study in which population density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was estimated in 3 large management units in Indiana, USA, using 3 competing distance-sampling methods: fecal-pellet, camera-trap, and aerial sampling. The unweighted cost effectiveness of aerial sampling with color and infrared sensors was usually superior after a single application of each method and was always superior across several applications in differing landscapes. Pellet sampling was the most cost effective after a single application of each method in an agriculturally-dominated management unit. Although camera sampling has increased in popularity, the cost effectiveness of camera sampling was poorer than the other 2 methods, even when allowing for potential future innovations to streamline data processing. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be useful when selecting among competing methods for monitoring animal populations of conservation and management importance. The same principles used in our cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to decide between competing alternatives related to any ecological monitoring in addition to density estimation.

AB A range of conservation and restoration tools are needed to safeguard the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. Aquaculture, the culturing of aquatic organisms, often contributes to the numerous stressors that aquatic ecosystems face, yet some aquaculture activities can also deliver ecological benefits. We reviewed the literature on aquaculture activities that may contribute to conservation and restoration outcomes, either by enhancing the persistence or recovery of one or more target species or by moving aquatic ecosystems toward a target state. We identified 12 ecologically beneficial outcomes achievable via aquaculture: species recovery, habitat restoration, habitat rehabilitation, habitat protection, bioremediation, assisted evolution, climate change mitigation, wild harvest replacement, coastal defense, removal of overabundant species, biological control, and ex situ conservation. This list may be expanded as new applications are discovered. Positive intentions do not guarantee positive ecological outcomes, so it is critical that potentially ecologically beneficial aquaculture activities be evaluated via clear and measurable indicators of success to reduce potential abuse by greenwashing. Unanimity on outcomes, indicators, and related terminology will bring the field of aquaculture-environment interactions into line with consensus standards in conservation and restoration ecology. Broad consensus will also aid the development of future certification schemes for ecologically beneficial aquaculture.

AB The variability of annual precipitation and grazing are primary drivers shaping the structure and function of plant communities in grasslands. Yet it remains unclear on a mechanistic understanding of how annual precipitation and grazing affect the plant community structure, function, and their linkage via direct or indirect pathways. We measured the plant community structure (plant traits, species abundance, and plant diversity), total aboveground biomass, total cover, and species covers in plant communities in responses to annual precipitation variability from 2014 to 2017 and grazing pressure comprising 0, 0.93, 1.82, and 2.71 sheep ha(-1) in a desert steppe. Two-way ANOVAs, ordinary least square regressions, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to test the impacts of annual precipitation variability and grazing pressure on the plant community structure and function. Results showed that higher annual precipitation of 2016 and 2017 increased the relative abundances of forbs; grazing pressure increased the relative abundances of dominant grasses [Stipa breviflora Griseb. and Cleistogenes songorica (Roshev.) Ohwi], but decreased those of subdominant forbs (Convolvulus ammannii Desr. and Artemisia frigida Willd.). Plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen concentration, regulated plant species abundance directly or indirectly via affecting sheep diet selection. Annual precipitation variability and grazing pressure independently regulated plant diversity, aboveground biomass, and total cover, which the former had larger effects. There was slower decrease in grass biomass than that in forb biomass with increasing grazing pressure, indicating that dominant grasses are resilient to grazing but subdominant forbs are sensitive due to their distinct difference in sward palatability. The positive correlation between plant diversity and aboveground biomass was driven by both annual precipitation variability and grazing pressure. These highlight direct and indirect (via traits and abundances of plant species) effects of annual precipitation and grazing in shaping the structure and function of desert steppe ecosystems.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in wildlife surveying, including estimation of population densities. It is essential that we evaluate and test new survey methods to guide optimal sampling strategies. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of using a UAV-mounted thermal infrared (TIR) camera to count red deer Cervus elaphus populations, and how this was influenced by flight season, height and velocity, in order to help guide future census design. We flew 57 flights across a captive population of red deer in a 13 ha deer park enclosure of semi-natural habitat, representative of the species' range in northern Germany. Flights and image assessments were performed with no prior knowledge of actual population size. Accuracy was quantified by comparing real population size (known only to deer park staff) and independently estimated population sizes from UAV TIR images. Accuracy was significantly influenced by ecological season (early and late winter, spring and early summer) and height. Across all seasons, lower flights (100 m) performed better than higher ones (120 m), with lower flights in early winter and early summer being on average accurate to within 1% of actual population counts. For the season where we had the largest range of temperatures between flights (late winter) we found that accuracy was highest when temperatures were lowest. Flights were also able to identify all five stags (defined as a male deer >= 2 years old) present in early summer, but not in spring. Deer appeared to avoid the landing/take-off area, but there were no noted behavioural responses to drones flying over animals when at constant height and velocity during surveys. Our results indicate that UAV-mounted TIR camera have the potential to accurately count populations of large ungulate species, but that flight season, height and potentially temperature need to be taken into account to maximise accuracy. This approach has the potential to be scaled up to more accurately estimate densities of wild populations compared to existing approaches.

AB Quantitative 'completion criteria' agreed between mining companies and regulatory authorities are typically used to assess restoration outcomes. Completion criteria provide the basis for determining whether mining companies have fully met their obligations for site restoration. Relationships among potentially conflicting criteria, particularly around site productivity (e.g., timber production), the return of biodiversity, long-term ecosystem trajectories and other ecosystem services remain poorly understood during the development of mine restoration. For the jarrah forest of southwest Australia, we manipulated site productivity in post bauxite mine restoration by establishing four initial Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) tree stocking rates in factorial combination with seeding a range of large N2-fixing understorey legume species. We measured jarrah growth rates over the 32-year duration of the experiment, soil-N concentrations at 3 and 32 years-of-age and understorey plant species rich-ness and cover at 15 and 32 years-of-age. Stand basal area over bark (BA) increased with increasing tree stocking rates. However, there was a significant negative effect of increasing stand BA on understorey plant cover and species richness. These negative effects were still significant 32 years after the commencement of the experiment. Seeding large understorey legumes increased total soil-N. However, this did not increase tree growth. Rather, seeding large legumes reduced tree survival and diameter at breast height, and reduced understorey species richness, even though the applied seed mix in the large legume treatment contained 14 more species compared with the control. Our data highlight trade-offs between individual aspects of restoration success, such as tree stocking rates and understorey species richness. Further these results suggest reducing site productivity, by the judicious use of large understorey legumes and establishing low tree stocking rates, may facilitate the return of diverse vegetation communities. Finally, it is important to recognise that when restoration success is viewed through the lens of one-dimensional metrics such as completion criteria, restoration may function as a 'zero-sum game' in which a gain for one outcome (e.g., N2-fixation) may result in a loss to one or more other outcomes (e.g., tree growth and species richness).

AB Pabellon de Pica, Tarapaca, Chile, is a former guano mine exploited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Guano is in a direct contact with Cu sulfide mineralization leading to the formation of minerals with a highly unusual chemical composition, especially Cu-organic complexes and nitrogen-bearing phases. In this work, we report results of the Raman spectroscopic investigation of several unique Cu-bearing minerals that are the result of supergene processes at the Pabellon da Pica site. We focus on several minerals with new and interesting structure types which were described from this locality for the first time, namely, antipinite (K-Na-Cu oxalate), ammineite (Cu ammine complex), chanabayaite (Cu ammine triazolate complex), and joanneumite (Cu isocyanurate). The Raman spectra contain specific bands attributed to the characteristic vibrations of the molecular groups present in the minerals (oxalate, ammine, triazolate, and isocyanurate groups) and vibrations within Cu-centered polyhedra. A comparison was made with the vibrational spectra of related minerals and synthetic phases, which revealed substantial proliferation and shifting of numerous bands, which is in agreement with the complex composition of the investigated minerals. The results obtained appropriately complement known structural and spectroscopic data published previously.

AB Earth observation (EO) data, derived from remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), have been recently demonstrated to be essential tools for the ecosystem monitoring and habitat mapping, combining high technological and methodological procedures for applied ecology. However, research based on EO data analyses often tend to focus on image processing techniques, neglecting the development of a detailed sampling design scheme needed for an exhaustive habitat detection. This paper shows the results of a novel approach for mapping coastal dune habitats at a fine scale, using a supervised machine learning model, through the combination of vegetation plot sampling scheme, synergic use of multi-sensor spectral imagery (UAV-VHR) and environmental predictors (e.g., LiDAR), object-based image analysis, and landscape metrics analysis. Proposed approach was tested in a protected area, established to preserve notable habitats along the Italian Tyrrhenian coast. A detailed sampling scheme was designed and carried out during spring and summer of 2019, combining simultaneously UAV flight acquisition and field vegetation survey data, collected at high precision positioning. The calibrated classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 78.6% (standard error 4.33), allowing us to accurately classify and map five coastal habitats, according to EUNIS (European Nature Information System) classification, which were further verified through a fully independent validation field survey. Results demonstrate that VHR imageries, combined with specific field survey schemes, can be exploited to train classification models used for the detection of plant communities (i.e., meso-habitat) and plant species at local scale. Our findings demonstrate that UAV-VHR data is a valid tool to produce high spatial resolution information in sand beach ecosystems, giving ecology research a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective ecosystem monitoring.

AB Context. Manned aerial surveys are an expensive endeavour, which is one of the core reasons for insufficient data coverage on wildlife monitoring in many regions. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a valid, cost-efficient alternative, but the application of UAVs also comes with challenges.Aim. In this explorative simulation study, our aim was to develop an efficient layout of UAV surveys that could potentially overcome challenges related to double counts of individuals and even area coverage, and that would minimise off-effort travel costs.Methods. Based on different simulated survey layouts we developed hypothetically for the Katavi National Park in Tanzania, we quantified the advantages that UAVs might offer. We then compared these findings with manned aerial surveys.Key results. The proposed new survey design and layout indicated an increase in survey efficiency of up to 21% when compared with conventional survey designs using parallel transect lines. Despite the complex flight pattern, the accuracy of the flight paths of the UAV outcompeted those of manned aerial surveys. The adapted survey layout enabled a team of two operators with a small battery-powered UAV to cover an area of up to 1000 km(2) per day, without specific infrastructural requirements.Conclusion. Our calculations may serve as a vital spark for innovation for future UAV survey designs that may have to deal with large areas and complex topographies while reducing operational effort. Implications. UAV applications, if well designed, provide useful complementation, if not replacement, for manned aerial surveys and other remotely sensed data collections. Our suggested survey design is transferable to other study regions, and may be useful for applying UAVs efficiently.

AB The successful establishment of European lobster (Homarus gammarus) land-based production is hampered by the high mortality rate during larval development, which can be partially explained by the proliferation of pathogens in the communal tanks commonly used for larval rearing. Therefore, disinfection water treatment could improve the low survival rates frequently recorded in H. gammarus farming. In this study, we evaluated the effect of UV irradiation on the microbial abundance and physicochemical quality of the culture water, as well as on H. gammarus larvae growth and survival reared on a flow-through system for a period of 15 days. Results showed that UV treatment significantly decreased the microbial abundance and reduced the variation in water parameters but did not improve physicochemical water quality (turbidity, ultraviolet transmission, nitrogenous compounds, biochemical, and chemical oxygen demand). Moreover, contrary to the expectations, UV irradiation did not improve but slowed down larvae growth. We initially hypothesized that UV disinfection would enhance the rearing water quality by inactivating bacteria, including potential pathogens, and hence, benefit larvae growth and survival. Our findings suggest that UV disinfection can stabilize the rearing environment but does not benefit H. gammarus larvae rearing, at least in a flow-through system set-up. This could be due to UV disinfection eliminating not only potential harmful pathogens but also other microbial groups important for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota supporting lobster larvae growth.

AB Sea lice are a threat to the health of both wild and farmed salmon and an economic burden for salmon farms. With a free-living larval stage, sea lice can disperse tens of kilometres in the ocean between salmon farms, leading to connected sea louse populations that are difficult to control in isolation. In this paper, we develop a simple analytical model for the dispersal of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) between two salmon farms. From the model, we calculate the arrival time distribution of sea lice dispersing between farms, as well as the level of cross-infection of sea lice. We also use numerical flows from a hydrodynamic model, coupled with a particle tracking model, to directly calculate the arrival time of sea lice dispersing between two farms in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, in order to fit our analytical model and find realistic parameter estimates. Using the parametrized analytical model, we show that there is often an intermediate interfarm spacing that maximizes the level of cross-infection between farms, and that increased temperatures will lead to increased levels of cross-infection.

AB IntroductionForestry in many parts of the world depends on exotic species, making this industry a source of invasions in some countries. Among others, plantations of the genus Pinus, Eucalyptus, Acacia, Populus, and Pseudotsuga underpin the forestry industry and are a vital component of many countries economies. Among woody plants, the cosmopolitan genus Acacia includes some of the most commonly planted trees worldwide. In order to prevent, manage and control invasive plant species, one of the most used tools is species distribution models. The output of these models can also be used to obtain information about population characteristics, such as spatial abundance patterns or species performance. Although ecological theory suggests a direct link between fitness and suitability, this link is often absent. The reasons behind the lack of this relationship are multiple. Chile is one of the countries where Acacia species, in particular, A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon, have become invaders. MethodsHere, we used climatic and edaphic variables to predict thepotentially suitable habitats for A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon in continental Chile and evaluate if the suitability indices obtained from these models are associated with the observed performance of the trees along the country. ResultsOur models show that variable importance showed significant similarities between the variables that characterize each species' niche. However, despite the high accuracy of our models, we did not observe an association between suitability and tree growth. DiscussionThis disconnection between suitability and performance can result from multiple causes, from structural limitations, like the lack of biotic interactions in the models, to methodological issues, like the usefulness of the performance metric used. Whatever the scenario, our results suggest that plans to control invasive species should be cautious in assuming this relationship in their design and consider other indicators such as species establishment success.

AB The widely used species-occurrence-based models that predict the realized climate niche of plants can be too restrictive and do not reflect among-population variation in assessing climate change impact and guiding assisted migration for adaptation to future climates. To mitigate this deficiency, this study built a fundamental climate niche model for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) based on 20-year tree height from wide-ranging provenance trials as a case study. The model was built through comparisons and optimizations of two candidate models, universal response function (URF) and universal transfer function (UTF), with linear and linear mixed-effect forms, against varying sample sizes based on the comprehensive provenance trials. We found that URF and UTF models had similar performances, while URF models were more straightforward in identifying optimal provenances for planting sites. Linear mixed-effect models did not show clear advantages over linear models in our case but prevented including additional predictors, which are often critical. We selected the linear model of URF and predicted the fundamental climate niche of lodgepole pine on a global scale and revealed a great potential of using this species for climate change adaptation beyond its native distribution, representing a significant step in forest genecology. Our study presented a new approach for assisted migration at the species and the population levels to optimize adaptation and productivity under a changing climate.

AB Eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana is encroaching into new habitats, which will affect native ecosystems as this species competes with other plants for available resources, including water. We designed a greenhouse experiment to investigate changes in soil moisture content and rooting depths of two-year-old J. virginiana saplings growing with or without competition. We had four competition treatments: 1) none, 2) with a native tree (Quercus stellata), 3) with an invasive grass (Bromus inermis), and 4) with both Q. stellata and B. inermis. We measured soil moisture content over two years as well as root length, total biomass, relative water content, midday water potential, and mortality at the end of the experiment. When J. virginiana and B. inermis grew together, water depletion occurred at both 30-40 cm and 10-20 cm. Combined with root length results, we can infer that J. virginiana most likely took up water from the deeper layers whereas B. inermis used water from the top layers. We found a similar pattern of water depletion and uptake when J. virginiana grew with Q. stellata, indicating that J. virginiana took up water from the deeper layers and Q. stellata used water mostly from the top soil layers. When the three species grew together, we found root overlap between J. virginiana and Q. stellata. Despite the root overlap, our relative water content and water potential indicate that J. virginiana was not water stressed in any of the plant combinations. Regardless, J. virginiana saplings had less total biomass in treatments with B. inermis and we recorded a significantly higher mortality when J. virginiana grew with both competitors. Root overlap and partitioning can affect how J. virginiana perform and adapt to new competitors and can allow their co-existence with grasses and other woody species, which can facilitate J. virginiana encroachment into grasslands and woodlands. Our data also show that competition with both Q. stellata and B. inermis could limit establishment, regardless of water availability.

AB The Australian 2019-2020 wildfires impacted the subtropical rainforest with a variety of burn severities, making them vulnerable to another burn. Rainforest post-fire regenerated vegetation could be highly flammable, containing fire-promoting species such as Lantana camara and fire-suppressing species such as Phytolacca octandra. This study investigated whether early post-fire regeneration may make rainforests more flammable and if this varies with fire severity. This study sampled three national parks where rainforest burnt in 2019-2020 across different fire severities to test if there were consistent patterns in post-fire regeneration flammability. We found that flammable species increased in the regions where fire severity was higher.

AB The ongoing global climate change is challenging all sectors, forestry notwithstanding. On the one hand, forest ecosystems are exposed to and threatened by climate change, but on the other hand, forests can influence the course of climate change by regulating the water regime, air quality, carbon sequestration, and even reduce climate extremes. Therefore, it is crucial to see climate change not only as a risk causing forest disturbances and economic consequences but also as an opportunity for innovative approaches to forest management, conservation, and silviculture based on the results of long-term research. We reviewed 365 studies evaluating the impact of climate change on European forest ecosystems, all published during the last 30 years (1993-2022). The most significant consequences of climate change include more frequent and destructive large-scale forest disturbances (wildfire, windstorm, drought, flood, bark beetle, root rot), and tree species migration. Species distribution shifts and changes in tree growth rate have substantial effects on ecosystem carbon storage. Diameter/volume increment changed from -1 to +99% in Central and Northern Europe, while it decreased from -12 to -49% in Southern Europe across tree species over the last ca. 50 years. However, it is important to sharply focus on the causes of climate change and subsequently, on adaptive strategies, which can successfully include the creation of species-diverse, spatially and age-wise structured stands (decrease drought stress and increase production), prolongation of the regenerative period, or the use of suitable introduced tree species (e.g., Douglas fir, black pine, and Mediterranean oaks). But the desired changes are based on increasing diversity and the mitigation of climate change, and will require significantly higher initial costs for silviculture practices. In conclusion, the scope and complexity of the topic require further comprehensive and long-term studies focusing on international cooperation. We see a critical gap in the transfer of research results into actual forest practice, which will be the key factor influencing afforestation of forest stands and forest growth in the following decades. What our forests will look like for future generations and what the resulting impact of climate change will be on forestry is in the hands of forest managers, depending on supportive forestry research and climate change policy, including adaptive and mitigation strategies.

AB Against a background of intensifying climate-induced disturbances, the need to enhance the resilience of forests and forest management is gaining urgency. In forest management, multiple trade-offs exist between different demands as well as across and within temporal and spatial scales. However, methods to assess resilience that consider these trade-offs are presently lacking. Here we propose a hierarchical framework of principles, criteria, and indicators to assess the resilience of a social-ecological system by focusing on the mechanisms behind resilience. This hierarchical framework balances trade-offs between mechanisms, different parts of the social-ecological system, ecosystem services, and spatial as well as temporal scales. The framework was developed to be used in a participatory manner in forest management planning. It accounts for the major parts of the forest-related social-ecological system and considers the multiple trade-offs involved. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a landscape dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Central Europe, managed for three different management goals. The framework highlights how forest resilience varies with the pursued management goals and related management strategies. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various forest management contexts as part of a participatory process with stakeholders. It thus is an important step towards operationalizing social-ecological resilience in forest management systems.

AB This study presents data on woody plant species richness and diversity of an inaccessible dry forest of Tula Mountains Woodland (TMW) located in the northeast of Nigeria. TMW supports a minimally disturbed mosaic of dry forest woodland. We sampled woody species in 190 plots of size 0.01-ha, spaced 50 m apart on series of line transects. We found a total of 133 woody species belonging to 88 genera and 39 families in 1.9 ha area sampled in total. Out of 133 species, 120 were identified to species level, and 113 were recorded as trees, shrubs and lianas with diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 5 cm. Species accumulation curve was non-asymptotic. Fisher's logseries model suggests that the plots sampled in the dry forest communities of TMW are represented by a high number of rare species. Of 120 identified species, 46 (38%) lacked evaluation on conservation status by IUCN. Out of 74 (62%) evaluated species, 2 were listed as critically endangered, 3 were vulnerable, and 69 were of least concern. In the TMW, 27% of woody species were restricted to Sudanian savannah biome, 61% occurred in Sudanian and Zambezian savannah biome. TMW serves as refugia for native plant species and plant communities in northeastern Nigeria.

ID CROCODYLUS-NILOTICUS; NILE; GROWTH
AB A description is provided of the crocodile remains that were found during an excavation carried out in 2019 at Qubbat al-Hawa (Aswan, Egypt). The material consists of five more or less complete bodies and five heads that were in varying states of preservation and completeness. The absence of resin, which was apparently not used during the preparation of the mummies, and the almost complete loss of linen bandages, due to insect damage, allowed a detailed morphological and osteometric description of the remains. Attention was focused on the general state of preservation of the crocodiles, the completeness of their skeletons and skulls, the presence of cut or other marks that could indicate the cause of death, and the processing of the carcasses. Moreover, the possible provenance of the crocodiles, the methods of capture and killing of the animals and their possible chronological attribution are discussed. It is concluded that the manner in which these specimens were prepared, as well as the variation observed in the type of 'final product', are unlike any other crocodile material described so far. The preparation method suggests a pre-Ptolemaic date for the deposit. The morphological and metrical features indicate that both Crocodylus niloticus and the recently resurrected species Crocodylus suchus are present among these individuals that range from 1.8 to 3.5 m in length.

AB Resilient city is an ideal goal and model of urban development proposed in response to today's complex and dynamic environmental changes. In this study, a resilient city evaluation framework of "social resilience-economic resilience-urban infrastructure and service-urban governance " was built upon the multi-dimensionality of the urban system; the entropy weight method was used to measure the level of urban resilience in Hunan Province while an obstacle degree model was used to identify any obstacle factor restricting to the development of resilience. The results show that the level of urban resilience in Hunan Province has grown slowly over the past 10 years, and there is an obvious regional difference in it. There are more and more highly resilient cities, but medium/low-resilience cities still dominate the province, forming a spatial process of evolution from "medium/high-level dispersion " to "medium/high-level aggregation " in the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan Urban Agglomeration. The level of urban resilience is predominantly hindered by the social and economic systems; at the index layer, most obstacle factors are moving from the economic system to the social-economic-urban infrastructure and service system.

AB Conspecific density is an important factor in determining the fecundity of pollinator-dependent plants. However, the outcome of increased conspecific density can range from reduced per capita pollination rates and fecundity (competition) to increased per capita pollination rates and fecundity (facilitation). I tested whether local conspecific density influenced pollination and fecundity in the rewarding orchid, Gymnadenia conopsea. I measured the distance to each of the nearest five plants in sixty patches of varying density in a large population in the Italian Apennine mountains. I examined whether pollen removal, pollen deposition, fruit, and seed set varied according to mean distance from conspecifics and plant height. After controlling for plant position in the population, the proportion of pollen removal, pollen deposition, and fruit set decreased with increasing distance from conspecifics, while pollen removal and deposition, but not fruit set, increased with increasing plant height. The proportion of viable seeds per fruit did not vary according to conspecific distance. Decreases in pollen removal, pollen deposition, and fruit set occurred within an average of 1 m distance from conspecific plants, indicating that local aggregation is an important determinant of both pollination success and fecundity. These results suggest that despite being a geographically widespread orchid, G. conopsea may suffer reduced fecundity when it occurs in small, isolated populations. Such field investigations can potentially lead to better predictions for successful re-establishment of populations of orchids under conservation-aided restoration efforts.

AB The rapid extinction of species is of considerable concern for biodiversity conservation. Identifying the drivers of species diversity and hotspots is beneficial for developing conservation strategies. Studies on insects have mainly focused on terrestrial species and rarely on semiaquatic species. Using 135,208 georeferenced occurrence records of 296 damselflies across North America, their species richness and endemism (represented by weighted endemism) patterns were mapped in a 100 x 100-km grid size, and the effects of environmental variables on species richness and endemism were investigated using generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning. Subsequently, the top 5% grids with species richness and weighted endemism were separately selected as hotspots and their congruence was evaluated. Finally, species diversity hotspots were identified by integrating two types of hotspot grids, and gap analysis was performed to evaluate their conservation status. Temperature conditions and water availability had the strongest influence on species richness and endemism, respectively. Low congruence among species richness and endemism hotspots was observed. Moreover, four species diversity hotspots were identified, namely, region of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada, southwestern United States, central Mexico, and southernmost North America. Approximately 69.31% of the hotspot grids are not a part of the existing protected areas, presenting a significant conservation gap. The habitats of taxonomic groups should be considered while identifying the most common driving mechanisms of endemism. Strengthening the establishment of protected areas in regions with conservation gaps is urgently needed to promote the conservation of damselflies in North America.

AB Wildlife trade is a multibillion-dollar industry and concerns not only the exploitation of animals for their body parts but is also largely fueled by the demand for exotic pets. We document, in Japan, a recent phenomenon closely related to the pet trade and rapidly spreading in Asia: the display of exotic animals in a cafe/bar context. We surveyed 142 exotic animal cafes (EACs) by visiting their website and/or social media accounts. We recorded every available exotic animal species, their status based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Appendix according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We compared the CITES Appendix-listed species imported in Japan during 1975-2019 to the species present in EACs. Most EACs opened in major cities between 2015 and 2017 under the label "owl cafe. " We recorded 3793 individuals belonging to 419 different species in 137 EACs active in 2019. The most numerous exotic animals were birds (62% - owls 40%) but reptiles (21%), mammals (15%) and to a lesser extent, amphibians (2%) were also found. A total of 403 individuals belonged to 52 threatened species. The majority (60%) of the species identified were CITES-listed (Appendix I: 53 individuals, 9 species; Appendix II:2482 individuals, 235 species and Appendix III:16 individuals, 6 species). While most species present in EACs are mainly imported as "captive bred " in Japan, we found 30 species that were mainly imported as "wild-caught, " "ranched " or "farmed. " The increase of importations of owl species is concomitant with the openings of EACs, reflecting the demand for owls in Japan. We argue that these EACs promoted through social media: (1) might have consequences for biodiversity as they encourage the purchase of exotic animals and represent a pool of potentially invasive species with their pathogens; (2) present a risk of pathogen transmission due to frequent close interactions with consumers; and (3) raise serious concerns about animal welfare.

AB National key protected wild plants (NKPWPs) are species with important conservation value based on genetics, ecology, culture, and/or scientific research, which are also confronted with serious threats. However, their geographical distribution patterns and conservation status remain unclear. In this study, we compiled 1032 species of NKPWPs. We measured the diversity to identify hotspots of NKPWPs based on species richness, weighted range size rarity and a complementarity-based analysis. Comparing the distribution and hotspots of NKPWPs with the coverage of Chinese nature reserves (NRs), we assessed conservation effectiveness and identified conservation gaps. The results identified 13 diversity hotspots; only 9.5% of them were covered by NRs with >30% of the grid cell area, and even 19.5% were not covered at all by NRs. Overall, 44.7% of NKPWPs were effectively protected by national NRs. Despite this success, 571 species in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangxi, Guangdong, southern Hainan, Taiwan, and northern Xinjiang remain unprotected by NRs. The protected proportion of plants with first-level protection was lower than that of plants with second-level protection. The low overall proportion of protected hotspots indicates that the conservation outlook for NKPWPs is not optimistic. This study identifies priority conservation areas and conservation gaps and provides a scientific reference for the conservation of wild plants in China.

AB Research into freshwater fungi have generated a wealth of information over the past decades with various published articles, i.e., reviews, books, and monographs. With the advancement of methodologies used in freshwater fungal research, and numerous mycologists working on this ecological group, our knowledge progress and understanding of freshwater fungi, including novel discoveries and new insights in the ecology of freshwater fungi has advanced. The last published book tackling diverse aspects of freshwater fungi was published eight years ago and with the enormous progress, it is timely that an updated account of freshwater fungi be compiled in one volume. Thus, this account is published to give a comprehensive overview of the different facets of freshwater fungal biology. It includes an updated classification scheme based on the latest taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis of freshwater fungal taxa, including their evolutionary history. The biology, diversity, and geographical distribution of higher and basal freshwater fungi are also discussed in the entries. A section on dispersal and adaptation of filamentous freshwater fungi is included in the present work. The ecological importance and role of fungi in the breakdown of wood in freshwater habitats, including their physiology, are discussed in detail. The biotechnological potential of freshwater fungi as producers of bioactive metabolites are reviewed, with methodologies in antimicrobial drug discovery. The present volume also provides an overview of different high throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms for freshwater fungal research highlighting their advantages and challenges, including recent studies of HTS in identification and quantification of fungal communities in freshwater habitats. The present volume also identifies the knowledge gaps and direction of future research in freshwater fungi.

AB The trophic dynamics of islands with low terrestrial primary productivity often depend on marine allochthonous inputs from nearby donor habitats. For instance, on Malpelo Island, Colombia (4 & DEG; 00 & PRIME; 05.63 & DPRIME; N; 81 & DEG; 36 & PRIME; 36.41 & DPRIME; W), the Nazca booby Sula granti affects the productivity and trophic dynamics of the terrestrial ecosystem by delivering nutrients, primary in the form guano, chick carcasses, and eggs. This study evaluated the trophic connectivity between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems of Malpelo Island, Colombia based on the isotopic (delta C-13 and delta N-15) assessment of 403 samples (107 terrestrial and 296 marine) collected between 2017 and 2021. Isospaces were estimated based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, contribution of terrestrial sources in consumer diets (mixing model), (15) N enrichment in C-3 plants, and interactions among environments (overlap). delta C-13 and delta N-15 values showed a larger terrestrial isospace (134.7 parts per thousand (2)) than the marine isospace (117.2 parts per thousand (2)). The mixing model indicated that detritus(Terrestrial) (median: 30.2%) contributed more to the food web than C-3 plants (0.2%), reflecting high delta C-13(Marine) content. The high isotopic overlap (> 60%) between terrestrial and marine isospaces suggests a significant trophic connection between environments. These results show the role of the marine ecosystem on the terrestrial ecosystem and the importance of S. granti regarding nutrient transfer between environments. The conservation of this seabird is essential to maintain the balance of this insular ecosystem. Using stable isotopes, this study was able to reveal trophic relationships between ecosystems associated with small oceanic islands that host large seabird colonies but have low primary productivity.

AB Climate change and inappropriate management practices in semi-arid savannas often result in shrub encroachment. Chemical shrub control is a common rehabilitation measure to counter shrub encroachment. A recent development, particularly in southern Africa, is the conversion from cattle to wildlife farming. Cattle and wildlife exhibit different behaviours, and different management practices are used. How these differences affect the results of rehabilitation measures is not well known. Here, we compared how selective chemical shrub control in these two land uses affected herbaceous diversity, and composition along waterhole transects (proxy for grazing pressure). Shrub control increased Simpson diversity when both land uses were analysed together, while land use type did not affect any diversity measure. However, when land uses were analysed individually, spatial differences in diversity became apparent. Species richness in game farms was affected by shrub control only at distances greater than 300m from waterholes, and in cattle farms total abundance increased at 1000m distances. Eleven species contributed to compositional differences between land uses. Our results show that bush control can improve ecosystem functioning and habitat heterogeneity in both land use types, which is particu-larly important given the current transition from livestock to game farming in southern Africa.

AB This study provides a unique vista of tourism biosecurity preparedness for a destinations' tourist ports of entry. Existing tourism biosecurity research deals with organisational resilience and tourists' biosecurity behaviour, however, has not explicitly examined tourism biosecurity preparedness at global or destinations tourist ports of entry levels. To fill this gap, this research utilises twenty-six tourism biosecurity criteria generated from a systematic international literature review to analyse international biosecurity instruments and Irish tourist ports of entry. A mixed-method approach was utilised through content analysis of international biosecurity instruments and Irish tourist ports of entry. A survey and semi-structured interviews were used to support the findings of the content analysis at Irish tourist ports of entry. Analysis determined the Irish tourist ports of entry sampled were severely lacking any provision for tourism biosecurity preparedness. International biosecurity instruments had a necessary level of biosecurity standards; however, a notable omission of tourism that adversely impacts tourism biosecurity preparedness. This research recommends international biosecurity instruments improve capacities for tourism -specific measures. Tourist ports of entry should integrate specific tourism biosecurity measures into passenger operations to ensure greater destination resilience.

AB Most alien plant species are usually discovered in new areas either immediately or within a relatively short period of time after their introduction. However, the introduction, spread, and invasion of some species go unnoticed for a long time. In Lithuania, such an alien plant is Cornus sanguinea subsp. australis, whose cryptic invasion has gone unnoticed due to its similarity to the native subsp. sanguinea. Cornus sanguinea subsp. australis is native to southeastern Europe and western Asia and is considered alien in other parts of Europe. This study, which was carried out between 2018 and 2022 in the territory of Lithuania, aimed to identify the distribution of the subsp. australis, as well as assess certain reproductive traits and its impact on the species diversity of the invaded communities. The results showed that the cryptic invasion of subsp. australis in Lithuania has been going on for several decades and is now well advanced. We found that the alien subspecies grows faster and that individuals in analogous habitats mature earlier than the native subsp. sanguinea. Furthermore, subsp. australis, compared to subsp. sanguinea, produces more flowers per inflorescence (84.0 +/- 25.0 and 49.7 +/- 20.9, respectively) and sets and ripens more fruits (25.6 +/- 9.7 and 18.2 +/- 7.6, respectively), which are among the most important factors for its further fast spread and invasion. The results of the vegetation analysis showed that the increase in abundance of both subspecies has a negative effect on species diversity in the community. However, the effect of the native subspecies on plant species diversity was negligible, while the effect of the alien subspecies was moderately negative and significant (r = -0.47; p < 0.05). Based on the results of the study, we can conclude that the alien subsp. australis performs better than the native subsp. sanguinea. Considering the current distribution and the drivers of dispersal, we suppose that subsp. australis will continue to spread rapidly in Lithuania and may pose a threat to the native subsp. sanguinea populations.

AB The African endemic cycad genus Encephalartos consists of 68 extant taxa, that are of great conservation con-cern as 85% are threatened (CR, EN, or VU) and four, are extinct in the wild (EW). Due to there being no for-mally published monographs for the genus, there is lack of consensus on taxonomically significant characters. This lack of clarity regarding the species relationships and access to several taxa have made researching this group challenging. Nevertheless, numerous studies have proven that this genus has low levels of genetic variation over a wide distribution. The aim of this study was to produce the most robust phylogenetic reconstruction of Encephalartos to date. This was done by using markers from three different genomes -plastid (rbcL, matK-trnK, trnH-psbA, cab), mitochondrial (nad1) and nuclear (26S, AGAMOUS, NEEDLY, nrITS1) -for all currently accepted taxa. The results obtained show an increase in resolution for both the backbone and species level relationships compared to previous work. This genus can be separated into five new geographic groups -northern African, central African, eastern African, Mozambican -Zimbab-wean, and southern African. There is also an indication that the evolution of the southern African group is driven by a form of reproductive isolation. Further studies on this group should be approached systematically based on the foundation provided by the linages that are shown in this study.(c) 2022 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The updating and rethinking of vegetation classifications is important for ecosystem monitoring in a rapidly changing world, where the distribution of vegetation is changing. The general assumption that discrete and persistent plant communities exist that can be monitored efficiently, is rarely tested before undertaking a classification. Marion Island (MI) is comprised of species-poor vegetation undergoing rapid environmental change. It presents a unique opportunity to test the ability to discretely classify species-poor vegetation with recently developed objective classification techniques and relate it to previous classifications. We classified vascular species data of 476 plots sampled across MI, using Ward hierarchical clustering, divisive analysis clustering, non-hierarchical kmeans and partitioning around medoids. Internal cluster validation was performed using silhouette widths, Dunn index, connectivity of clusters and gap statistic. Indicator species analyses were also conducted on the best performing clustering methods. We evaluated the outputs against previously classified units. Ward clustering performed the best, with the highest average silhouette width and Dunn index, as well as the lowest connectivity. The number of clusters differed amongst the clustering methods, but most validation measures, including for Ward clustering, indicated that two and three clusters are the best fit for the data. However, all classification methods produced weakly separated, highly connected clusters with low compactness and low fidelity and specificity to clusters. There was no particularly robust and effective classification outcome that could group plots into previously suggested vegetation units based on species composition alone. The relatively recent age (c. 450,000 years B.P.), glaciation history (last glacial maximum 34,500 years B.P.) and isolation of the sub-Antarctic islands may have hindered the development of strong vascular plant species assemblages with discrete boundaries. Discrete classification at the community-level using species composition may not be suitable in such species-poor environments. Species-level, rather than community-level, monitoring may thus be more appropriate in species-poor environments, aligning with continuum theory rather than community theory.

And the prediction model of optimum population capacity is used to measure the balance between people and urban environment by Random Forest regression, so as to grasp the residential development of residence attraction areas with sufficient population capacity. From the whole residence attraction areas, future population development trends will not exceed the region's optimum population capacity, but there are problems in maintaining the population in the urban inducing areas, mainly reflected in the Suizenji-Kuhonji, Kengun and Nagamine regional hubs.

AB This study aimed to identify the main factors driving species richness and endemism patterns of Chinese wild Rhododendron as well as to assess the hotspots of species diversity and their con-servation status. We initially mapped the species richness and endemism (expressed by weighted endemism) patterns of 546 wild Rhododendron in China in 100 x 100 km grids using 13,969 occurrence records. Subsequently, the effects of environmental variables on species richness and endemism patterns were assessed using regression models, and hotspots were identified based on the areas overlapping in 10% of the grids with the highest species richness and endemism. Finally, the conservation status of the hotspots was evaluated via gap analysis. The key environmental variables affecting species richness and endemism patterns differed. Species richness patterns were significantly influenced by moisture index, whereas endemism patterns were significantly influenced by elevation range. Moreover, the following five species diversity hotspots were identified: southern Xizang, Hengduan Mountains, south-central Sichuan, eastern Yungui Plateau, and central Gansu; however, these hotspots are not fully covered by the existing nature reserves. Our results indicate that the establishment of nature reserves should be actively promoted to effectively protect wild Rhododendron in hotspots with a conservation gap.

AB Wildlife trade is a key driver of extinction risk, affecting at least 24% of terrestrial vertebrates. The persistent removal of species can have profound impacts on species extinction risk and selection within populations. We draw together the first review of characteristics known to drive species use - identifying species with larger body sizes, greater abundance, increased rarity or certain morphological traits valued by consumers as being particularly prevalent in trade. We then review the ecological implications of this trade-driven selection, revealing direct effects of trade on natural selection and populations for traded species, which includes selection against desirable traits. Additionally, there exists a positive feedback loop between rarity and trade and depleted populations tend to have easy human access points, which can result in species being harvested to extinction and has the potential to alter source-sink dynamics. Wider cascading ecosystem repercussions from trade-induced declines include altered seed dispersal networks, trophic cascades, long-term compositional changes in plant communities, altered forest carbon stocks, and the introduction of harmful invasive species. Because it occurs across multiple scales with diverse drivers, wildlife trade requires multi-faceted conservation actions to maintain biodiversity and ecological function, including regulatory and enforcement approaches, bottom-up and community-based interventions, captive breeding or wildlife farming, and conservation translocations and trophic rewilding. We highlight three emergent research themes at the intersection of trade and community ecology: (1) functional impacts of trade; (2) altered provisioning of ecosystem services; and (3) prevalence of trade-dispersed diseases. Outside of the primary objective that exploitation is sustainable for traded species, we must urgently incorporate consideration of the broader consequences for other species and ecosystem processes when quantifying sustainability.

AB This study assessed the effectiveness of no-take areas in the Table Mountain National Park MPA in protecting the biodiversity of intertidal rocky shores from impacts of harvesting. Surveys were conducted in areas of controlled harvesting and in no-take areas to compare the densities and sizes of exploited species and the community composition between shores experiencing these two levels of protection, in two ecoregions and on two types of rock substrate. Clear patterns emerged. Firstly, no-take areas had significantly greater densities of the exploited limpets Cymbula granatina, C. oculus and Scutellastra argenvillei, particularly on sandstone shores, relative to their abundance in harvested areas. Conversely, densities of the rarely harvested limpets S. cochlear, S. longicosta and S. granularis did not differ in any manner consistent with protection levels. Secondly, C. granatina and S. argenvillei were significantly larger in no-take areas, although C. oculus displayed the opposite pattern. None of the rarely harvested limpets showed consistent differences in sizes between protection levels. Thirdly, community composition differed between protection levels, particularly on sandstone shores and in the lower intertidal zones where limpets are common. No-take areas were distinguished by greater abundances of harvested limpets and mussels, while harvested areas were dominated by ephemeral and corticated algae, which flourished under reduced grazing pressure by limpets. Our study provides congruent evidence that no-take areas within this MPA are effective in maintaining a natural rocky-shore community composition, and natural densities and size structures of exploited species, testifying to the management success of no-take areas in the Table Mountain National Park, especially on sandstone shores of the Southern Benguela, where densities of harvested species are high, and harvesting is concentrated.

AB As a key component of terrestrial ecosystems, soil interacts directly with aboveground vegetation. Evaluating soil quality is therefore of great significance to comprehensively explore the interaction mechanism of this association. The purpose of this study was to fully understand the characteristics of aboveground vegetation, soil quality, and their potential coupling relationship among different forest types in Hunan Province, and to provide a theoretical basis for further exploring the mechanisms underlying soil-vegetation interactions in central China. We have set up sample plots of five kinds of forests (namely broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, coniferous broad-leaved mixed forest, bamboo forest, and shrub forest) in Hunan Province. To explore the differences of vegetation characteristics and soil physical and chemical properties among the five stand types, variance analysis, principal component analysis, and regression analysis were used. Finally, we explored the coupling relationship between soil quality and aboveground vegetation characteristics of each forest. We found that there were significant differences in soil quality among the forest types, ranked as follows: shrub forest > bamboo forest > broad-leaved forest > mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest > coniferous forest. In general, there was a negative correlation between vegetation richness and soil quality in the broad-leaved forest and the shrub forest, but they showed a positive correlation in the coniferous forest, the mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest, and the bamboo forest. As a necessary habitat condition for aboveground vegetation, soil directly determines the survival and prosperity of plant species. These results indicated that for vegetation-soil dynamics in a strong competitive environment, as one aspect wanes the other waxes. However, in a weak competitive environment, the adverse relationship between vegetation and soil is less pronounced and their aspects can promote.

AB Despite their diversity, global distribution, and apparent effects on host biology, the rules of life that govern variation in microbiomes among host species remain unclear, particularly in freshwater organisms. In this study, we sought to assess whether geographic location, taxonomy (order, family, and genus), or functional feeding group (FFG) designations would best explain differences in the gut microbiome composition among macroinvertebrates sampled across 10 National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) freshwater stream sites in the United States. Subsequently, we compared the beta diversity of microbiomes among locations, taxonomy (order, family, and genus), and FFGs in a single statistical model to account for variation within the source microbial community and the types of macroinvertebrates sampled across locations. We determined significant differences in community composition among macroinvertebrate orders, families, genera, and FFGs. Differences in microbiome compositions were underscored by different bacterial ASVs that were differentially abundant among variables (four bacterial ASVs across the 10 NEON sites, 43 ASVs among the macroinvertebrate orders, and 18 bacterial ASVs differing among the five FFGs). Analyses of variations in microbiome composition using the Bray-Curtis distance matric revealed FFGs as the dominant source of variation (mean standard deviation of 0.8), followed by stream site (mean standard deviation of 0.5), and finally family and genus (mean standard deviation of 0.3 each). Our findings revealed a principal role for FFG classification in insect gut microbiome beta diversity with additional roles for geographic distribution and taxonomy.

AB Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) populations that exist outside of protected areas are under threat in South Africa. They are believed to predominantly feed on fish, but they also take prey from the terrestrial system, which brings them into conflict with humans and hampers their management. Here, we use stable light isotope analysis to explore the diet of an unprotected Nile Crocodile population in the Olifants River, Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces. Nitrogen stable isotope ratios were obtained from fish and crocodile populations along the length (+/- 430 km) of the river. The catchment is severely polluted with elevated delta N-15 values at nutrient hotspots, which provides a basis for tracking the trophic response of crocodiles to the longitudinal profile of fish delta N-15 values. Crocodiles did not respond to changes in the delta N-15 values of fish populations and dietary predictions based on size-specific diet to tissue discrimination factors suggests a nonaquatic food base. These results suggest terrestrial diet dependence in one of the few viable Nile Crocodile populations from outside protected areas, posing unique challenges to their conservation.

AB Burrow builders are often classified as ecosystem engineers because their digging activities regulate the availability of resources for other organisms. As antlion larvae prefer to construct their traps in bare sandy or loose soil, they could benefit from burrowing activities. We investigated the role of burrow builders as ecosystem engineers for antlions (Myrmeleontidae) in a tropical semideciduous forest in Mexico. The number of traps of antlion larvae was recorded on 30 sampling quadrats (45 cm) at the entrance of burrows (of unidentified builders) and on 30 paired off-burrow quadrats. Additionally, the percentage of bare soil was estimated for the 60 quadrats sampled. Of the 30 quadrats at the entrance of burrows, a total of 336 traps were recorded, with 21 (70%) of them having at least one trap, while for the 30 off-burrows quadrats, only two (6.6%) of them had traps, just three in total. The percentage of bare soil and the abundance of traps were significantly greater in quadrats at the entrance of burrows compared to quadrats without burrows. The abundance of traps at the entrance of burrows was positively affected by the percentage of bare soil. The few traps in the off-burrows quadrats suggested that, in addition to the limited bare soil, ground compactness probably limits the establishment of antlion larvae. Otherwise, when digging, burrow builders create small patches of bare sandy soils that are used by these insects. We concluded that the ecosystem engineering effect of burrow builders is an important structuring element for antlion populations in the tropical semideciduous forest studied.

AB Simple Summary Human life depends on the provision of ecosystem services from grasslands ecosystem, which have been threatened due to practices adopted by current farming systems. Researchers have thus pointed out the use of systems thinking and design theory to create more sustainable pastoral live-stock production systems that work within grasslands for the continuous delivery of multiple ecosystem services. Systems thinking is a holistic theory that brings different perspectives from a particular situation and design theory is a prescriptive theory that aims to achieve a defined goal by using specific tools and background. In this narrative review, we explain why the use of both theories would contribute to the creation of more sustainable livestock production systems and provide an overview of grasslands with the goal of creating the required design framework for the design of pastoral livestock production systems that enhance grassland health. Grasslands and ecosystem services are under threat due to common practices adopted by modern livestock farming systems. Design theory has been an alternative to promote changes and develop more sustainable strategies that allow pastoral livestock production systems to evolve continually within grasslands by enhancing their health and enabling the continuous delivery of multiple ecosystem services. To create a design framework to design alternative and more sustainable pastoral livestock production systems, a better comprehension of grassland complexity and dynamism for a diagnostic assessment of its health is needed, from which the systems thinking theory could be an important approach. By using systems thinking theory, the key components of grasslands-soil, plant, ruminant-can be reviewed and better understood from a holistic perspective. The description of soil, plant and ruminant individually is already complex itself, so understanding these components, their interactions, their response to grazing management and herbivory and how they contribute to grassland health under different climatic and topographic conditions is paramount to designing more sustainable pastoral livestock production systems. Therefore, by taking a systems thinking approach, we aim to review the literature to better understand the role of soil, plant, and ruminant on grassland health to build a design framework to diagnose and enhance grassland health under pastoral livestock production systems.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the growth pattern of farmed Crocodylus moreletii individuals from hatchling to juvenile. A total of 3,743 crocodiles (3,098 males and 645 females) were included. Crocodiles hatched from artificially incubated eggs. Individuals were classified into three age categories: (1) neonate (0-4 months), (2) developing (4-12 months), and (3) juvenile (12-27 months). Seven biometric evaluations were conducted. The first one was at 4 d after hatching, and the following evaluations were at 4, 8, 12, 17, 22, and 27 months of age. In each evaluation, the total length, weight, and sex of each individual were registered. Crocodiles were subsequently classified into three growth groups: (1) fast: length and weight greater than 1 SD from the mean, (2) average: length and weight within 1 SD from the mean, and (3) slow: length and weight lower than 1 SD from the mean. Linear polynomial (LPN), quadratic polynomial (QPN), and three-parameter sigmoidal (SIG3) models were used to evaluate length and weight as a function of age to describe growth. For length and weight, SIG3 and QPN, respectively, produced the highest R-2 in all growth groups and the general population. LPN did not fit the weight data. The models that best fitted length and weight in relation to age were SIG3 and QPN, so both could be used to evaluate the growth pattern in other populations of farmed young Crocodylus moreletii.

AB The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic regions in China. Changes in land comprehensive carrying capacity (LCCC) is of vital significance. In China, various studies have assessed LCCC, however, they majorly focused on single cities, with less studies focusing on urban agglomeration, particularly GBA. Based on social, economic, resource and technology aspects, we established an index system for evaluating LCCC by the entropy method. It analyses temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of LCCC from 11 cities in the GBA of China, 2009-2018. There are many social, economic, resource and technology differences among the 4 subsystems. We established that technology is the prominent factor in LCCC. With regards to LCCC, these cities have their respective strengths and weaknesses. On a temporal basis, there were rising trends in LCCC curves, with different degrees of the 11 cities. Spatially, LCCC is relatively high in central cities and it exhibits a declining pattern of the carrying capacity from the city center outwards. Therefore, regional collaborative efforts are vital for increasing LCCC.

AB The loess hilly and gully region is an ecologically fragile area with poor ecological restoration and service capacity. Enhancing regional spatial resilience is conducive to upgrading carrying capacity and service capability of local ecosystems. Focusing on the Sanshuihe River Basin, this study intends to explore watershed ecosystem based on complex network theory and constructs a research framework of "space simulation - resilience assessment - spatial optimization". The results show that the Basin forms a network structure based on lakes, wetlands, scenic spots and parks, with 36 ecological nodes and 60 ecological corridors in total. In the future, there will be 16 additional ecological nodes and 38 ecological corridors in the Basin, thus further stabilizing its ecosystem and enhancing connectivity and recreational attributes. Besides, the independence, collaboration, connectivity, interdependence, stability and functionality of ecological nodes grow by 14.9%, 10.4%, 10.0%, 51.4%, 5.77% and 33.20%, respectively. In the end, the study defines the boundary for water conservation, recreational area and forest conservation area in the watershed, divides functional ecological corridors into four types, classifies the importance of the development (protection) of ecological sources, and comes up with corresponding schemes for spatial optimization. The research findings can not only offer guidance for the assessment and optimization of spatial resilience of small watershed, but also lay a basis for regional ecological restoration, resource exploitation and ecological network planning.

AB Wildlife count data are used to provide estimates of population abundance. To quantify changes in the size of populations, it is necessary to determine the precision of abundance estimates. Ground or aerial survey methods are often intended to be a census and thus do not provide estimates of precision. One solution is to switch approaches to a different sampling and estimation procedure, such as distance sampling. Using an example of the long-term waterfowl censuses in the Camargue, a major wintering area in southern France, we used simulation to quantify the precision and cost effectiveness of transitioning to a distance sampling approach. Based on abundance and distribution data for 14 species of waterbirds (Anatidae and coot [Fulica atra]) in the Camargue, we evaluated 5 distance sampling scenarios with parallel line transects corresponding to 5 different sampling intensities. Our results suggested that, if the objective of counts is to estimate the abundance of all waterfowl together, switching from pseudo-total to distance sampling counts would be realistic on both statistical and financial grounds. The most advantageous scenario would correspond to a sampling effort with transect lines spaced 1,000 m apart, which would allow a coefficient of variation of 0.20 for total waterfowl abundance with a 27% increase in flight costs compared to the current method. Heterogeneity in the size of detected bird groups contributed to the variability in our results, however, adjusting sampling effort from 1,750 m spaced transect to 760 m allowed reduced variation by 55%. We recommend proceeding to test flights which would allow some site-specific parameters to be refined before changing methods. However, the distance sampling method as simulated here would prove impractical to evaluate the abundance and distribution of one species alone.

AB Context Growth releases of individuals that survive disturbances are important compensatory response mechanisms that contribute to ecological resilience. However, the role of fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in shaping compensatory growth responses is poorly understood for many broad-scale disturbances.
   Objectives We quantified how fine-scale spatial structure affects individual and aggregate tree growth leading up to and following a severe mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak. We asked: (1) How does individual tree growth vary with tree- and neighborhood-scale characteristics? (2) How do within-stand aggregate growth and overstory recruitment vary with neighborhood-scale characteristics?
   Methods We used a spatially explicit long-term monitoring dataset of a subalpine lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest (in Colorado, USA) in which every tree >= 5 cm diameter was measured and mapped prior to (1989, 2004) and following (2018) a severe MPB outbreak (2003-2011). We used spatial regression to characterize drivers of growth.
   Results Overall, we found strong evidence for post-outbreak compensatory responses across spatial scales. Neighborhood characteristics shaped both individual and aggregate growth, with the magnitude of growth strongly mediated by pre-outbreak neighborhood structure and neighborhood mortality. Variation in tree-scale growth, combined with the spatial arrangement of surviving trees, resulted in highly variable emergent patterns of aggregate growth and recruitment.
   Conclusion Our findings highlight the importance of fine-scale landscape configuration in shaping forest resilience. Quantifying compensatory responses in a spatially explicit framework at different scales is critical for modeling post-disturbance forest dynamics, which is increasingly important as climate warms and forest disturbance regimes change.

AB Vibrio and Ostreid herpesvirus 1 are responsible for mass mortalities of oyster larvae in hatcheries. Relevant works have focused on their relationships with the disease when larval mortality occurs. On the contrary, little is known about how the resident microbiota in oyster larvae responds to Vibrio-infected disease causing mortality as the disease progressed, whereas this knowledge is fundamental to unveil the etiology of the disease. Here, we analyzed the temporal succession of the microbiome of Kumamoto oyster (Crassostrea sikamea) larvae during their early development, accompanied by a Vibrio-caused mortality event that occurred at the post D-stage of larval development in a shellfish hatchery in Ningbo, China, on June 2020. The main causative agent of larval mortality was attributable to Vibrio infection, which was confirmed by linearly increased Vibrio abundance over disease progression. Larval bacterial communities dramatically changed over host development and disease progression, as highlighted by reduced alpha-diversity and less diverse core taxa when the disease occurred. Null model and phylogenetic-based mean nearest taxon distance analyses showed that the relative importance of deterministic processes governing larval bacterial assembly initially increased over host development, whereas this dominance was depleted over disease progression. Furthermore, we screened the disease-discriminatory taxa with a significant change in their relative abundances, which could be indicative of disease progression. In addition, network analysis revealed that disease occurrence remodeled the co-occurrence patterns and niche characteristics of larval microbiota. Our findings demonstrate that the dysbiosis of resident bacterial communities and the shift of microecological mechanisms in the larval microbiome may contribute to mortality during oyster early development.

AB The destruction of natural habitats is among the major factors responsible for the decrease in species diversity and distribution. This study focused on the effect of vegetation and its interaction with the season on ant species richness, density, activity, and composition in the three dominant habitats - forest, fallow, and mixed crop field - prevailing in southern Cameroon. Ants were sampled using two sampling techniques -pitfall trap and quadrat - in fallows, forest, and mixed crop fields from May 2007 to April 2008. Average ant species richness did not differ between fallow and forest, but the number of species in both habitats was higher compared with mixed-crop field. Species richness was also higher during the short dry season compared with other seasons. Species density was higher in mixed-crop field and in the long dry season. Species activity was similar in the three habitats, but it was higher during the long-wet season. Species richness, activity, and density were lower at low altitude. Vegetation and season affected the composition of ant species, but not the interaction between the two factors. The highest dissimilarity index was observed between mixed crop-field and forest while between seasons, it was between the short-wet and the long dry season. These results suggest that vegetation cover and abiotic factors interact to determine the distribution, density, activity, and composition of ant species. Identifying key drivers among environmental factors could help to understand the response of species to the variation of those factors in the context of climate change.

AB Context. Aerial surveys are widely used for estimating the abundance of wildlife over large areas. The failure to count all animals within survey transects is commonly acknowledged and there are many techniques to measure and correct for underestimation. However, the possibility of animals being counted more than once in intensive surveys, which leads to overestimation, is rarely examined. Animals can move in response to observers or vehicles, and bias can occur when animals move before or after detection. Movement of animals immediately prior to and associated with observation processes is methodologically accommodated in distance sampling but bias attributable to responsive movement after observation platforms have passed requires investigation. Aims. We sought to investigate potential biases caused by animal movement during intensive helicopter surveys of feral goats, and to quantify the probability that animals are available for recounting because of their responsive movements. Methods. Using ground-based behavioural studies simultaneous with intensive helicopter strip surveys of feral goats, we measured the extent of responsive movement, distances and directions moved, and sampling design parameters, and contrasted those with random movements. Key results. Feral goats did not move randomly in response to helicopters. Animals within the transect strips, and therefore potentially visible from the aircraft, were more likely to move than those outside the transect. Considerable responsive movement (flushing) occurred between transects and more animals (64%, n = 448) moved towards unsampled transects than towards transects already sampled. Because of the spatial separation of transects, 21% of goats were available for recounting in adjacent transects, leading to potential overestimation. Conclusions. Although most extensive surveys of macropods and other wildlife in Australia account for overestimation in their design, surveys that sample intensively and apply valid corrections for undercounting are likely to produce positively biased estimates of abundance where flushing occurs. Likewise, intensive thermal surveys could be subject to positive bias for animals prone to flushing. This is routinely ignored in wildlife management and research where close transects are used to estimate abundance. Implications. Responsive movement requires consideration when designing intensive aerial surveys of wildlife. Randomised transects without replacement or larger distances between transects will counteract recounting bias.

AB The distribution of larval fishes is influenced by where they hatch and their movements after hatching. In the San Francisco Estuary, the threatened longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys spawns adhesive eggs in fresh to brackish water. Attached eggs hatch and the larvae disperse seaward toward higher-salinity water. Actual locations of spawning and hatching are unknown, and cannot reliably be inferred from distributions of larvae because intense tidal mixing obscures the history of movement. Human interventions such as manipulations and diversions of freshwater flow may contribute to the ongoing decline of this species, and these effects depend on where the fish hatch. We combined movement estimated using hydrodynamic and particle-tracking modeling with trawl data using a Bayesian model to estimate the location and timing of hatching, as well as natural mortality of larvae and losses to freshwater diversions. Results indicate that longfin smelt may hatch further seaward than previously believed, and that estimated direct losses due to diversions were small relative to other sources of mortality. Abundance of this species varies similar to 100-fold with freshwater flow, but our results suggest that proportional entrainment was practically zero during an extreme wet year and relatively low (2 %) in a moderately dry year. This method could be applied to other estuarine and coastal systems where strong mixing reduces the ability of simpler models to predict hatching locations and larval movements.

AB There are renewed global efforts to make wildlife conservation the foundation for broad-based economic development. This article looks at these tendencies in the 'Kruger to Canyons' (K2C) biosphere region in South Africa, encompassing the Kruger National Park and adjacent settlement areas and reserves. Various forms of the wildlife economy have a long history in this region. However, it is increasingly posited as a preternatural means for creating jobs. We chronicle the growth of the wildlife economy from its apartheid heyday to the present, showing its fundamental dependence on the ecological and political fragmentation of space. More generally, these biopolitical divisions are part of a broad contestation of wildlife value, organised around changing regimes of protected area enclosure and the spacing of human and non-human life. Despite recent claims by the South African conservation industry that it is demolishing fences and increasing habitat connectivity, political territorialisation and ecological fragmentation continue to be important means of securing profit and reducing perceived risk. While the contradictions of this dynamic have now become acute through the emergence of the rhino-poaching crisis, the growth of that violent industry, we conclude, should not be seen as the negative inversion of a legal wildlife economy. Instead, both the legal and the illegal wildlife economies are manifestations of the same underlying problems: ill-conceived attempts at agrarian reform; the persistent influence of an older veterinary wildlife assemblage; the continued role of the rural poor as an enabling but unacknowledged buffer between development and wildlife.

DT Article
ID EXTINCTION RISK; CONSERVATION; BEHAVIOR; BIRDS
AB The species endangerment listing process is governed not solely by causal factors but also by human perception, particularly as it relates to observability. Because human perception is important in species detection, we hypothesized that ecological indicators associated with human perception would change noticeably over time. Testing our hypothesis on species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, we found that - in general and across (not within) different taxa - body mass and geographic range of listed species decreased over time and that animals that produced vocalizations and exhibited grouping behavior were listed earlier than silent and solitary animals. Specifically, since the year of their listing, the body mass of birds, mammals, and reptiles decreased, whereas the body mass of amphibians increased; likewise, the geographic range of insects, mammals, and plants contracted, whereas the geographic range of amphibians, bivalves, birds, and fish slightly expanded. Our results demonstrate a temporal shift in endangered species listings, suggesting that approaches to listing species may need to be reevaluated and methodologically revised.

AB Background: The subtropical dune thicket (hereafter "dune thicket") of the Cape Floristic Region experiences a wide range of fire exposure throughout the landscape, unlike other dry rainforest formations that rarely experience fire. We sought to determine how fire exposure influences species composition and the architectural composition of dune thicket.
   Methods: We used multivariate analysis and diversity indices based on cover abundance of species to describe the species composition, architectural guild composition and structure of dune thicket sites subject to different levels of fire exposure, namely low (fire return interval of >100 years), moderate (fire return interval of 50-100 years), and high (fire return interval of 10-50 years).
   Results: The diversity, cover abundance and architectural guild cover abundance of dune thicket canopy species were strongly influenced by the level of fire exposure such that each level was associated with a well-circumscribed vegetation unit. Dune thickets subject to low fire exposure comprises a floristically distinct, low forest characterized by shrubs with one-to-few upright stems (ca. 4-8 m tall) and a relatively small canopy spread (vertical growers). Of the 25 species in this unit, 40% were restricted to it. Dune thickets subject to moderate fire exposure had the highest abundance of lateral spreaders, which are multi-stemmed (ca. 3-6 m tall) species with a large canopy spread and lower stature than vertical growers. None of the 17 species found in this unit was restricted to it. Dune thickets subject to high fire exposure had the highest abundance of hedge-forming shrubs, these being low shrubs (ca. 0.6-1.4 m tall), with numerous shoots arising from an extensive system of below-ground stems. Of the 20 species in this unit, 40% were restricted to it. Multivariate analysis identified three floristic units corresponding to the three fire exposure regimes. Compositional structure, in terms of species and architectural guilds, was most distinctive for dune thickets subject to high and low fire exposure, while the dune thicket subject to moderate fire exposure showed greatest compositional overlap with the other units.
   Conclusion: Fire exposure profoundly influenced the composition and structure of dune thicket canopy species in the Cape Floristic Region. In the prolonged absence of fire, the thicket is invaded by vertical-growing species that overtop and outcompete the multi-stemmed, laterally-spreading shrubs that dominate this community. Regular exposure to fire selects for traits that enable thicket species to rapidly compete for canopy cover post-fire via the prolific production of resprouts from basal buds below- and above-ground. The trade-off is that plant height is constrained, as proportionately more resources are allocated to below-ground biomass.

AB In small-scale fisheries that suffer from weak formal governance, fishers use a variety of institutional strategies to self-govern. These self-governance arrangements may or may not be forms of collective action, yet they rely on informal institutions (such as norms of reciprocity) in generating social cohesion among users so that common rules can be agreed upon. Social network perspectives have been used to understand the cohesiveness of fishers operating with different gear types or in different communities, yet less is known about how social cohesion differs between fishers that operate through formal cooperative arrangements, such as fishing associations, and independent fishers who operate solely at the community level through informal cooperation. Using mixed methods, we compared the social cohesion of commercial fishers arising from information-sharing and work-support networks in four fishing communities of north-eastern Puerto Rico, as they coped with prolonged hurricane recovery and the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) were applied to untangle the drivers of cohesion emerging from fisher's information-sharing patterns. Fisher's communication was driven not just by operating at the same landing site or using the same primary gear type, but also by choosing to organize their fishing under the same self-governance arrangement. Specifically, fishers that were members of fishing associations mostly communicated among themselves, while independent fishers talked across arrangements, indicating the role of fishing associations in fostering social cohesion. However, associated fishers were less likely to receive information than independent fishers, suggesting the need for targeted communication strategies within each group. Moreover, independent fishers had more work support ties and a greater diversity of supporting actors across the supply chain, suggesting their need for higher levels of linking social capital. Multiple social factors explained whether fishers choose to be members of fishing associations or remain independent, including trust in leaders and agreement on membership rules. These findings highlight the importance of knowing the cohesiveness of cooperation networks among small-scale fishers.

AB The prehensile-tailed skink Corucia zebrata is endemic to the Solomon Islands. It is the most traded reptile from the country. During 2000-2019, CITES reported the legal export of 10,567 individuals. Although the level of this trade is well documented, impacts on the skink's survival in its native range are comparatively unknown. During January-May 2020, we surveyed 146 people on 12 islands to collect information on the habitats preferred by the prehensile-tailed skink, to understand perceptions of the species' conservation status and identify any potential threats. Respondents reported lowland and hill forests as being favoured habitats, with low proportions of respondents identifying coastal and montane forests as suitable habitat. Habitat loss (72%), hunting (17%), and predation (6%) were identified as the main threats. People younger than 30 years of age reported killing the skinks more frequently than did people over the age of 30. Prehensile-tailed skinks have a relatively small home range, long reproductive cycle, and are vulnerable to numerous threats. We thus recommend a halt to the current practice of exporting wild-caught prehensile-tailed skinks, and replacement by a well-regulated captive breeding programme.

AB Local populations of marine benthic macro-invertebrates with planktonic larvae are believed to be in source-sink relationships via larval dispersal in a regional population complex. Practically, such a region is definable only after connectivity of constituent local populations is explored. Numerical simulations abound for hydrodynamic connectivity by larvae between local/regional populations. Empirical studies have scarcely integrated inter-local connectivity and intra-local population dynamics into demographic connectivity analysis. I review the current research and indicate fundamental and technical problems to demonstrate that some source-sink systems in intertidal shores, which are most accessible among benthic habitats, are a good model. The challenge in benthic source-sink research comes from that existent local populations may not be self-sustaining because of low larval self-seeding rates and/or low benthos' survival rates and yet can persist as latent sinks. They may receive larvae leaking from sources at good-quality habitat patches with stationary larval retention areas for self-recruitment. On an intertidal sandflat in an estuary-coastal ocean region, Kyushu, Japan during 1979-2019, the population of a trochid gastropod with 3- to 9-day larval duration became extinct and recovered. The extinction was caused by sediment destabilization by a callianassid shrimp population which increased in the early 1980s. The gastropod recovery was owing to the shrimp decline by stingray predation and the transport of larvae from some self-sustainable populations with lower shrimp densities 30 km away. It was estimated that the gastropod population before the shrimp proliferation on that sandflat might be a latent sink requiring allochthonous larval subsidy due to epi-benthic predation on juveniles.

AB Temnospondyli are a morphologically varied and ecologically diverse clade of tetrapods that survived for over 200 million years. The body mass of temnospondyls is a key variable in inferring their ecological, physiological and biomechanical attributes. However, estimating the body mass of these extinct creatures has proven difficult because the group has no extant descendants. Here we apply a wide range of body mass estimation techniques developed for tetrapods to the iconic temnospondyls Paracyclotosaurus davidi and Eryops megacephalus. These same methods are also applied to a collection of extant organisms that serve as ecological and morphological analogues. These include the giant salamanders Andrias japonicus and Andrias davidianus, the tiger salamander Ambystoma tigrinum, the California newt Taricha torosa and the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus. We find that several methods can provide accurate mass estimations across this range of living taxa, suggesting their suitability for estimating the body masses of temnospondyls. Based on this, we estimate the mass of Paracyclotosaurus to have been between 159 and 365 kg, and that of Eryops between 102 and 222 kg. These findings provide a basis for examining body size evolution in this clade across their entire temporal span.

AB Identifying species' extinction risks and understanding their ecological associations are considered critical steps for achieving long-term conservation of biodiversity in the face of global changes. We evaluated the potential impact of global climate change (GCC) on the co-distribution patterns of 12 Mexican endemic hummingbirds and 118 plants they used as nectar resources. Using ecological niche modeling, we estimated the species' potential distribution areas and their degree of range overlap at present and under future scenarios (2040's-2080's). We then performed temporal beta diversity analyses (based on Sorensen's index) to assess changes in community assembly over time. To determine the potential impacts of GCC on the organization of hummingbird-plant relationships, we calculated niche overlap and network size metrics. Our results showed that even if we assume that species can disperse to novel habitat areas, at least 46.2% of hummingbirds and 45.8% of plant species will face range reductions due to changes in their climate-suitability areas, which will in turn result in an increased mismatch of their co-distribution patterns. Additionally, temporal beta analyses suggested species turnover between the present and future, as well as changes in niche size and overlap for hummingbird-plant co-occurrence networks. These changes could lead to the formation of novel assemblages through species reshuffling, with a tendency to the specialization of networks. These results emphasize that we should not expect uniform or matched responses among species and regions into the future. Therefore, analyses of species' co-occurrence are needed to accomplish the long-term protection of important ecosystem services such as pollination.

AB Theropods were the dominating apex predators in most Jurassic and Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Their feeding ecology has always been of great interest, and new computational methods have yielded more detailed reconstructions of differences in theropod feeding behaviour. Many approaches, however, rely on well-preserved skulls. Dental microwear texture (DMT) analysis is potentially applicable to isolated teeth, and here employed for the first time to investigate dietary ecology of theropods. In particular, we test whether tyrannosaurids show DMT associated with more hard-object feeding than compared to Allosaurus; this would be a sign for higher levels of osteophagy, as has often been suggested. We find no significant difference in complexity and roughness of enamel surfaces between Allosaurus and tyrannosaurids, which conflicts with inferences of more frequent osteophagic behaviour in Tyrannosaurus as compared to other theropods. Orientation of wear features reveals a more pronounced bi-directional puncture-and-pull feeding mode in Allosaurus than in tyrannosaurids. Our results further indicate ontogenetic niche shift in theropods and crocodylians, based on significantly larger height parameters in juvenile theropods which might indicate frequent scavenging, resulting in more bone-tooth contact during feeding. Overall, DMT is found to be very similar between theropods and extant large, broad-snouted crocodylians and shows great similarity in feeding ecology of theropod apex predators throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous.

AB A new species Leioproctus zephyr (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) is described from both sexes. Leioproctus zephyr sp. nov. is remarkable in featuring a large longitudinal ridge on the clypeus. This diagnostic morphological feature present in both sexes, along with various other distinctive characters including the male genitalia, female hind-tibial spur, and glossa morphology, clearly distinguish this species from all other Leioproctus. Along with these unique traits, L. zephyr cannot be classified into any of the existing subgenera of Leioproctus, sharing some, but not all, of the characters of the subgenera Ceratocolletes, Charicolletes, Protomorpha and Odontocolletes. DNA barcoding with the CO1 gene confirmed the sexes belonged to the same species and it did not match any previously barcoded species. This species is restricted to native vegetation remnants in the southwest Western Australian biodiversity hotspot, and is highly specialised, foraging only on a few species in the genus Jacksonia (Fabaceae). The unusual clypeus may be an adaptation for foraging on the keeled papilionaceous flowers. The limited number of sites this species has been collected from and its oligolectic diet suggest L. zephyr should be considered to be a species of conservation concern. Further taxonomic research is required to determine the phylogenetic position of this unusual Leioproctus.

AB Positive interactions have been hypothesised to influence plant community dynamics and species invasions. However, their prevalence and importance relative to negative interactions remain unclear to understand community change and invasibility. We examined pairwise biotic interactions using over 50 years of successional data to assess the prevalence of positive interactions and their effects on each focal species (either native or exotic). We found that positive interactions were widespread and the relative frequency of positive and negative interactions varied with establishment stage and between native and exotic species. Specifically, positive interactions were more frequent during early establishment and less frequent at later stages. Positive interactions involving native species were more frequent and stronger than those between exotic species, reducing the importance of invasional meltdown on succession. Our study highlights the role of positive native interactions in shielding communities from biological invasion and enhancing the potential for long-term resilience.

ID CHALLENGES
AB A common limitation for the effective management of widespread non-native species is translating and implementing the latest scientific knowledge for practitioners. Non-native tree invasions are no exception to this problem. We illustrate how the National Wilding Conifer Control Programme in New Zealand has worked to overcome these limitations through a partnership approach, ensuring affected communities are connected to on-the-ground responses, and facilitating the transfer of new scientific knowledge to practitioners. By ensuring the overarching management strategy was developed collaboratively with clear, mutually-agreed goals, the programme has helped to unite diverse stakeholders with a common purpose. Although coordinated by a central government body, the governance structure is sufficiently flexible to address the specific management needs of each affected community. The programme takes an adaptive management approach that enables multiple lines of research and management to be developed together; this is essential to improve management across different regions and stages of invasion. A co-developed strategy, partnership structure, and adaptive management were each critical components of the National Wilding Conifer Control Programme. However, there are ongoing challenges to overcome, such as securing long-term funding and reducing risks of re-invasion, to meet the ultimate goal of containing conifer invasions nationally. We suggest that lessons from this programme provide general insights into how linking people, government, and science could be used to improve the effectiveness of large-scale invasive non-native species management elsewhere.

AB Dental wear analyses are classically applied to mammals because they have evolved heterodont dentitions for sophisticated mastication. Recently, several studies have shown a correlation between pre-assigned and analytically inferred diet preferences in extant reptiles through dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA), a method using quantitative assessment of microscopic wear marks to reconstruct the diet material properties. The first tentative applications of DMTA to extinct reptiles have followed. However, for large and small mammals, microwear analyses have undergone a long time of ground-truthing through direct feeding observations, stomach content analyses, and feeding experiments. Such data are currently lacking for reptiles, but are necessary to further extend DMTA, especially to Archosauria, as the application to dinosaurs could be of great interest to the scientific community. We herein present data from a pilot feeding experiment with five juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). Each individual received a diet of assumed different hardness for similar to 4 months: crocodylian pellets (control), sardines, quails, rats, or crawfish. All individuals initially received the same pellet diet, and we found them to show similar dental microwear texture patterns before they were switched to their designated experimental diet. From the first feeding bout on, dental microwear textures differed across the diets. The crawfish-feeder showed consistently higher surface complexity, followed by the rat-feeder. Quail- and fish-feeding resulted in similar wear signatures, with low complexity. Fast tooth replacement and selective tooth use likely affected microwear formation, but we were able to detect a general hard (crawfish and rat) versus soft (quail and fish) DMTA signature. Such patterns can support the identification of hard-object feeding in the fossil record.

AB Consumers, including megaherbivores and fire, are considered important limiting forces for woody plants and canopy closure in African savannas. However, climatic events like drought can also play a significant role in limiting trees and maintaining tree-grass coexistence in savannas. The extent to which top-down control (e.g. megaherbivores) and bottom-up resource limitation through drought and competition interact to influence savanna tree mortality and woody structure is unclear. Here, we compared the change in the number of large trees before and after a severe drought in a savanna with elephants (Loxodonta africana) and one without elephants. Elephants and drought both limited the number of large trees at our sites, but contrary to our predictions, there was no interactive effect of these drivers on overall changes in tree densities. However, there was a synergistic effect on the dominant tree species, Senegalia nigrescens, such that tree loss post-drought was greater where elephants were present compared to where they were absent. Hence, our results suggest that species-specific differences in drought resistance, as well as density-dependent factors, likely impact the severity of drought effects on savanna tree communities. In savannas, drought has the potential to exert strong control on tree survival and prevent canopy closure, thus partially filling the role of megaherbivores in limiting large trees when these consumers are absent. As drought severity and frequency are predicted to increase in the future, the influence of drought on savanna vegetation structure becomes increasingly important to consider.

AB Theoretically, species' characteristics should allow estimation of dispersal potential and, in turn, explain levels of population genetic differentiation. However, a mismatch between traits and genetic patterns is often reported for marine species, and interpreted as evidence that life-history traits do not influence dispersal. Here, we couple ecological and genomic methods to test the hypothesis that species with attributes favouring greater dispersal potential-e.g., longer pelagic duration, higher fecundity and larger population size-have greater realized dispersal overall. We used a natural experiment created by a large-scale and multispecies mortality event which created a "clean slate" on which to study recruitment dynamics, thus simplifying a usually complex problem. We surveyed four species of differing dispersal potential to quantify the abundance and distribution of recruits and to genetically assign these recruits to probable parental sources. Species with higher dispersal potential recolonized a broader extent of the impacted range, did so more quickly and recovered more genetic diversity than species with lower dispersal potential. Moreover, populations of taxa with higher dispersal potential exhibited more immigration (71%-92% of recruits) than taxa with lower dispersal potential (17%-44% of recruits). By linking ecological with genomic perspectives, we demonstrate that a suite of interacting life-history and demographic attributes do influence species' realized dispersal and genetic neighbourhoods. To better understand species' resilience and recovery in this time of global change, integrative eco-evolutionary approaches are needed to more rigorously evaluate the effect of dispersal-linked attributes on realized dispersal and population genetic differentiation.

AB Approximately 15% of the world's wetlands are rice fields, vital in providing food for 40% of the human population. Due to farming practices-induced habitat disturbances, rice cultivation acts as a habitat filter that retains only taxa possessing specific traits to overcome the constraints. Being aquatic biota, benthic macroinvertebrates are also impacted by the intermittent presence of water in rice fields. The biological traits and trait combinations of benthic macroinvertebrates enabling their existence during the rice cultivation cycle in seasonal rice fields of Maranchery Kole (The Ramsar site Vembanad Kole wetland's part) were studied. Based on the literature, 63 categories of 11 biological traits assignable at the genus level were used to characterize benthic macroinvertebrates. The taxa by traits data matrix was subjected to Gower's distance-based hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to categorize faunal groups with similar trait assembly. According to the abundance weighted trait modality scores, the predominant traits were small body size, life duration of more than 1 year, multivoltine life cycle, aquatic larval stage, aquatic passive dispersal, cocoons as resistant form, locomotion by full water swimming, tegumental respiration, asexual reproduction, detritus as food and deposit-feeding. Trait-based classification of taxa resulted in 5 clusters. Characteristic trait combinations in each cluster particularly those beneficial for survival in unstable lentic freshwaters enabled the existence of taxa. Cluster I, the most abundant group (oligochaetes), was benefited from trait combinations including resistance forms to survive the intermittent presence of water in rice fields. Asexual reproduction and early onset of reproduction ensured their higher abundance from the transplanting phase. Detrital feeding also facilitated their rapid buildup in newly flooded fields rich in decomposing detritus. Cluster groups II and III, actively flying colonists characterized by competitive traits like predation, were more in tillering and preharvest phases. Apart from resistant and resilient traits ensuring survival in the temporary and disturbed habitat, exclusive trait combinations favored the faunal groups through different phases.

AB In island systems, nitrogen-rich seabird guano is a marine subsidy that can shape terrestrial plant communities. In zones of nutrient upwelling such as the Gulf of California, copious seabird guano is commonplace on bird islands. Several bird islands host regionally unique cactus forests, especially of the large columnar cactus, cardon (Pachycereus pringlei). We show that a chain of interactions across the land-sea interface yields an allochthonous input of nitrogen in the form of seabird guano, fueling the production of some of the densest cactus populations in the world. Fish, seabird, guano, soil, and cactus samples were taken from the representative seabird island of San Pedro Martir for nitrogen stable isotope ratio measurements, which were compared to soil and cactus samples from other seabird and non-seabird Gulf islands and terrestrial ecosystems throughout the range of the cardon. Isla San Pedro Martir delta N-15 values are distinctively high, ranging from fish + 17.7, seabird + 19.7, guano + 14.8, soil + 34.3 and cactus + 30.3 compared to average values across non-bird sites of + 13.0 (N = 213, S.D. = 3.7) for soil and + 9.8 (N = 212, S.D. = 3.4) for cactus. These delta N-15 values are among the highest ever reported for plants. Seabird island soil and cactus delta N-15 values were consistently significantly enriched relative to mainland and non-bird islands, a relationship expected due to the progressive volatilization of N-14 rich ammonia from decomposing guano deposits. Our findings demonstrate that seabird-mediated marine nutrient deposits provide the source for solubilized nitrogen on desert islands, which stimulate terrestrial plant production in the cardon cactus beyond that seen in either mainland ecosystems or non-seabird islands.

AB The combination of molecular tools, standard surveying techniques, and long-term monitoring programs are relevant to understanding environmental and ecological changes in coral reef communities. Here we studied temporal variability in cryptobenthic coral reef communities across the continental shelf in the central Red Sea spanning 6 years (three sampling periods: 2013-2019) and including the 2015 mass bleaching event. We used a combination of molecular tools (barcoding and metabarcoding) to assess communities on Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) as a standardized sampling approach. Community composition associated with ARMS for both methodologies (barcoding and metabarcoding) was statistically different across reefs (shelf position) and time periods. The partition of beta diversity showed a higher turnover and lower nestedness between pre-bleaching and post-bleaching samples than between the two post-bleaching periods, revealing a community shift from the bleaching event. However, a slight return to the pre-bleaching community composition was observed in 2019 suggesting a recovery trajectory. Given the predictions of decreasing time between bleaching events, it is concerning that cryptobenthic communities may not fully recover and communities with new characteristics will emerge. We observed a high turnover among reefs for all time periods, implying a homogenization of the cryptobiome did not occur across the cross shelf following the 2015 bleaching event. It is possible that dispersal limitations and the distinct environmental and benthic structures present across the shelf maintained the heterogeneity in communities among reefs. This study has to the best of our knowledge presented for the first time a temporal aspect into the analysis of ARMS cryptobenthic coral reef communities and encompasses a bleaching event. We show that these structures can detect cryptic changes associated with reef degradation and provides support for these being used as long-term monitoring tools.

AB Assessing the spatiotemporal behaviour of alien species is pivotal to designing effective management plans. Interspecific niche partitioning among ungulates is reported as a strategy to avoid direct interactions. The Mediterranean mouflon and wild boar are two ungulates introduced to Elba island for hunting and aesthetic purposes. We used intensive camera trapping to test whether species occupancy and temporal activity rhythms would vary in response to the presence or absence of the co-occurring species through multi-species occupancy modelling. Our findings report a lack of spatial and temporal segregation between the two species for the late spring-summer and late summer-autumn seasons. In contrast, results for the winter-early spring period suggest that spatial partitioning between wild boar and mouflon is present in areas with high artificial cover (e.g., paved roads). Animals may indeed exploit roads to move more rapidly in search of food; however, their occurrence in these areas seems to be influenced by the presence of the other species.

AB Climate change can enhance or hinder the spread of invasive plant species, as climatic conditions influence the population dynamics of invaders in their new range. Pines are one of the most widely distributed and problematic invasive tree species globally. Here we experimentally evaluated how two invasive pine species (Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta) respond to simulated climate change conditions in northwestern Patagonia. We conducted a full factorial manipulative field experiment with 3-year-old pine saplings growing in warmed (Open Top Chamber), watered, warmed + watered, and control treatments. In the warmed treatments P. contorta saplings showed lower survival and tended to grow taller while maintaining their root growth. In contrast, P. ponderosa saplings, which did not show differences in survival among treatments, did not vary their aerial growth under warmed conditions, but tended to increase their root-to-shoot ratio. Both species showed similar survival and growth in the watered treatments compared to the control, indicating that the implemented difference in water (ca. 30% during the growing season) had no significant effect. Our findings suggest that a decrease in the invasive capacity (initial stages) of P. contorta may occur under climate change but no significant changes are expected for P. ponderosa. This observed differential response may modify the current relative abundance of invading pine species in northwestern Patagonia and has implications for the response of invasive species to climate change elsewhere.

AB The origin of Dahomey Gap (DG) flora is one of the central biogeographical questions in sub-Saharan, which has been addressed in several studies. However, floristic evidence based on representative samples from the DG seems to be lacking in the scientific debate. The present study was conducted to fill this gap. Specifically, we assessed Togolese mountain riparian forests as minor forest refugia, examined their contribution to larger sub-Saharan forest refugia, and discussed the significance of these findings for biogeography and biodiversity conservation. Southwest Togo, West Africa, and sub-Saharan Upper Guinea Region Floristic data were collected in riparian forests through an intensive botanical inventory (n = 198; 50 x 10 m(2)). A comparative analysis was performed based on the floristic evidence related to forest refuges. The results showed significantly high species richness (868 species) and a high gamma and beta diversity associated with spatial turnover patterns. They also showed a high affinity between the study forests and large sub-Saharan forest refugia. Riparian forests share about 60% of their current species richness with large sub-Saharan forest refugia and contained refuge bio-indicator species. The floristic evidence, consistent with those of other studies, suggests that Togolese mountains would have very ancient origins and have experienced paleoclimatic events. The studied riparian would have served as refuges during recurrent climatic episodes. Our results support the minimal forest fragmentation hypothesis (network of refugia along rivers). However, they seem to be incompatible with the idea that the DG flora may be essentially a relic of the early Holocene. In sub-Saharan Africa, where maintaining a vast area of natural forest is difficult due to human pressure, efforts to preserve maximum species diversity should include a focus on the conservation of minor forest refuges, particularly in sub-humid mountain riparian zone.

AB Context Management for positive biodiversity outcomes under a changing climate requires a shift of perspective relative to traditional conservation. Here we develop a repeatable indicator for measuring the capacity of landscapes to retain biodiversity under a range of plausible climate futures, as a function of the condition and spatial configuration of native habitat. Methods The Spatial Resilience Index extends an existing approach to assessing the potential for biodiversity associated with any location in a region to access suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape under climate change, incorporating multiple dispersal rates integrated over time and an optimised spatial structure. Derivation of the indicator is demonstrated for an Australian case study, covering the entire State of New South Wales, drawing on existing spatial datasets and models. Results Mapping of the Spatial Resilience Index across New South Wales suggests that different regions, and locations within these regions, vary markedly in their expected capacity to retain biodiversity, depending on the direct rate of climate change, the degree of climatic buffering (or reduction of climate velocity) afforded by landscape heterogeneity, and the degree of anthropogenic impacts on the connectedness of habitat in the landscape. The developed approach accounts for the interplay between these processes by treating them within a unified framework. Conclusions The index highlights areas which can potentially benefit from adaptive management (e.g. habitat restoration) to enhance capacity to retain biodiversity under climate change, and offers an objective means of monitoring any resulting change in this capacity over time.

AB Decentralisation of environmental governance (DEG) proliferated around the world in the 1990s, inspired, in part, by theories of common-pool resource governance that argued that local communities could sustainably manage valuable but non-excludable resources given a set of proper institutional design principles. However, many species of wildlife, such as predators that consume livestock or herbivores that destroy crops, are considered undesirable by local communities; this challenges the applicability of DEG models for managing wildlife in these contexts. Numerous scholars have proposed methods to generate economic value from locally undesired wildlife species to incentivise their conservation, but the overall success of these approaches has been mixed. We explore the intersection of DEG and the management of wildlife entangled in human-wildlife conflict and challenge the assumption that simple models of devolution and decentralisation will lead to the successful governance of wildlife in such circumstances. We argue that conflict species governance is potentially compatible with DEG but requires a fuller consideration of institutions at multiple scales than is typically included in common-pool resource theory or decentralisation. Multiple mechanisms of accountability may be especially important in securing the conservation of wildlife in conflict scenarios.

AB QuestionsHow does desert grassland vegetation respond to long-term grazing removal? Is grass response the result of differences in the number or the size of plants? Does the response differ over time and in relation to precipitation patterns?LocationSanta Rita Experimental Range, southwestern United States.MethodsFour times between 2011 and 2020, we measured the cover of woody plants and native and non-native perennial grasses, and the density, size, and biomass of individual perennial grasses on 40 permanent transects inside and outside 10 long-term (88-104 years old) livestock exclosures (0.1-4.0 ha) occurring on the same ecological site. We used linear mixed models to compare vegetation variables in grazed vs ungrazed transects through time and calculated the cumulative frequency distributions of grass plant diameters.ResultsThe cover of woody plants did not differ by grazing treatment. Instead, the exclosures had a greater cover, density, and biomass of native grasses and cover and biomass of the most abundant native grass Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica). Moreover, ungrazed populations of natives and Arizona cottontop showed a plant size structure skewed to larger sizes. Non-native grasses showed no differences between grazing treatments. Patterns of inter-annual precipitation influenced woody and grass plant abundance, but not their response to livestock removal.ConclusionsLong-term grazing removal in desert grasslands affected native grass abundance, but not that of non-native grasses and woody plants. Response of native grasses to livestock removal was characterized more by plant size rather than the number of plants, and, importantly, the population size structure skewed to smaller plants in grazed areas suggests that grazing limits plant vigor and longevity. Absence of a non-native grass response likely reflects lower palatability and greater grazing resistance of non-natives. Absence of woody plant response is due to their low palatability and the permeability of exclosures to seed dispersal.

AB Laelia is an endemic genus of the neotropical region, with the greatest richness occurring in Mexico. A recent phylogenetic study transferred some Mexican laelias to the genus Schomburgkia, which has generated debate. The aim of the present study was to analyze the patterns of species richness and endemism and the current and potential geographic distributions of the taxa of Laelia s.l., as well as the putative Laelia s.s., distributed in Mexico as part of an exploratory evaluation of the generic limits to sheds light on the taxonomic debate and generate baselines to guide conservation efforts. A database was generated with information from herbarium specimens and publications. The species richness was estimated by political division, biomes, and elevation. The endemism was analyzed by political division and using the weighted and corrected weighted endemism indices. Geographic data, climatic, and topographic variables were used to predict the distributions with the maximum entropy algorithm. The results supported the proposal to transfer some species to the genus Schomburgkia. Some areas of the Sierra Madre del Sur and Oriental should be included as priority areas in the conservation strategies of Laelia. This study highlights the importance of the taxonomy, distribution, and hotspots in diversity conservation.

AB The common squid Todarodes pacificus is a dominant species within epipelagic communities and an important commercial species in the South and East seas of Korea and in the East China Sea. In this study, to examine the dietary composition, trophic position, and ontogenetic dietary shifts of the common squid, we analyzed stomach contents and stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in muscle tissue across different body sizes (mantle length, ML) and seasons (winter, spring, and summer 2021) in the South Sea of Korea. Regardless of the season, the diet of the common squid predominantly comprised Pisces (37.9-94.0%) and Cephalopoda (6.0-61.0%). However, in the smallest individuals (ML < 10 cm), the stomach contents in August primarily comprised Crustacea (95.5%), thereby indicating a seasonal difference in dietary composition and ontogenetic dietary shifts only during summer. Similarly, our isotope results revealed seasonal isotopic variation among sampling periods and significant positive correlations between ML and both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values during the summer. These results reveal a seasonal variability in major diet components among the common squid of different size classes and that their feeding strategies are probably adjusted in response to the temporal availability of prey. Collectively, the findings of this study enhance our understanding of the feeding ecology of T. pacificus and thereby provide valuable information that will contribute to the ecological fishery management of this commercially important species.

AB As multiple invaders often co-occur, understanding the interactions between different invasive species is important. Previous studies have reported on invasional meltdown and neutral and interference relationships between invasive species. However, interspecific interactions may vary with environmental change owing to the different responses of interacting invaders. To better understand the interaction of notorious invasive alien plants under CO2 enrichment and N deposition, the growth characteristics of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) were studied when they were planted in monoculture (4Rag and 4Pig) or mixture (1Rag:3Pig, 2Rag:2Pig, 3Rag:1Pig) under four environmental treatments: elevated CO2, increased N, elevated CO2 + increased N and a control. Increased N positively affected almost all the traits (basal stem diameter, height, shoot biomass, root biomass and total biomass) of common ragweed, except for branch number and root-shoot ratio. But increased N only promoted redroot pigweed's height and basal stem diameter. interspecific competition promoted basal stem diameter and number of branches but decreased root biomass of common ragweed, and the basal stem diameter was significantly higher in 1Rag:3Pig and 2Rag:2Pig compared to the other two treatments. interspecific competition inhibited almost all the characteristics of redroot pigweed. The interaction between elevated CO2 and increased N also increased the biomass characteristics (shoot biomass, root biomass and total biomass) of common ragweed. However, elevated CO2 inhibited the root biomass of redroot pigweed. The results indicated that common ragweed was a superior competitor under conditions of elevated CO2 and increased N. Moreover, environmental change might strengthen the super-invasive plant common ragweed's competitive ability.

AB The spatial distribution of plant communities in the Grassland biome is influenced by multiple environmental variables such as climate, topography, geology, soil, and other ecological processes such as fire and grazing. This study focuses on mapping the grassland plant communities in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and determining the environmental factors influencing their spatial distribution.For vegetation classification, the TWINSPAN algorithm was firstly used to do a floristic analysis of 209 sampling plots and refined further using the Braun-Blanquet procedures and JUICE programmes. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the most important environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of the grassland communities. Environmental spatial data were sourced from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and soil grid databases. The fire frequency was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burn area index 2001-2017, and the remote-sensing-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for February 2020 was computed from 2001 to 2020 MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index The phytosociological analysis of the vegetation data resulted in nine major plants communities and five subcommunities. Our GLM analysis showed elevation, clay content, VCI, and fire frequency to be significant at a 95% confidence level and positively correlated with the grassland communities. Soil nitrogen was also significant but negatively correlated with the grassland communities (Z -value = -9.710, p = 0.33).The Spearman Rank Correlation showed a significant but weakly positive correlation between most of the environmental variables (r < 0.5). The identification and understanding of plant communities, as well as their associated environmental drivers, are of fundamental importance in the formulation and execution of biodiversity conservation strategies for the park. The data can also be used in climate change studies and also to monitor vegetation change over time.

AB In Scotland, bivalves are widely distributed. However, their larvae dispersion is still largely unknown and difficult to assess in situ. And, while Mytilus spp. dominate shellfish production, it is mostly dependent on natural spat recruitment from wild populations. Understanding the larval distribution pattern would safeguard natural resources while also ensuring sustainable farming practises. The feasibility of a model that simulates biophysical interactions between larval behaviour and ocean motions was investigated. We employed an unstructured tri-dimensional hydrodynamic model (finite volume coastal ocean model) to drive a particle tracking model, where prediction of larval movement and dispersal at defined locations might aid in population monitoring and spat recruitment. Our findings reveal a strong link between larval distribution and meteorological factors such as wind forces and currents velocity. The model, also, depicts a fast and considerable larval movement, resulting in a substantial mix of plankton and bivalve larvae, forming a large connection between the southern and northern regions of Scotland's West coast. This enables us to forecast the breeding grounds of any area of interest, potentially charting connectivity between cultivated and wild populations. These results have significant implications for the dynamics of ecologically and economically important species, such as population growth and loss, harvesting and agricultural management in the context of climate change, and sustainable shellfish fisheries management. Furthermore, the observations on Scottish water flow suggest that tracking particles with similar behaviour to bivalve larvae, such as other pelagic larval stages of keystone species and potential pathogens such as sea lice, may have policy and farming implications, as well as disease control amid global warming issues.

AB When invasive tubenose gobies (Proterorhinus semilunaris) and round gobies (Neogobius melanosotmus) occur in the same invaded ecosystem, the first is almost always displaced by the latter. Here, we report on a series of habitat-oriented laboratory experiments and field surveys aimed at revealing mechanisms that allowed coexistence of both species along the River Dyje (Danube basin). The experiments suggested that (i) both gobiids prefer the same habitat type, i.e., interstitial shelters between rocks, (ii) round goby is stronger, more aggressive competitor and (iii) round goby presence results in shift in tubenose goby habitat use. Field sampling indicated that round and tubenose gobies tended to occupy different microhabitats both along the longitudinal and lateral profile. Tubenose goby was found most often in shallow, near-bank rip-rap composed of smaller rocks, while round goby occurred most often in deeper areas with gravel substrates, larger rocks and faster current. Both species avoided the faster-flowing stretch in the middle of the river. Similar complementarity was also noted in temporal activity patterns, with round goby least active during the night and tubenose goby during the day. Our findings suggest that fine-scale niche separation facilitates the coexistence of these two invasive species, despite large 'broad-scale' niche overlap.

AB During recent decades, bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) have continuously expanded their range in the Mediterranean climate regions of Israel. To assess their potential effects on local bee communities, we monitored their diurnal and seasonal activity patterns, as well as those of native bee species in the Judean Hills. We found that all bee species tend to visit pollen-providing flowers at earlier times compared to nectar-providing flowers. Bumble bees and honey bees start foraging at earlier times and colder temperatures compared to other species of bees. This means that the two species of commercially managed social bees are potentially depleting much of the pollen, which is typically non-replenished, before most local species arrive to gather it. Taking into consideration the long activity season of bumble bees in the Judean hills, their ability to forage at the low temperatures of the early morning, and their capacity to collect pollen at early hours in the dry Mediterranean climate, feral and range-expanding bumble bees potentially pose a significant competitive pressure on native bee fauna. Their effects on local bees can further modify pollination networks, and lead to changes in the local flora.

AB Frequent grazing can establish high forage value grazing lawns supporting high grazer densities, but can also produce overgrazed grass communities with unpalatable or low grass basal cover, supporting few grazers. Attempts to create grazing lawns via concentrated grazing, with a goal to increase grazer numbers, are thus risky without knowing how environmental conditions influence the likelihood of each outcome. We collected grass species and trait data from 33 frequently grazed grass communities across eastern South Africa (28 sites) and the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania (five sites), covering wide rainfall (336-987 mm year(-1)) and soil (e.g., 44%-93% sand) gradients. We identified four grass growth forms using hierarchical clustering on principal components analyses of trait data and assessed trait-environment and growth form-environment relationships using fourth corner and principal components analyses. We distinguished two palatable grass growth forms that both attract yet resist grazers and comprise grazing lawns: (1) "lateral attractors" that spread vegetatively via stolons and rhizomes, and (2) "tufted attractors" that form isolated tufts and may have alternate tall growth forms. By contrast, (3) tough, upright, tufted "resisters," and (4) "avoiders" with sparse architectures or that grow appressed to the soil surface, are of little forage value and avoided by grazers. Grazing lawns occurred across a wide range of conditions, typically comprising lateral attractor grasses in drier, sandy environments, and tufted attractor grasses in wetter, low-sand environments. Resisters occurred on clay-rich soils in mesic areas, while avoiders were widespread but scarce. While grazing lawns can be established under most conditions, monitoring their composition and cover is important, as the potential for overgrazing seems as widely relevant. Tufted attractor-dominated lawns appear somewhat more vulnerable to degradation than lateral attractor-dominated lawns. Increased avoider and resister abundance both reduce forage value, although resisters may provide better soil protection.

AB Colicodendron scabridum, commonly known as " sapote", is one of the most common woody species in seasonally dry neotropical forests, and an important food for numerous animals. We investigated sapote's reproductive phenology and evaluated its relationship to temperature and precipitation. To do so, we installed seven 2 m x 300 m transects, each with fifteen focal individual sapote trees, at seven sites from 257 - 353 m at Cerro Venado, Lambayeque, Peru. The duration of flowering and fruiting varied among individuals, sites, and years. On average, 85-97 % of individuals with flowers bore fruit. The average fruiting period was shorter than the average flowering period, which it followed three months later. We used a cross correlation test to evaluate the relationship between flowering, and fruiting, with the monthly average temperature and precipitation. Sapote flowering changed in opposition to monthly average temperature, with a strong inverse correlation between flowering and temperature. In contrast, the frequency of individuals with fruits was positively correlated with temperature. There was no relationship between monthly precipitation with either flowering or fruiting. Our results suggest that temperature may determine when the species reproduces, thus affecting food availability for wildlife. The phenological variations we recorded are relevant to decisions for the conservation of this species.

AB Invasion by alien trees and shrubs has been well documented in many regions of the world, and horticulture and forestry are the main pathways of their introduction. A lack of proper management and control of cultivated alien trees and shrubs can lead to their establishment and invasion in new areas. The early detection of alien woody species outside cultivation is crucial for their control and protection of native habitats. Prunus virginiana is a North American shrub or small tree cultivated and established in a few countries in Europe. It is considered invasive in the state of Alaska in the United States, as well as in Sweden and Central European Russia. It forms dense thickets that can outcompete native vegetation, impair visibility and limit access to recreational areas. In this paper, we present a new record of P. virginiana in north-eastern Poland, with a new range extension of about 300 km in the east from known spontaneous localities in Central Europe. The status of the species in Polish flora is discussed.

AB Knowledge of the introduction history and spread dynamics of invasive species can provide important insights for management (Ens et al. in Environ Rev (in press), 2022), however such information is often unavailable for accidental introductions. Here we infer how the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, and its congener, the Mediterranean shore crab, C. aestuarii, were introduced to and spread within South Africa. We do this using nuclear microsatellite data and Bayesian assignment tests and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) modelling that included samples from the native and other invasive ranges of these two species. We also compared the genetic diversity and structure of one of the South African populations during and after intensive management, with that of another, unmanaged, population. South African populations had higher genetic diversity than invasive Carcinus populations from elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the ABC analyses suggest that South African populations originated from an admixture event between individuals of C. maenas from a population in the native range and an invasive population from Canada. We also identified instances of hybridisation between Carcinus maenas and C. aestuarii in South Africa. South African populations showed no genetic structure, suggesting either extensive migration between them or that populations arose from the same initial introduction. Management of Carcinus did not affect genetic diversity or structure, and we suspect that the management duration was insufficient to target a full generation of crabs. Together these results suggest multiple introductions and/or high propagule pressure to South Africa, crab (larval or adult) movement between existing populations, and some hybridisation. For eradication from South Africa to be achieved, management would need to concurrently target all known invasive populations and clearly establish that new introductions could be prevented.

AB Grassland ecosystems are species-rich habitats that are rapidly declining globally posing serious concerns for biodiversity conservation. This situation is particularly relevant in agricultural areas in Europe. As traditional management practices and livestock grazing regimes ceased, rewilding could be a potential avenue to tackle current biodiversity declines. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year experiment where 12 horses were introduced in three 10-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). Horses were kept without supplementary feeding to mimic ecosystem functions of wild horses. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models and a backward stepwise model selection procedure to elucidate factors that modulate insect richness induced by grazing. Our results show that plant species richness, the proportion of flowers and plant height play a significant role for butterfly and bumblebee richness, while the opposite effect was detected for grasshoppers. However, the effect on grasshoppers was counterbalanced by increased grasshopper species richness in habitats adjacent to horse latrines. Implications for insect conservation Rewilding with horses may offset current biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems. Horse grazing can however have different effects on diverse functional groups of insects. Application of integrative landscape scale approaches may be needed to elucidate the effects of rewilding for certain functional groups such as grasshoppers. With current biodiversity declines, up-scaling rewilding research and practice might be crucial to mitigate the pervasive effects on insects as their services and functions are critical for our existence.

AB Environmental pollution by microplastics has become a severe problem in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and, according to actual prognoses, problems will further increase in the future. Therefore, assessing and quantifying the risk for the biota is crucial. Standardized short-term toxicological procedures as well as methods quantifying potential toxic effects over the whole life span of an animal are required. We studied the effect of the microplastic polystyrene on the survival and reproduction of a common freshwater invertebrate, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, at different timescales. We used pristine polystyrene spheres of 1, 3, and 6 mu m diameter and fed them to the animals together with food algae in different ratios ranging from 0 to 50% nonfood particles. As a particle control, we used silica to distinguish between a pure particle effect and a plastic effect. After 24 h, no toxic effect was found, neither with polystyrene nor with silica. After 96 h, a toxic effect was detectable for both particle types. The size of the particles played a negligible role. Studying the long-term effect by using life table experiments, we found a reduced reproduction when the animals were fed with 3 mu m spheres together with similar-sized food algae. We conclude that the fitness reduction is mainly driven by the dilution of food by the nonfood particles rather than by a direct toxic effect.

AB Probiotics or direct-fed microbials (DFM) have proven strong potential for improving aquaculture sustainability. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with the DFM Bacillus amyloliquefaciens US573 on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and gut microbiota (GM) of European sea bass. For this purpose, healthy fish were divided into two feeding trials in triplicate of 25 fish in each tank. The fish were fed with a control basal diet or a DFM-supplemented diet for 42 days. Results showed that, while no significant effects on growth performance were observed, the length and abundance of villi were higher in the DFM-fed group. The benefic effects of DFM supplementation included also the absence of cysts formation and the increase in number of goblet cells playing essential role in immune response. Through DNA metabarcoding analysis of GM, 5 phyla and 14 major genera were identified. At day 42, the main microbiome changes in response to B. amyloliquefaciens US573 addition included the significant decrease in abundance of Actinobacteria phylum that perfectly correlates with a decrease in Nocardia genus representatives which represent serious threat in marine and freshwater fish. On the contrary, an obvious dominance of Betaproteobacteria associated with the abundance in Variovorax genus members, known for their ability to metabolize numerous substrates, was recorded. Interestingly, Firmicutes, particularly species affiliated to the genus Sporosarcina with recent promising probiotic potential, were identified as the most abundant. These results suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens US573 can be effectively recommended as health-promoting DFM in European sea bass farming.

AB Increasing nitrogen deposition plays a critical role in the material circulation of grassland. Mowing and grazing sheep are important means of utilizing grassland. This study investigated the effects of nitrogen deposition, sheep grazing and mowing on the soil, vegetation and soil microorganisms of grassland. N deposition increased soil inorganic nitrogen, SOM and microbial activity, and decreased soil pH, while grazing sheep and mowing had opposing effects. Compared with mowing, grazing sheep decreased the range of grass groups in the community. N deposition increased the proportion of Leymus chinensis in the community and decreased community diversity. N deposition enhanced the contribution rate of soil to the vegetation community, and reduced the effect of microorganisms on the vegetation community. In addition, N deposition significantly interacted with mowing and grazing sheep in terms of effects on soil inorganic nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), microbial respiration (Q), microbial mass carbon (MBC), and vegetation diversity. Therefore, appropriate N deposition in sheep grazing and mown grasslands could enhance inorganic N and organic matter, increase microbial activity, offset the adverse effects of grazing sheep and mowing, and contribute to maintaining community diversity and grassland productivity.

TI Disentangling structural and functional responses of native versus alien
   communities by canonical ordination analyses and variation partitioning
   with multiple matrices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Freshwaters are under accelerated human pressure, and mollusk communities are among its most sensitive, threatened, and valuable components. To the best of our knowledge, the overall effects of damming, environment, space, time, and invasive alien mollusk species, on structural and functional responses of native mollusk communities were not yet compared. Using historical information and recent data from a river, we aimed to investigate and disentangle these effects and evaluate the differences in structural and functional responses of natives and alien invasives to the same predictors. Variation partitioning showed that alien species were as important predictors as were environmental factors and time in explaining species composition of native freshwater mollusk communities. Aliens were more independent of environmental conditions than natives and responded to different drivers, partially explaining their invasion success. The increased abundance of some alien gastropods was positively related to taxonomic diversity, while certain alien bivalves were negatively associated with the functional diversity of native communities. We introduce a cumulative variation partitioning with multiple response (native and alien) and predictor matrices, along with a diagram to show their relations, advocating for a conceptual shift in future community ecology, from "variables to matrices" and from "multivariate analyses to multi-matrix statistical modeling".

AB Despite nutrient enrichment having widely reported negative impacts on biodiversity, fertilizer is routinely applied in post mining restoration to enhance plant growth and establishment. Focusing on surface mine restoration (predominately bauxite and mineral sands), we outline the long-term negative impacts of fertilizer, particularly phosphorus fertilizer, on plant community composition, species richness, fire fuel loads, and belowground impacts on nutrient-cycling. We draw from extensive research in south-western Australia and further afield, noting the geographical coincidence of surface mining, phosphorus impoverished soil and high plant biodiversity. We highlight the trade-offs between rapid plant-growth under fertilisation and the longer-term effects on plant communities and diversity. We note that the initial growth benefits of fertilisation may not persist in water-limited environments: growth of unfertilised forests can eventually match that of fertilised forest, throwing doubt on the premise that fertilisation is necessary at all.

AB Livestock grazing is a globally important land use and has the potential to significantly influence plant community structure and ecosystem function, yet several critical knowledge gaps remain on the direction and magnitude of grazing impacts. Furthermore, much of our understanding of the long-term effects on plant community composition and structure are based on grazer exclusion experiments, which explicitly avoid characterizing effects along grazing intensity gradients. We sampled big sagebrush plant communities using 68 plots located along grazing intensity gradients to determine how grazing intensity influences multiple aspects of plant community structure over time. This was accomplished by sampling plant communities at different distances from 17 artificial watering sources, using distance from water and cow dung density as proxies for grazing intensity at individual plots. Total vegetation cover and total grass cover were negatively related to grazing intensity, and cover of annual forbs, exotic cover, and exotic richness were positively related to grazing intensity. In contrast, species richness and composition, bunchgrass biomass, shrub density and size, percentage cover of bare ground, litter, and biological soil crusts did not vary along our grazing intensity gradients, in spite of our expectations to the contrary. Our results suggest that the effects of livestock grazing over multiple decades (mean = 46 years) in our sites are relatively small, especially for native perennial species, and that the big sagebrush plant communities we sampled are somewhat resistant to livestock grazing. Collectively, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that indicates the stability of the big sagebrush plant functional type composition under current grazing management regimes.

AB Morphological niche partitioning between related syntopic plants that are distylous (with short- and long-styled morphs) is complex. Owing to differences in the heights of stigmas and anthers, each floral morph must place pollen onto two distinct parts of the body of the pollinator. This led us to hypothesize that such partitioning should be more accurate among distylous syntopic species in comparison to combinations with other related plants that do not co-occur. We tested these assumptions using a set of Palicourea (Rubiaceae) species as a model system. We compared the distribution, flowering phenology, floral measurements and reciprocity of sexual organ heights of two syntopic species (Palicourea rigida and Palicourea coriacea) and one non-syntopic congener (Palicourea marcgravii). The three species overlapped in their distributions and flowering periods. The position of sexual organs was, in most cases, partitioned between syntopic populations, with low overlap in anther and stigma heights. However, we found a higher overlap involving the non-syntopic species, especially between Palicourea rigida and Palicourea marcgravii. Additionally, reciprocity of sexual organs was more accurate in intraspecific inter-morph combinations (i.e. legitimate organ correspondence) in comparison to intraspecific intra-morph, interspecific syntopic and interspecific non-syntopic combinations. The partitioning of morphological traits between syntopic species might facilitate the differential placement of pollen on the body of the pollinator and reduce the chances of interspecific interference.

We used DNA barcoding and molecular species identification to investigate the species diversity and distribution of crustacean larvae in the Zhongsha Islands waters, South China Sea. In total, 108 sequences were obtained from crustacean larvae collected in the Zhongsha Islands waters in 2019 using vertical hauls between the depths of 5 and 200 m. The molecular classification approach confirmed that 108 sequences represented crustaceans typical to the South China Sea, with 70 species identified, representing 43 genera, 23 families, and 4 orders. However, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences of only 27 species identified from the larval samples matched with available sequences taken from adults in GenBank. The comparison of K2P distances yielded a notable gap of 3.5-10.7% between intraspecific and interspecific distances across the sequence dataset. More than 80% of the crustacean larvae species belonged to the order Decapoda, and they displayed marked differences in their distributionsin the Zhongshan Islands waters. The orders Calanoida and Amphipoda were represented by the fewest species, which were recorded only at the edge of the Zhongsha Atoll.

AB Climate change is expected to alter impacts of invasive alien species (IAS). As omnivores and ectotherms, invasive crayfish species (ICS) can be particularly influenced by altered thermal regimes with possible impacts on native species and key ecosystem processes, such as leaf-litter breakdown. We performed a controlled study using a multi-trophic approach to assess the individual and combined effects between two ICS (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii) on leaf-litter breakdown under temperature increase (15 and 18 degrees C). We used aquaria with one or two species combinations of ICS (2-individuals per aquarium); each aquarium contained transparent cages with three individuals of a native invertebrate detritivore (Sericostoma sp.). All aquaria had a fine-mesh bag containing microbially-colonized oak leaves to assess direct and indirect impacts of crayfish on leaf-litter breakdown and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) production. Leaf-litter breakdown driven by microbes and Sericostoma was affected by temperature. Increasing temperature enhanced leaf-litter breakdown and FPOM production by P. clarkii, but not by P. leniusculus. At 15 degrees C, leaf breakdown was lower in treatments with both ICS than the expected from their individual performances, which may suggest competitive interactions between crayfish species. FPOM production was significantly correlated with leaf-litter breakdown, but not in treatments with both ICS. Our results suggest that competitive interactions between ICS may occur and potentially attenuate their impacts on key ecological processes. However, predicted increases in temperature may change the performance of IAS and increase the magnitude of their combined effects.

AB Silviculture is among the human activities that contribute most to fragmentation and habitat loss. The comprehension of the effects of such activity on the environment is crucial for conservation. Here, we assessed the effects of silviculture on the local distribution of Contomastix vacariensis, an endemic lizard from southern Brazil. We used a single-season occupancy model in a Bayesian framework to estimate the occupancy probability of the species in 69 sites with different distances from silviculture areas. Our data showed a low probability of occupancy of C. vacariensis within a distance smaller than 1000 m from silviculture areas, while detection probability was negatively influenced by wind speed. This is the first work to demonstrate a gradual negative effect of exotic silviculture in lizards, which may be more intense inside planted areas and decrease as the distance from the exotic plantation increases. Such results may help delimit the size of conservation areas and management of exotic silviculture species within these areas. Studies with similar methods, considering the distance from the effects of environmental impacts, can be a helpful tool to make predictions based on the projected growth of silviculture in natural areas supporting threatened species.

AB Previous research has yielded mixed findings on the relationship between facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR), an androgen-dependent feature, and risk-taking propensity. We argue that mixed findings might result from overlooked variables. Given that risk-taking propensity might be ultimately linked to a search for mating opportunities, we analyze if reproductive strategies moderate the relationship between fWHR and risk-taking propensity. Our results, obtained from a sample of 434 male participants, show a positive association between fWHR and recreational and social risk-taking only for men who are more motivated to focus on mating effort over offspring survival. This finding aligns with research arguing that risk-taking may be a mating strategy since being social and recreational risk-prone might illustrate physical and psychological qualities and improve one's ability to attract mates. Our results support the notion that risk-taking might be a domain-specific construct. Overall, our research is in line with recent findings suggesting that the impact of testosterone exposure on risk-taking propensity is best understood when considering the role of contextual variables. Consequently, we add to previous research that studies related to risk-taking propensity should account for reproductive strategies.

AB Wetlands in drylands are important resources for agriculture and wildlife, but competition may result in human-wildlife conflict. We sought to understand conditions under which people and wildlife sharing wetlands in drylands may coexist. We applied track counts in riverine wetlands in the dry and wet season (n = 36 days) using belt transects, focus group discussions (n = 3), key informant interviews (n = 26), a household socio-economic survey (n = 180) and secondary data analysis to study human-wildlife interactions in a community-based wildlife management area in Zimbabwe. Twenty-six wildlife species that used riverine wetlands were identified. High population density and riverine agriculture - with access to cattle and ploughs enabling cultivation of larger fields - limited wildlife access to wetlands. Seasonality, drought, water availability and soil fertility, aggravated by limited alternative livelihood opportunities and lack of political will to control cropping and settlement in wetlands, were drivers of conflict. Hence, models based on population pressure and resource availability are insufficient to inform human-wildlife conflict mitigation. Strategies that undercut rent-seeking behaviour are needed to enable human-wildlife coexistence. Concerted action among stakeholders including linking wildlife conservation benefits to compliance with wetland-use regulations, water-user committees, water provisioning and labour-saving technologies in uplands, livelihood diversification and incentivised production of drought-tolerant crops are recommended.

AB Studies on non-native epibionts typically focus on the organismal-level impacts of epibiosis on basibionts, rather than community-level impacts of this relationship. The purpose of our study was to evaluate if non-native basibionts in general facilitate invasions through epibiosis in Maine compared to native basibiont species. We collected 64 basibiont assemblages including replicate samples of 10 different basibiont taxa on the central Maine coast in October 2019. Each basibiont and associated epibionts were identified to genus, classified as native or non-native to the region where they were collected, and weighed. We found that while there was no association between invasion status of the epibiont and the basibiont, native basibionts had a significantly higher Shannon Diversity Index than non-native basibionts. Although diversity of epibionts was greater on native basibionts, the percentage of invaders varied across basibiont taxa. Specific basibiont taxon characteristics may be more important than status because different taxa have different surface topographies, resulting in varying settlement among epibiont species. Our study indicates that there is differential settlement of epibiont taxa across basibiont taxa, which may help predict, based on surface characteristics, which species support more epibiont taxa. This study, as a snapshot of floating dock fouling communities within a 10 km radius, may indicate that non-native basibionts play a role in changing community structure. Expanding the scope of this initial study to include a wider taxonomic and geographic range should help determine if epibiosis is truly a facilitative process in invasions.

AB A 6-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of adding sodium butyrate (SB) and tributyrin (TBT) on the growth performance, digestion enzyme, and intestinal microbial flora of shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The control (CON) group was fed a basal diet, and the SB group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.2% SB, while the TBT group was fed a basal diet supplement with 0.05% TBT. At the end of the feeding trial, higher growth performance and lower feed conversion ratio were observed in the SB and TBT groups. Meanwhile, the alpha diversity index (Shannon and Chao1) was lower in SB and higher in TBT group, respectively. In addition, the intestinal microbiota was modified. For instance, the abundance of the beneficial bacteria Pseudomonas was enriched, while the contents of potential pathogens were inhibited. Furthermore, compared with the CON group, the activity of protease and amylase in the hepatopancreas was improved in the SB and TBT groups. The activity of alkaline phosphatase and phenol oxidase was significantly increased in the SB and TBT groups. Taken together, dietary supplementation with TB and TBT could improve the growth performance and reduce the relative abundance of harmful bacteria, and TBT was superior to SB in improving the growth of shrimp.

AB It is difficult to assess the population status of large terrestrial carnivores due to their low density. Recently adopted camera-trap techniques allow us to investigate many aspects of animal ecology and conservation and are widely used in wildlife population estimation. In this study, we applied the random encounter model (REM) to estimate the density of Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) in Shirakawa Village, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, from May to October 2018. We installed 24 sensor cameras in the study area. Movement speeds of seven global positioning system (GPS)-collared bears were tracked from 2008 to 2018. The population density of bears in Shirakawa Village was estimated to be 0.55 bears/km(2). To apply the REM method to Asiatic black bears, we recommend (1) installing more than 30 or 40 sensor cameras and implementing the REM method in a period of 3 weeks before the late summer season (i.e. late August), after the completion of the hibernation period and when a closed population is easily maintained; and (2) correcting the distance moved by the target animal species when using GPS telemetry with a low fixed interval.

AB Shallow estuarine habitats are well recognized for providing a positive correlation to the abundance and diversity of juvenile fish species. This has been associated with the hypotheses of refuge from predators and the availability of food. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the importance of two adjacent habitats to mangrove fringes (area adjacent to pneumatophore zone and mudflat) as an ecological habitat for Diapterus auratus juveniles. Sampling was carried out in the rainy (January-July 2016) and dry (August-December 2016) periods. This study indicated that D. auratus juveniles did not show significant differences in abundance and biomass between adjacent habitats. However, univariate analyses found there was a significant increase in fish abundance in the dry season, due to influx of young-of-the-year. Further, the size-frequency of D. auratus showed a recruitment pattern recorded between August and January, suggesting a broad spawning period between the end of the rainy season and a recovery period between March and May. There were distinct changes in the diet between seasons for D. auratus, according to the dendrogram of the food eaten by the fish. The combined results from the distribution and feeding ecology suggest a connectivity among adjacent areas, and indicate that both habitats provide critical foraging and refuge habitat for D. auratus in this tropical estuary.

AB The impact of invasion by a single non-native species on the function and structure of ecological communities can be significant, and the effects can become more drastic-and harder to predict-when multiple species invade as a group. Here we modify a dynamic Boolean model of plant-pollinator community assembly to consider the invasion of native communities by multiple invasive species that are selected either randomly or such that the invaders constitute a stable community. We show that, compared to random invasion, whole community invasion leads to final stable communities (where the initial process of species turnover has given way to a static or near-static set of species in the community) including both native and non-native species that are larger, more likely to retain native species, and which experience smaller changes to the topological measures of nestedness and connectance. We consider the relationship between the prevalence of mutualistic interactions among native and invasive species in the final stable communities and demonstrate that mutualistic interactions may act as a buffer against significant disruptions to the native community.
   Author summary The interactions between species in an ecological community can be significantly perturbed by the introduction of new (i.e., invasive) species. The impact of species introductions can be very challenging to predict, making it difficult to manage or prevent undesirable consequences (e.g., decreased crop pollination). In this report we simulate community invasion by sets of plant and pollinator species that either do or do not represent a stable community to generate predictions about the impacts on interactions in a native community. We find important differences in outcomes including, for instance, that merging two stable communities is less detrimental to the native community than the introduction of an equal number of random invasive species.

AB The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is a group of complex and dynamic microorganisms present in the GI tract of an organism that live in symbiosis with the host and benefit the host with various biological functions. The communities of GI microbiota are formed by various aerobic, anaerobic, and facultatively anaerobic bacteria in aquatic species. In spiny lobsters, common GI microorganisms found in the GI tract are Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Flavobacterium, where the structure and abundance of these microbes are varied depending on the environment. GI microbiotas hold an important role and significantly affect the overall condition of spiny lobsters, such as secreting digestive enzymes (lipase, protease, and cellulase), helping in digesting food intake, providing nutrition and synthesising vitamins needed by the host system, and protecting the host against infection from pathogens and diseases by activating an immune mechanism in the GI tract. The microorganisms in the water column, sediment, and diet are primarily responsible for altering, manipulating, and shaping GI microbial structures and communities. This review also highlights the possibilities of isolating the indigenous GI microbiota as a potential probiotic strain and introducing it to spiny lobster juveniles and larvae for better health management.

AB African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) are significant ecosystem engineers - having profound effects on the vegetation when at high population densities. To provide a context for modern conservation decisions it would be useful to know the 'natural' population densities prior to the arrival of firearms in Africa. Here, we use botanical and archaeological arguments to suggest a lower density of elephant populations than in some present protected areas over at least the last few millennia, and arguably much longer. This suggests that elephant population densities seen in some protected areas during the second half of the twentieth century are likely higher than those seen in the past and so have the potential to result in significant negative impacts on associated fauna and flora.

AB Biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most critical current environmental problems. Global warming is causing substantial species-range shifts and local extirpations, especially for species with restricted distribution ranges. Studies of impact of the climate change on species ranges and environmental suitability have become a fundamental tool for evaluating conservation strategies. However, one important limitation of these approaches is that only species with an adequate number of spatially distinct occurrence records can be modelled, generally excluding threatened rare species from the analyses, a situation referred to as the 'rare species modelling paradox'. To overcome this limitation, we analysed the effect of climate change on the richness of threatened endemic plants of Argentina employing a macroecological modelling approach, using three different modelling techniques (generalized linear mixed models - GLMM, generalized additive models - GAM, and boosted regression trees - BRT), four general circulation models, two representative CO2 concentration pathways (RCPs), and two time periods (2050 and 2070). We identified grid cells with the greatest decline in numbers of threatened endemics, determined species composition in these cells and characterized their vulnerability using three indices. A loss of species richness is observed in ca 83% of the cells, and both protected areas and hotspots of threatened species show significant decrease in future species richness. We identified 32 most affected cells under future climatic projections, including a total of 370 threatened endemic species and exhibiting high beta diversity values (high dissimilarity) among most of the cells. Cells with the highest vulnerability were located along the Central Andes of northwestern Argentina, along the Southern Andean Yungas, High Monte and Central Andean Puna ecoregions, and including a total of 118 threatened endemics (15% of those registered for Argentina) with greater representation of Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, Cactaceae and Iridaceae. However, coverage of protected area network is less than 5% for each of these cells. Our results highlight the urgent need for both in situ and ex situ conservation policies and strategies for the vascular flora of Argentina.

AB Siphonophores (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) are abundant and diverse gelatinous predators in open-ocean ecosystems. Due to limited access to the midwater, little is known about the diets of most deep-dwelling gelatinous species, which constrains our understanding of food-web structure and nutrient flow in these vast ecosystems. Visual gut-content methods can rarely identify soft-bodied rapidly-digested prey, while observations from submersibles often overlook small prey items. These methods have been differentially applied to shallow and deep siphonophore taxa, confounding habitat and methodological biases. DNA metabarcoding can be used to assess both shallow and deep species' diets under a common methodological framework, since it can detect both small and gelatinous prey. We (1) further characterized the diets of open-ocean siphonophores using DNA metabarcoding, (2) compared the prey detected by visual and molecular methods to evaluate their technical biases, and (3) evaluated tentacle-based predictions of diet. To do this, we performed DNA metabarcoding analyses on the gut contents of 39 siphonophore species across depths to describe their diets, using six barcode regions along the 18S gene. Taxonomic identifications were assigned using public databases combined with local zooplankton sequences. We identified 55 unique prey items, including crustaceans, gelatinous animals, and fish across 47 siphonophore specimens in 24 species. We reported 29 novel predator-prey interactions, among them the first insights into the diets of nine siphonophore species, many of which were congruent with the dietary predictions based on tentilla morphology. Our analyses detected both small and gelatinous prey taxa underrepresented by visual methods in species from both shallow and deep habitats, indicating that siphonophores play similar trophic roles across depth habitats. We also reveal hidden links between siphonophores and filter-feeders near the base of the food web. This study expands our understanding of the ecological roles of siphonophores in the open ocean, their trophic roles within the 'jelly-web', and the importance of their diversity for nutrient flow and ecosystem functioning. Understanding these inconspicuous yet ubiquitous predator-prey interactions is critical to predict the impacts of climate change, overfishing, and conservation policies on oceanic ecosystems.

AB Natural regeneration potential is an important indicator for any forest ecosystem and Andaman Padauk (Pterocarpus dalbergioides) is the principal timber tree endemic to Andaman & Nicobar Islands. This study analyzed the natural regeneration potential of Andaman Padauk under different disturbance regimes across its distribution range with regard to population dynamics, growth pattern, population structure, population status and allometry. Contrary to the perception that it is a poor regenerator, the species showed a luxuriant growth. While ephemerals, seedlings, saplings, poles and total regenerates are significantly high at the leading edge of its habitat, trees are significantly high at the trailing edge. Their heights are mostly positively skewed and normally distributed. With a reverse-J shaped demography, the species is in its most dominant form in the stand. Though its population status is declining, the prospects of population stabilization are high. There exists a strong proportionality between DBH and height of regenerates. Hence, the species should be assisted through considered disturbance to realize its natural regeneration potential. As all the species under the pantropical Pterocarpus genus share a number of growth and reproductive traits, the path breaking findings of this study emanated from refined methodologies will help assess the natural regeneration potential of other species whose existence is threatened by either unstable or declining population in their habitat.

AB Road verges can provide important habitats for plants, especially in transformed landscapes. However, roads and their associated traffic have several adverse impacts on ecosystems that can disrupt vital ecological processes, including pollination. In transformed landscapes, the negative effects of roads on pollination might be complemented by impacts of large-scale habitat modification. In these landscapes, road verge populations of plants that rely on pollinators could thus be at risk of pollination failure. This study investigates the pollination of a reseeding, bird-pollinated shrub, Erica glandulosa, in road verges of a fragmented and transformed rural landscape in the southeastern Cape Floristic Region. We test for road impacts on pollination by comparing number of ruptured anther rings - a proxy for pollination - in fynbos vegetation fragments at different distances from the road (0-10, 20-30 and 40-50 m). We also test whether different land-cover types (intact fynbos, alien thickets and rangelands/pastures) next to road verges influence the number of ruptured anther rings. After controlling for robbing rate and plant density, fewer flowers were pollinated near the road (0-10 m) than farther away (beyond 20 m), and fewer flowers were pollinated where road verges occurred next to alien thickets or pastures/rangelands compared to intact fynbos. However, bird pollinators were not excluded in road verges: on average, ca. 20-30% of flowers occurring within 10 m of the road were still visited by birds. While we expect the reduced pollination rate to have a negative effect on the fecundity of road-verge plants, it remains to be tested whether the pollination rate observed in verges is sufficient to sustain populations of bird-pollinated, seed-dependent plants.

AB Questions Non-native tree species (NNT) may bring about economic benefits, but also threats to ecosystems, mostly if they show expansive trends. Location A set of 12,000 permanent plots of the second (1986-1996), third (1997-2007) and fourth (2008-2017) Spanish Forest Inventory. Methods We quantified changes over time (1986-2017) of the NNT present in forests of peninsular Spain and we assessed how NNT's traits, propagule pressure and human perception of NNT explain changes in distribution and demography of NNT. We quantified changes in four demographic parameters of every NNT: changes in the occupancy of species (number of plots where the species are present), annual changes in tree density and basal area, and tree growth. To explain the observed species trends, we selected functional traits related to the resource acquisition strategy, and key human drivers. Results Most of the NNT expanded their occupancy in the study area and increased their density, basal area, and tree growth through time. Increases in tree density and growth were greater in NNT with greater tolerance for low water potentials, with low specific leaf area, and with high propagule pressure. Increases in basal area were greater with high height of the NNT. Conclusions The overall increase in occupancy suggests that there is room for expansion of NNT in Spain. This knowledge will help to predict the dynamics of NNT already present in Spain and identify risks for forest biodiversity.

AB Microhabitat use by predators can be influenced by prey availability, predator size and risk of cannibalism. The preferred microhabitat for a predator can be for foraging, feeding or as a refuge. In this study in south Texas, Centruroides vittatus (Say, 1821) of all size classes utilized both ground and vegetation microhabitats. There was a high proportion of scorpions with caterpillars in legumes and low proportion of scorpions with any of the prey types on the ground. The median height of scorpions with prey did vary, with scorpions on legumes with caterpillar prey the highest and scorpions on other vegetation with dangerous prey the lowest. Intermediate size scorpions used legumes at a high frequency during January-April, and large scorpions used succulents at very high frequency during September-December. Scorpions climbed higher in blackbrush and other legumes than in other vegetation types. These results suggest that scorpions are actively foraging for caterpillars in legumes, and legumes are a quality microhabitat for foraging. The low proportion of scorpions with prey on the ground suggests that C. vittatus feed on prey on vegetation even if the prey was captured on the ground. A possible advantage for the scorpion to handle and consume prey on vegetation is lower predation risk or interference while feeding. The high use of succulents by the large scorpions cannot be explained by foraging success. A possibility is that succulents are preferred refuges by all C. vittatus but smaller scorpions avoid succulents because of the risk of cannibalism by the larger scorpions.

ID SPATIAL RESILIENCE
AB On 14 March 2020, in the face of the health crisis caused by COVID-19, the Spanish government declared a state of alarm in the whole of Spain, which, in different phases and degrees, entailed the confinement of the population and the suspension of economic activity not considered essential. This decision has been analysed from multiple perspectives, including the territorial one, but perhaps the one that has remained most invisible has been the rural perspective.
   This paper aims to analyse the impact of the pandemic and the first confinement in rural areas, by comparison with urban and semi-urban areas.
   In order to achieve this aim, the results of a survey of 2,920 interviews, carried out throughout Spain in May 2020, will be analysed. As we will see, contrary to what was initially expected, rural areas did not behave significantly differently from urban areas. What the statistical analysis shows is that it is the semi-urban environment that was worst affected by the initial impact of the pandemic.

AB The cities of Rafsanjan and Anar are among the main production areas of pistachio, one of Iran's most important export products. However, these regions have faced severe environmental problems in recent years, including climate change. Subsequently, paying attention to the food security and resilience behavior of pistachio farmers in this region is essential to confront the negative impacts of climate change. Therefore, the present study analyzed the relationship between climate change, resilience behavior, and food security in the rural areas of Rafsanjan and Anar. The data collection tool was a questionnaire constructed from parts of several previous study questionnaires, and its validity and reliability were confirmed. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Unified Theory of Acceptance, and the Use of Technology Theory (UTAUT) were used to set the study's theoretical framework. The statistical population consisted of all rural pistachio producers (27,860 people), of which 588 were selected to participate in the study. Data processing was performed using the AMOSver24 software. The results indicate that the level of food security and resilient behavior of the studied farmers in the face of climate change is moderate. In addition, the results of the structural equations showed that the variable resilience behavior against climate change has a direct relationship with the food security of pistachio farmers in the studied areas (estimate =0.637; R-2 = 0.41). Moreover, the variables of behavioral intention, perceived behavioral control, facilitating conditions, attitude towards resilience behavior, performance expectancy, and subjective norms have the most indirect effect on the food security of pistachio farmers in rural areas of Rafsanjan and Anar, respectively. The research results confirm the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Use of Technology Theory.

AB Angola has a great diversity of species and ecosystems and a high level of endemism. However, knowledge of the native flora remains very incomplete and outdated. Leguminosae is the largest family in the country, including many species which are of local or more regional economic importance. Based on an extensive review of bibliographic sources, natural history collections, and online databases, the checklist of Angolan Leguminosae plants was updated, including data on their native distribution, conservation status, and principal uses. The endemic taxa were the subject of additional investigation, including the main habitat, the number of collections preserved in herbaria, and the locality of the first collection. We identified 953 Leguminosae taxa occurring in Angola, of which 165 are endemic to the country. Among the 180 genera found, Crotalaria (136) and Indigofera (96) have the highest number of taxa. Almost half of the studied species have important applications, mainly in traditional medicine (385), forage (267), timber (188), and food (120). Nevertheless, only 27.7% have been assessed according to the IUCN Red List and 10 species are classified as threatened. Thirty-three endemics are known only from the type specimen, revealing the lack of knowledge on these species and the need for further field research. More than 30 type specimens were collected in the Serra da Chela, which highlights the importance of this region for biodiversity conservation.

AB Tree architectures reflect the main abiotic and biotic selection pressures determining tree growth and survival. Studies have shown that trees growing in herbivore-dominated ecosystems, such as savannas, develop denser, more divaricate 'cage'-like architectures in response to chronic browsing pressure (also known as 'brown world' architectures). In contrast, trees growing under resource-limited conditions develop traits that allow them to better compete for abiotic resources (referred to as 'green world' architectures); for example, light limitation can induce trees to form more pole-like structures that allow them to grow faster in height. In temperate forests, abiotic drivers have traditionally been assumed to be the main factors affecting plant architecture. However, gap dynamics typically characterize old-growth temperate forests, where disturbances such as storms create gaps with temporary high-light availability, but also attracting intense mammalian browsing. Under such conditions, one would expect tree saplings to exhibit high architectural plasticity enabling them to develop a 'cage' in response to high herbivore pressure, but when herbivore pressure declines switch to a more pole-like structure that allows them to grow quickly in height and compete for light. We tested the ability of five dominant European tree species to induce a 'cage' architecture (hereafter referred to as 'cage plasticity') under contrasting light and herbivory regimes in a full-factorial experiment in Bialowieza Forest. We planted 720 young tree saplings in six replicated blocks in which we manipulated ungulate browsing (exclosure vs. control) and light levels (gap vs. closed forest). Two out of the five species (hornbeam Carpinus betulus and lime Tilia cordata) were able to develop a cage when exposed to ungulate herbivores but only under high-light conditions. These two species had the highest survival rates in the herbivory treatment over a 10-year period. Synthesis. Cage plasticity in temperate forest tree species may reflect an overlooked adaptation to mammal herbivory originating in a past when large mammals exerted strong selection pressures in European ecosystems. Our findings challenge the view of closed-canopy forest communities being solely driven by abiotic drivers and call for a re-evaluation of the importance of large herbivores in shaping the functional traits of temperate tree species.

AB Increased human-wildlife conflicts in shared and partially closed conservation areas encompassing terrestrial and aquatic systems such as Ngezi Dam in Zimbabwe may arise from competing uses. This case study aimed to (i) estimate the abundance and distribution of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), (ii) identify potential human-crocodile conflict hotspots, (iii) assess the perceptions and attitudes of Ngezi Dam side communities towards crocodiles and their effects on rural livelihoods and (iv) examine the application of co-existence and adaptive co-management concepts in human-crocodile conflict resolution. A mixed-methods research approach integrating field surveys, focus group discussions and face-to-face interviews was used to collect data on crocodiles and human communities. A total of 54 and 57 Nile crocodiles were observed in 2017 and 2018, respectively, with no significant spatiotemporal differences (p > 0.05) in crocodile abundances. Crocodile hotspots (Getis-Ord >1.96) detected round the dam indicated potential human-crocodile-livestock conflicts. Most respondents (76%) showed a negative attitude towards crocodiles, which they indicated destroy livelihoods through injury, death and livestock depredation. The lopsided losses, for example human injuries and fatalities, loss of fishing equipment and livestock in human-crocodile conflicts drawn from this case study reflected a need to delicately recalibrate the contextualised optimisation and balanced implementation of conservation, co-management and human needs in shared landscapes. Astute crocodile conservation whilst offsetting human needs requires an inductive rather than deductive perspective lens. We propose a human-crocodile conflict contextual resolution framework (HCCCR), which prioritises interactive adaptive co-management in a specific context in shared conservation landscapes.

AB Tree pests affect millions of hectares of natural and managed land annually, but we often lack a strong understanding of the factors limiting pest distributions and the drivers that facilitate the expansion of pests outside their hosts' native ranges. Here, we use hierarchical Bayesian regression models to identify the key determinants of pest distributions from a global dataset of >310,000 pest presences/absences across 206 countries and an additional >120,000 pest occurrences outside the native host ranges to validate the model. Our results show there are strong, generalizable controls on pest ranges, including effects of host richness and phylogeny, geography, and climate. Remarkably, our model fit to pest distributions in native host ranges was able to predict pest presences outside the host native range with similar to 79% accuracy. Our work has important implications for predicting regions that may be vulnerable to future pest invasions and understanding the accumulation of pests outside the native ranges of their hosts.

AB While scientific information on spatial variation of freshwater zooplankton is relevant to limnological studies, little information is available from the Ethiopian Rift Valley lake: Lake Hawassa. This study aimed at understanding the spatial distribution of the dominant zooplankton taxa in Lake Hawassa, Ethiopia. Collection of samples and in situ measurements of physico-chemical parameters were carried out at four sites for five consecutive months from April to August in 2019. Twenty-two species of zooplankton were identified. Among these, rotifers were the most important with regard to both species richness and abundance. Copepods were the second most important group in terms of species richness and abundance, whereas cladocerans were the least abundant taxa. All zooplankton groups were very rare at the inlet of the Tikur Wuha River, which could be mainly due to stress, associated with extreme turbidity. Rotifers were predominant at the inlet of influents from referral hospital revealing their adaptation to less clear water and pollution. Copepods attained their highest abundance at the macrophyte zone indicating their preference for water with high clarity and refuge. We concluded that the spatial variation of the zooplankton density in relation to water quality parameters has implications for the applicability of zooplankton as a cost-effective water quality assessment tool in lakes.

AB The spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in a communal grazing system provides pastoralists with a range of grazing sites to select for their livestock. When fencing spatially constrains herds, there is reduced access to ecological heterogeneity, which may have a negative impact on livestock and the grazing resource. This study investigated temporal and spatial changes in stocking densities and distribution within the six major vegetation types of the Leliefontein pastoral area in Namaqualand, South Africa. This semi-arid, biodiverse area of about 2000 km(2) supports a spatially-constrained mobile pastoral system based on small stock production. Over the data period from 1999 to 2006, the location of 256 small stock herds, their temporal occupancy and herd size were used to determine stocking densities within the daily grazing radius of herds. These grazing radii were overlaid using GIS to produce stocking density distributions over the landscape. The density and location of herds were unevenly distributed when assessed monthly and annually. Parts of the study area were consistently overstocked whereas others remained ungrazed. We argue that the recommendation of fixed stocking rates within this variable environment is inappropriate because forage availability and quality fluctuate within and between years and within drought cycles. We conclude that development interventions should rather focus on reducing stocking densities during and after drought periods. This would benefit pastoralists through reduced livestock mortalities and the vegetation would recover more quickly from the impacts of drought.

AB Although density-dependent processes and their impacts on population dynamics are key issues in ecology and conservation biology, empirical evidence of density-dependence remains scarce for species or populations with low densities, scattered distributions, and especially for managed populations where densities may vary as a result of extrinsic factors (such as harvesting or releases). Here, we explore the presence of density-dependent processes in a reinforced population of North African Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata). We investigated the relationship between reproductive success and local density, and the possible variation of this relationship according to habitat suitability using three independent datasets. Based on eight years of nests monitoring (more than 7000 nests), we modeled the Daily Nest Survival Rate (DNSR) as a proxy of reproductive success. Our results indicate that DNSR was negatively impacted by local densities and that this relationship was approximately constant in space and time: (1) although DNSR strongly decreased over the breeding season, the negative relationship between DNSR and density remained constant over the breeding season; (2) this density-dependent relationship did not vary with the quality of the habitat associated with the nest location. Previous studies have shown that the demographic parameters and population dynamics of the reinforced North African Houbara bustard are strongly influenced by extrinsic environmental and management parameters. Our study further indicates the existence of density-dependent regulation in a low-density, managed population.

AB Brazil has a coast that is threatened by economic activities and accelerated urbanisation process, causing ecosystem unbalance and decreasing socioenvironmental quality. We analysed data collected from 2010 to 2019 during the Beach Monitoring Project in north-eastern Brazil to quantify sea turtle strandings with signs of anthropogenic interaction, verify the impact of economic activities on the strandings, and analyse a possible relation between socioeconomic conditions and the strandings. Anthropogenic interaction was classified into 12 categories (eight related to fishing activities). We analysed 6007 strandings, including four sea turtle species and anthropogenic interaction was observed in 12.88% (n = 774) of the strandings. Chelonia mydas represented 94.05% of the total records with anthropogenic interaction and fishing-related strandings accounted for 81.65%. Juvenile individuals were more affected than adults; likewise, females were more affected than males. Icapui and Areia Branca are very populous municipalities, and showed large number of strandings with signs of anthropogenic interaction. Our analyses revealed that fishing-related strandings were reported throughout the year; however, a larger number of records occurred in the dry season and during the lobster-fishing season. Our study brings knowledge on sea turtle strandings in north-eastern Brazil, providing results that support public policies to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on sea turtles.

AB Identifying the trophic attributes of cooccurring invaders is a prerequisite to anticipate and mitigate their simultaneous impacts. We used an allometric niche model (aNM) to infer the trophic attributes of a mysid (Hemimysis anomala) and a catfish (Silurus glanis) that recently colonized the largest natural lake in France (Lake Bourget) and we raised the potential consequences of this multispecies invasion on this ecosystem following changes in trophic links in the invaded food web. H. anomala was predicted to mainly rely on primary producers, while S. glanis was expected to experience an ontogenetic change in its trophic attributes (i.e., a diet shift from invertebrate to fish at similar to 90 cm and no more predators at similar to 60 cm). At the whole-lake scale, both invaders would have additive impacts, by competing for resources (diet overlap) with a set of resident species and increasing the trophic vulnerability of fish, invertebrates and primary producers. The trophic link changes caused by the current S. glanis population (i.e., mainly composed of 40-60 cm individuals) and a "future" population (i.e., higher proportion of > 100 cm individuals) suggested an increasing predation pressure on resident fish. In both scenarios, both invaders were also highlighted to be putative prey for resident species, especially H. anomala. The aNM represents a flexible tool for biological invasion management, taking advantage of widely available monitoring data, to identify vulnerable resident species and implement early management actions (e.g. size-based functional controls) when empirical data on invaders are sparse, particularly in the early phases of their colonization.

AB The global trade in wildlife affects similar to 24% of terrestrial vertebrates, and demand for traditional Chinese medicinal materials, is a high profile driver. Among key hopes for reducing the impacts of "TCM" on wildlife are strategies to redirect demand onto plant-origin alternative medicines. Studies demonstrate substantial support such alternatives among regular consumers of TCM, but it remains unknown whether TCM doctors would be willing to prescribe these to their patients. We conducted online questionnaires with 1000 doctors in the People's Republic of China (PRC) who are registered with Chunyu Yisheng Doctor, the largest online provider of healthcare in the PRC. We asked four principal questions: (1) To what extent medical professionals in the PRC felt animal-origin medicinal materials could be replaced with plant-origin alternatives; (2) Whether plant-origin alternatives for specific animal-origin medicinal materials were deemed effective and acceptable by the practitioners; (3) What considerations might influence doctors' decisions concerning whether to prescribe plant-origin alternatives, and; (4) To what degree doctors' attitudes were influenced by patients' attitudes. We found substantial support for the substitution of plant-origin TCM medicinal materials: 86.4% of respondents stated that they were "willing" or "very willing" to do so. This proportion increased with the number of years respondents had been practising. Similarly, 66.8% of responses were in favour of prescribing plant-origin preparations if the animal-origin original was unavailable, with 54.7% in favour even if the original animal-origin preparation was available. Respondents were approximately twice as likely to select a higher probability of prescribing plant-origin alternatives when shown information stating that 92% of frequent TCM users would be likely or very likely to buy plant-origin TCM preparations. TCM doctors' principal concerns regarding plant-origin alternatives were the medicines' effectiveness, safety and financial cost to patients; and those who made a comparison indicated that they believed plant-origin medicines to be as effective, safer and less expensive (therefore more attractive) to patients than animal-origin medicines. We conclude that Chinese medical professionals who incorporate TCM into their daily practise would be likely to support initiatives to replace certain animal-origin medicinal materials with plant-origin alternatives.

ID TRADE
AB The use of plants and animals for traditional medicines is a high-profile driver of the global trade in wildlife (Baker et al. 2013). Among traditional medicines, the sourcing of wildlife-origin medicinal materials for Traditional Chinese Medicine ("TCM") gives rise to an international trade that can negatively impact upon a substantial diversity of animal species. A growing body of work highlights that both consumers and practitioners of "TCM" would be prepared to accept medicines made with plant-origin substitute ingredients in place of wildlife-origin medicines, but a potential barrier to the wider uptake of plant-origin alternatives is the extent to which their suitability has been researched and tested. The extent to which research into substitutes for wild animal-origin medicines by TCM scholars in the Chinese traditional medicinal scientific literature has considered plant-origin materials is unknown. We performed a non-exhaustive literature review to provide an indication of this extent. The literature search located 17 published manuscripts which detailed 38 substitute medicinal materials for nine threatened animal species. All of the substitutes for wildlife-origin medicinal materials were of animal origin, except for three synthetic alternatives, and one plant-origin substitute. While our literature search was not intended to be exhaustive, the sample of papers derived indicate that current scholarship in China, regarding substitutes for wildlife-origin medicinal materials in "TCM", is currently targeted towards the investigation of animal-origin substitute materials, rather than of plant-origin substitute materials.

AB The Mediterranean Basin has distinct vegetation types shaped by fire, herbivory, and various human activities. Based on data from 83 belt transects of 10 x 40 m in 28 study sites for five physiognomic vegetation types (semi-closed forest, open forest, closed shrubland, open shrubland, and scrubland) in southwestern Anatolia (Turkey), we analyzed woody species diversity, woody community composition, and vegetation structure of study sites. We used the growth form and regeneration strategy for functional comparisons of physiognomic vegetation types. We found clear distinctions in diversity, species composition, and functional structure of woody plant community across five physiognomic vegetation types. The forest-shrubland-scrubland distinction was the most apparent one. Despite similarities in the woody species richness and Shannon diversity, open and closed vegetation states of forests and shrublands also differed regarding the density and cover of mature individuals and the density of saplings in different functional groups. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses and indicator species analyses also indicated clear distinctions among physiognomic vegetation types and openness states. Our findings indicate the necessity of a more complex description of vegetation types in the Mediterranean Basin. The results suggest that open and closed vegetation states of forests and shrublands are functionally distinct vegetation types.

AB The Atlantic Islands of Galicia Maritime/Terrestrial National Park hosts one of the largest breeding colonies of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) in the world. In 2002, a new yellow-legged gull breeding colony was established on the Punta Muxieiro dune complex, which also harbors rare and threatened plant species and habitat types of community interest according to Directive 92/43/EEC. This study assesses the effect of this colony on two habitats of community interest: white dunes and grey dunes. For this purpose, plant cover and soil properties, composition, and nutrient content were monitored in plots with different gull densities. Moreover, historic aerial images were compiled to observe changes in the plant landscape of the dune system. The results showed that, despite the recentness of the occupation of the dune system by yellow-legged gull species, significant changes in acidic-alkaline processes and nutrient availability were already observed in soils. Soils in plots with higher gull density showed more acidic pH values and a higher content of the most labile N and P fractions. Moreover, a decrease in plant cover and number of species was also demonstrated in plots with higher gull densities. Finally, the presence of ruderal and alien species such as Urtica membranacea and Parietaria judaica was also observed.

AB In addition to unpredictable natural ephemeral wetlands (e.g., temporal pools after rainfall), artificial environments such as subdivided rice paddies in Japan are challenging environments regarding organism adaptation because of remarkable spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Because different paddies are managed by different farmers, the timing, duration of irrigation, and application of agrochemicals are largely different among neighboring paddies. I investigated the occurrence, adult body size, and female fecundity of the fairy shrimp Branchinella kugenumaensis in a terraced rice field (31 selected from approximately 100 paddies in a valley approximately 1200 m in length) in Kyoto, Japan. The duration of inundation varied from 47 to 86 days, which was sufficiently long for the sexual maturation of the shrimp. At most stations, shrimps repeated oviposition during an approximately 20-day adult lifespan with adult growth. At a few stations with the longest inundation, located in the uppermost part of the river, the shrimps continued adult growth and reproduction for approximately 40 days (long-reproducing type [LR]). At a few stations with the shortest inundation, located at the mouth of the valley, the shrimps seldom showed adult growth, and the second generation occurred after drainage and reirrigation (short-reproducing type [SR]). In the early days of adulthood, the SR females produced significantly more eggs than the LR females of the same body length, but the LR females achieved maximal body size and fecundity at the end. The SR may perform conservative bet-hedging (early reproduction in small size), but the LR could be results of genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity.

AB Herbivore digestion in aquatic ecosystems is usually considered a method of nutrient repackaging rather than recycling, as recalcitrant and low-level nutrients are presumed for their egesta. We hypothesize that this opinion holds only for nutrients recycled by excretion and egestion, not for those elements recycled overwhelmingly by fecal decomposition. In this study, we compared the dissolution of biogenic silica (BSi), phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) between two food items and fecal pellets of two marine invertebrates fed on artificial seawaters free of bacteria. Relative to raw food materials, the mass proportion in fecal pellets of BSi increased, while that of P and Fe decreased. During the 21 days of incubation, the total dissolution rate of BSi was 13.9-36.0 times higher in fecal pellets than food items, followed by P (1.5-4.2 times) and Fe (1.1-2.4 times). While the dissolution of BSi and Fe occurred mostly in the first few days, P was mostly released in the last ten days. Regarding BSi dissolution, a higher rate was observed in oyster Crassostrea gigas than the Echiuran Urechis unicinctus, but no significant difference was found between fecal pellets in either species under naturally available diatom food (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and introduced terrestrial food (rice husk powder), respectively. Our results show direct evidence of digestion-associated nutrients mobilization. BSi dissolution after animal digestion may be similarly efficient to that caused by bacteria colonization in natural seawater.

AB The ability of corals to modulate their nutrition strategy in response to variable nutrient supply remains poorly understood, limiting our understanding of energy flow in coral reef ecosystems and thus our comprehension of their resilience to global changes. We used a naturally occurring nutrient gradient along the reef flat of two seabird-inhabited islets in the SW Pacific to characterize spatiotemporal fluctuations in coastal nutrient availability, and how it modulates the trophic response of the mixotrophic coral Pocillopora damicornis. The clear gradients in dissolved [NOx] and delta N-15 values of macroalgae and both P. damicornis tissues and symbionts observed along the reef flat during the dry and the rainy season revealed that seabird-derived-N is supplied year-round to the reef flat. Yet, nitrogen isotope values of macroalgae show that the seabirds' effect on coral reefs varies with sites and seasons. Metrics derived from the SIBER framework revealed that coral nutrition seasonally favored autotrophy when exposed to higher seabird guano concentrations and at inshore stations, while heterotrophy dominated in corals less exposed to seabird-derived nutrient supply. P. Damicornis is therefore able to cope with large changes in nitrogen supply induced by seabird island communities by switching between autotrophy and heterotrophy. These results shed light on the flexibility of resource sharing within the coral-algae symbiosis and highlight the importance of seabird populations to the functioning of coral reef ecosystems.

AB Seasonality in the Cerrado biome of Brazil is characterized by a dry season and a rainy season, affecting the availability of water and generating nutritional limitations. Thus, plants and animals have developed adaptive mechanisms in order to survive in this environment. Insects known as antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) occur in areas of the Cerrado and build traps in dry soil to capture prey items. In the rainy season, these insects are unable to forage due to the waterlogged soil. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the rainfall regime in the Cerrado on aspects of trap-building behavior, larval development and morphological characteristics of adult antlions. Larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon brasiliensis (Navas, 1914) were observed and collected in an area of the Cerrado biome in the municipality of Aquidauana (MS), Brazil. Observations were performed in the rainy and dry seasons to determine the abundance of traps built by M. brasiliensis larvae. In the laboratory, experiments were performed involving the manipulation of the frequency of simulated rain on the traps. The results revealed that variations in rainfall due to seasonality in the Cerrado affect M. brasiliensis larvae, with greater foraging observed in the dry season. The laboratory experiments demonstrated that differences in the frequency of rains affect the mortality of the larvae, larval development time and the size of the adults. Thus, variations in rainfall patterns can lead to variations in the characteristics of the population structure of M. brasiliensis in areas of the Cerrado biome in Brazil.

AB In this study, through a rapid assessment, we evaluated differences in richness, abundance, species composition and beta diversity of Euglossini bees in preserved areas and areas altered by riverine human populations in the Caxiuana National Forest (northern Amazon). Our hypotheses were: i) the species richness, diversity, abundance and composition of Euglossini bees differ between the preserved and altered areas because many species are intolerant to small anthropic disturbances; and ii) areas altered by riverine populations have higher values of beta diversity (species dissimilarity between sites) than preserved areas, due to local changes in habitat and increased heterogeneity between sites. We sampled two areas (preserved and altered) and, in each area, four transects were sampled with odorous baits. We used a Student's t test to evaluate differences in richness, abundance, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index. We also evaluated differences in composition and differences in beta diversity between areas. We collected 102 specimens, identified in 18 species and three genera, 63 individuals (61.8% of the total) in preserved areas and 39 individuals (38.2%) in altered areas. Euglossa liopoda (Dressler, 1982) was the most abundant in altered areas and Euglossa imperialis (Cockerell, 1922) the most abundant in preserved areas. Species richness was 2.5 times greater in the transects of preserved areas, and species composition also differed between the sampled areas. In contrast, species abundance did not differ between transects of both areas. Despite our small sample size, this study demonstrated that the richness, composition and beta diversity of Euglossini bees can be potentially affected by local changes in habitat caused by small-scale activities provided by traditional Amazonian groups. Our results indicate the urgency for more comprehensive studies aimed to investigate these relationships.

AB Seawater parameters are important indicators of coastal water conditions. One of the essential parameters is the total suspended solids (TSS). This study probed how to use a low-cost 535-nm green LED to measure the TSS in marine protected areas of barangay Lo-ong, Concepcion, Iloilo, Philippines. It aims to examine the relationship of the total attenuation coefficients (TAC) to total suspended solids (TSS) values in coastal water. Sample sea waters were taken from various locations and brought to a laboratory for a filtration process known as gravimetry. Different available filter paper sizes (1.5 microns, 6 microns, 20 microns, and 50 microns) were used in the filtration process and were dried in a controlled constant temperature of 110 degrees Celsius for 24 hours using an electric oven. Dried filter papers' weights were measured using an analytical balance before using the infiltration of seawater. TAC values were also measured in different seawater samples using a prototype device made up of LED and photodiode. This study demonstrated that TAC values of green LEDs are positively correlated with TSS values (R value of 0.45). Results reveal that the moderate correlation between an LED's TAC values to TSS positively proved that a low-cost LED can be used as an alternative to the more expensive remote sensing satellite data. Findings of the study also showed that TSS values in the marine protected area under study were far below the acceptable limits for coastal waters. The performance of the LED-based measuring device can still be improved in the future by using collimating lenses and more sensitive photomultiplier tubes.

AB The article describes the approaches and features of classification of forests, habitats and vegetation at the Pan-European level on the example of the classification of European forest types (EFT), the EUNIS habitat classification and the Europe vegetation classification created by the phytosociologists of the European Vegetation Survey (EVS). The forest type in the EFT classification is a large forest vegetation unit distinguished within biogeographic regions by the similarity of forest site conditions, structure and productivity of the plantation, and the degree of anthropogenic transformation of forests. Accounting for the successional dynamics of forest biogeocoenosis is worked out at the theoretical level, in practice, the accounting is possible due to the information obtained from the EUNIS habitat classification, which is linked to the EVS classification by cross-references. The EUNIS classification is a Pan-European reference set of habitat units. It was created using the results of previous large-scale studies in Europe, which resulted in the creation of a number of classifications of biotopes, soil cover and marine habitats. The EVS classification is a comprehensive hierarchical syntaxonomic system of unions, orders and classes of Brown-Blanquet syntaxonomy for vascular plants, mosses, lichens and algae native to Europe. The great advantage of the EFT classification is the inclusion of anthropogenic impacts among the key diagnostic features of a forest type, which are defined by assessing the degree of naturalness of forests, the number of forest species, the type and intensity of anthropogenic impacts. The strength of the EFT classification is to establish cross-links with other forest type classification systems used both within national forest inventory systems and at the EU level. The use of the Braun-Blanquet ecological and floristic approach implemented in the classification of phytosociological alliances makes it possible to conduct a detailed ecological analysis and taking into account not only the stand productivity, but also the level of stand biodiversity, which makes the classification more useful for scientific research and nature preservation.

AB Introduction: "Ant gardens" are ant nests located at different heights on trees on which vascular epiphytic plants that have been transported and sown by ants have germinated. Although this mutualistic relationship has been studied in humid tropical ecosystems, information on other tropical and Colombian ecosystems is scarce.
   Objective: To characterize the distribution, building, diversity, demography and phenology of ant gardens in dry tropical forest.
   Methods: In January and February, 2018, we identified 170 ant gardens on a 100x5 m transect on the banks of the Quesada River, Colombia, and in adjacent secondary dry premontane transitional forest; we monitored changes, for gardens and plants, in 28 of them, every two weeks (March 2018-February 2019).
   Results: The gardens, built by Azteca ulei, were aggregated near water bodies; had 10 species of epiphytes and were on 13 tree species. Larger gardens had more epiphyte species. Some epiphytes had a bimodal phenological pattern. Less seedlings become established in the dry season, and less adults remain in the gardens. Garden characteristics benefit both epiphytes and ants.
   Conclusions: The gardens built by A. ulei have ecological characteristics that favor the germination, establishment, and reproduction of diverse epiphytes in this dry tropical ecosystem, including aggregation near water flows.

All changes in the taxon listing from the 2012 version are documented and explained in an appendix. Based on comprehensive data sources, including the recently developed Pladias Database of the Czech Flora and Vegetation and the Archaeobotanical Database of the Czech Republic, we list 1576 taxa alien to this country, with information on their taxonomic position, life form, geographic origin, residence time category (archaeophyte or neophyte), invasion status (casual, naturalized or invasive), date of the first and last field record, grid-cell occupancy, pathway of introduction into the country, habitat affiliation and impact assessment. This edition includes 122 more taxa than the 2012 edition; 157 taxa were added and 35 were removed. Of the removed taxa, 17 were reclassified as native, eight were removed due to lack of evidence of the occurrence in the wild, records of six taxa were assessed as doubtful, and four are not taxonomically justified. The alien flora is recruited from 630 genera and 122 families, and comprises 385 archaeophytes and 1191 neophytes; most taxa are casual (1084, i.e. 68.8% of the total number), 417 taxa are naturalized (26.4%), and 75 are invasive (4.8%). The proportion of invasive taxa is almost equal for archaeophytes and neophytes (4.7% and 4.8%, respectively), casual taxa are over-represented among neophytes, and naturalized taxa among archaeophytes. The contribution of alien taxa to the Czech flora is 37.8% if all aliens are considered or 16.2% if only naturalized taxa (including invasives), which are a permanent part of the flora, are included. For all groups of invasion status, the numbers of taxa are increasing over time with no sign of deceleration. Most alien plants originate from the Mediterranean region (618 taxa, i.e. 31.5%), other parts of Europe (380 taxa, 19.4%), other parts of Asia (290 taxa, 14.1%) and North America (262 taxa, 13.4%). The highest number of invasive taxa (27, corresponding to 27.6% of all invasive archaeophytes and neophytes) are from North America. Occupancy of grid cells of 10 x 6 arc-minutes significantly increases with invasion status and residence time. Invasive taxa are present in more grid cells than naturalized and casual, and archaeophytes occupy on average more grid cells than neophytes in each invasion status category. Maps based on the cumulative record of alien species occurrence over the past 50 years, expressed as the proportion of the entire flora, show that alien species are relatively more prevalent in lowlands and large urban agglomerations. In a European comparison, the Czech Republic is currently a moderately invaded country.

AB The expansion process of the Iberian ibex in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, Madrid (Spain). In this paper we explore the usefulness of MaxEnt to predict the most suitable areas for a wildlife species, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica). For two decades (1990-2010), the species was established in a small part of the National Park Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain) and there has been a process of expansion to other areas of this protected area since 2010. However, almost two decades have elapsed since the modeling methods (MaxEnt) were proposed and no studies have tested their effectiveness using real distribution data, i.e. data from past predictions, to see if they fit the current distribution. We generated a model with presen-ce-only data from 2007 and verified accuracy from 2017 data concerning real presence. Our results show a relationship between models and the species' current presence. The generated model can be useful to define the preferred locations of the species. We detected several differences between males and females of the species. This work not only shows the importance of selecting climatic and ecological variables for the construction of models but also indicates that they must be adjusted, at least for some species, to each sex and period of the year.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the effects of four different elevations on Acacia mangium volume in Bintulu, Sarawak. A total of 60 felled trees of A. mangium were used to develop a volume equation by measuring the volume at four different classes of elevation. The study of stand volume estimation in Malaysian plantations, particularly in Bintulu, is sparse. To get the average cross-sectional area, the volume of each tree in each part of the felled trees was estimated using Smalian's and Newton's formulas. Four equations were developed in this study to predict the volume from the diameter and analyze the effect of elevation on tree volume. According to the regression analysis, there was a significant relationship between the volume and diameter for each slope steepness. The Very Slope site had the highest volume with an R-2 value of 0.948 for the model's fit, which revealed that 94.8% of the data could be evaded. Volume estimation using the regression model can be used to determine and categorize according to its class of elevation, and there is an effect of elevation on standing volume. A. mangium has better growth performance in a very slope area in terms of tree volume compared to different elevations.

AB Endemism is one of the most important concepts in biogeography and is often used to guide biodiversity conservation, yet our understanding of the determinants of endemism in many biodiverse tropical regions is limited. This is true for western Central Africa, a region with one of the highest levels of plant diversity in tropical Africa, where endemism is poorly documented. This study examines the Gabonese Area of Endemism (GAE) and explores the main characteristics and determinants of its vascular plant endemism with regard to taxonomy, growth form, habitat, distribution, and range size. We compiled a comprehensive, verified specimen database of vascular plant taxa restricted to the GAE, comprising 19,876 occurrences of 1145 species and infraspecific taxa, and we characterized the habitat and habit for each taxon. We then calculated the proportion of taxa in the regional flora that are endemic to the GAE. A Wileoxon rank-sum test was used to investigate range size among endemic taxa exhibiting different growth forms, and Fisher exact tests were used to explore the association between their habit and habitat, and to test the distribution of these attributes among higher-level taxa and growth forms compared to patterns in the regional flora as a whole. We found that endemic taxa represent ca. 13% of the GAE flora, and that the rate of endemism varies considerably among taxonomic groups and growth forms. Endemism is highest among shrubs (22%) and lowest in herbs (8%), especially monocotyledons (e.g., 5% among Poales). Most endemic iaxa grow preferentially in forest habitats, the dominant vegetation type of the region. Endemic trees, which structure forest ecosystems, have significantly larger ranges than endemic herbs, climbers, and shrubs. About 17% of the flora of Gabon is endemic or subendemic to the country. Our results show that the dispersal capacity of taxa and the biogeographical history of the region appear to be critical factors in explaining differences in the rate of endemism among growth forms and taxonomic groups. Our findings also highlight the benefits of carefully building a comprehensive and verified database for studying rare and range-restricted plants, and they underscore the necessity to strengthen botanical exploration throughout western Central Africa in order to develop improved and better-informed conservation strategies.

AB Peat deposits (>50 ka) in the montane Nilgiris (Western Ghats, India), have been central to the reconstruction of late Quaternary paleoclimate using paleovegetation changes in the forest-grassland vegetation mosaic that coexist here. However, it is well-known that short-term disturbances can also cause vegetation switches when multiple stable vegetation states exist. We studied paleovegetation changes within the alternative stable states framework using stable carbon isotopes (relative abundance of C3-C4 vegetation) on the cellulose fraction from two high-resolution radiocarbon-dated peat cores similar to 170 m apart in the Sandynallah valley: Core 1 closer to the hillslope (32,000 years old) and Core 2 from the centre of the valley (45,000 years old). Core 1 is located in an ecotone showing shola-sedgeland dynamics with vegetation switching at c.22 ka from shola (possibly due to fire) to a prolonged unstable state until 13 ka sustained by low waterlogging. Following a hiatus c.13 ka, sedgeland dominates, with a shift into shola at 3.75 ka driven by increasing aridity. Core 2 shows a stable sedgeland mixed C3-C4 composition responding to temperature, enriched in C3-vegetation in the last glacial with C4dominance beginning c.18.5 ka, indicative of deglacial warming. The distinctive vegetation states at corresponding times in Cores 1 and 2 within the same valley, responding independently to disturbances and climate, respectively, is the first paleo-record from an alternative stable states landscape in the montane tropics. Thus, short-term disturbances and site attributes need to be accounted for before ascribing vegetation change to changing climate in such vegetation mosaics.

AB High bush density and cover have negative effects on the environment in general and on livestock production, in particular in savanna rangelands. The study examined the effects of bush control techniques on woody sapling recruitment in the low land savanna region. The study consisted of 21 plots located next to each other on an area of 5.3 ha encroached by Acacia mellifera and Acacia reficiens trees. Seven bush control treatments were assigned randomly to the plots and replicated three times. In the bush clearing plot, woody species were removed at ground level using a handsaw. In the tree thinning; thinning and grazing; thinning and browsing; thinning and fire, and thinning with fire-browsing treatments, trees were thinned to the equivalents of 60% of the density of that of the control plot. Positive changes in sapling densities were observed in the clearing, thinning, and thinning and grazing treatments. In contrast, the control, thinning and browsing, and thinning and fire treatments presented negative changes in densities. A change in sapling density was highest in the cleared plot, whereas it was lowest in the thinning, fire, and browsing treatment. The correlation between changes in sapling densities and new recruitments was highly (p < 0.001) significant in the clearing, thinning, and thinning and grazing treatments thus increased sapling recruitment with the proportion greater for the clearing treatment. The significant correlation induced average sapling recruitment in the control, and low in the thinning with browsing and thinning with fire treatments. The relationship was insignificant in the thinning, fire, and browsing combination treatment and resulted in the lowest rate of saplings' recruitment. Postthinning techniques reduced woody tree recruitment and would sustain open savanna under the continuous management plan.

   BEHAVIOR
AB There is conflicting research regarding how conspecific plant density can affect pollinator visitation, with some studies indicating dense flower patches will receive more visitors and other studies demonstrating the opposite. This study investigated the effects of conspecific density on pollinator visitation in a restored prairie. Three plant species, Penstemon digitalis (Nutt. ex Sims) (Lamiales: Plantaginaceae), Monarda fistulosa (L.) (Lamiales: Lamiaceae), and Eryngium yuccifolium (Michx.) (Apiales: Apiaceae), were observed, with visiting pollinators recorded. Conspecific density did not have an effect on total pollinator visitation rates for any of the focal plant species. However, different groups of pollinators varied in their responses to flower density, notably with larger Bombus spp. tending to visit dense flowering patches more than did other groups of bees. This suggests that plant density may impact certain pollinators differently than others. These results also indicate a possible mechanism through which multiple pollinator species can coexist while only one flowering resource is available, with the foraging behavior of smaller bees potentially allowing them to avoid competition with larger, social bees. Furthermore, a comparison of seed weight demonstrated that E. yuccifolium plants tended to have larger seed sets in isolated individuals, suggesting that flowers in large patches may be pollinated less effectively and are competing for, rather than facilitating, pollinator visits.

ID DIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; ENDEMISM
AB Bee species from the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOr) were studied to obtain patterns of richness and endemism. We divided the study area into a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude grid where 4,547 records of bees in 279 species, 73 genera, and five families were collected from institutional databases and one museum. The data indicated that species richness was concentrated in the northern portion of the SMOr. The complementary index for each combination of grid-cells resulted in high values (IC > 0.8). Within the SMOr, nine grid-cells (of 21) were enough to represent 82% of the species. The Arteaga grid-cell had the most species richness, and values of endemism indices coincided with two natural protected areas known as Cumbres de Monterrey National Park and Bajo Rio San Juan Protection Resources Area. We concluded that the northern portion of the SMOr is the most biodiverse region of bee species in this mountain chain.

AB Taxol drugs can be extracted from various species of the taxaceae family. It is an alkaloid (metabolic product) used for the treatment of various types of cancer. Since taxol is a metabolic product, multiple aspects such as edaphic, biochemical, topographic factors need to be assessed in determining the variation in Taxol Content (TC). In this study, both sensor-based hyperspectral reflectance data and absorption-based indices were tested together for the development of an advanced statistical unfolding approach to understand the influencing factors for TC in high altitude Himalayan region. Seriation analysis based on permutation matrix was applied with complete linkage and a multi-fragment heuristic scaling rule along with the common techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and correlation to understand the relationship of TC with various factors. This study also tested the newly developed taxol indices to rule out the possibility of overlapping of TC determining bands with the foliar pigment's wavelengths in the visible region. The result implies that T. wallichiana with a high TC is found more in its natural habitat of deep forest, relating it indirectly to elevation in the case of the montane ecosystem. Taxol is the most varying parameter among the measured variables, followed by hyperspectral Taxol content (TC) indices such as TC 2, TC 5, and carotenoids, which suggests that the indices are well versed to capture variations in TC with elevation.

AB Over the past few decades, many research efforts have been dedicated to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate resilience in different domains. As compared with research areas in social science and ecology, the concept of resilience in the engineering domain is relatively new. In the engineering domain, studies on resilience mostly focus on civil infrastructure. It is important to extend the concept of resilience to a broad range of engineering applications. The field environments of complex engineering systems vary with different applications. Even with the same component/system applied in different field environments, the ability, time, and resources required by failure detection, diagnosis, and restoration can be different. Hence, it is critical to introduce a new dimension, random field environment (RFE), into the development of the mathematical model for quantifying resilience. This article first introduces a new definition of resilience and then proposes a general RFE-based multidimensional time-dependent resilience model connecting reliability, vulnerability, and recoverability. Besides, we present a specific RFE-based multidimensional time-dependent resilience model by considering the specified functions of the impact of the RFE on system performance and recovery. Furthermore, we extend the proposed resilience model by incorporating multiple failure paths of complex systems. Finally, we apply the proposed resilience model to vehicular edge computing networks to evaluate the vehicular network resilience with the disruptive events on the communication links.

AB Livestock grazing intensity gradients associated with sheep holder shelters influenced the longevity of rangelands vegetation. This study aimed to examine the effects of livestock grazing pressure on vegetation structure and diversity with distance from herder shelters. Six shelters were sampled. From each herder shelter, a grazing gradient was set aligned to the contour lines. Along each grazing gradient, we surveyed seven 100-m transects between 10 and 800 m from the herder shelter. The standing crop biomass (dry matter = DM) along the gradient from the shelters, bare soil, cover of vegetation functional groups and plant species diversity were determined using the point intercept method along each transect. Bare soil cover increased as we approached herder shelter. The total standing crop biomass (DM) (in g DM m(-2)) increased with the distance from the shelter. Shrub biomass decreased when approaching shelters, as so did the percentage of shrub cover. Cover of perennial forbs and grass also increased with distance from shelter, whereas annual cover increased as we approached the shelter. Species richness and diversity increased when moving away from the shelter. Changes in vegetation structure were not linear. Strong changes were detectable within the first 200 m, whereas little responses were found behind this threshold. The 200 m threshold should be used to monitor the main keystone species that preserved these rangelands.

AB Demand for tiger parts and products has fuelled the poaching of wild tigers. As the supply of wild tigers has become scarce, tiger farming has emerged as an alternative source and proliferated in several Asian countries with unclear implications of a legalized trade in farmed tigers on wild tiger demand. We conducted a choice experiment with 228 Vietnamese tiger bone glue consumers investigating their preferences and trade-offs for different attributes of their purchase choice, including legality, source, purity, and price. We calculated consumers' willingness to pay for each attribute level under the current trade ban and in a hypothetical legal trade. Consumers preferred and were willing to pay more for wild than farmed tiger glue and a higher proportion of tiger bone in the glue. Consumers also preferred legal over illegal sufficiently for most to switch from illegal wild to legal farmed tiger. Hence, a legal trade will shift preferences significantly towards farmed tiger glue from legal sources but will not eradicate demand for wild tigers, likely leading to the parallel operation of legal and illegal markets. We discuss the implications of the results for conserving wild tigers through efforts to manage demand in Vietnam.

AB Following a long-term herbivore-exclusion study (2003-2008) in the mid-eulittoral zone at Kalk Bay, Cape Town, South Africa, the post-herbivore-exclusion effect (12 years later) of the limpet Cymbula oculus, the dominant herbivore in the community, was examined after it had recolonised the area. Despite the limpet having recruited into all plots (previous exclusion plots and control plots), the species richness, percentage cover of sessile organisms, invertebrate densities and invertebrate biomass were all significantly higher in previous exclusion plots compared with in control plots. Cymbula oculus density was higher in previous exclusion plots (11.11 [SD 12.54] ind. m(-2)) than in control plots (9.26 [SD 7.97] ind. m(-2)) (p = 0.038); however, its biomass was similar between the previous exclusion plots and control plots (366.39 [SD 421.63] vs 367.96 [SD 285.44] g m(-2), p = 0.179), indicating that limpets outside exclusion plots were generally larger. This was likely because of younger C. oculus individuals, heightened interspecific competition, or insufficient space in previous exclusion plots. The observed differences might be attributed to a combination of factors, including the persistence of species that have achieved a size refuge from grazing and bulldozing by C. oculus, as well as the establishment of invasive mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis which offer secondary substrates and microhabitats for the establishment of macroalgae and other invertebrates. The recruitment of M. galloprovincialis into the previous exclusion plots is likely to be the cause of the alternative community state observed. Unless some extreme disturbance event occurs, the community from which C. oculus was previously excluded is unlikely to revert to its pre-C. oculus exclusion state.

AB Given the detrimental impact of natural resource degradation on livelihoods and sustainability, this research critically reviews the related studies and the role of policies and community participation toward addressing the issues. It carries out bibliometric analysis of highly cited scientific research publications on natural resource management compiled from the database of Scopus and Web of Science. Here, emphasis is given on reviewing the intersections between natural resource management and the underlying challenges in policies and community participation. In addition, it also analyzes the synergies of policies and institutions with decentralization of power for resource conservation and management. The article proposes a bottom-up approach to policy making and decentralized framework based on community participation and ownership rights for resource management. Engagement with local community and bringing in their behavioral changes would be crucial for efficient integrated natural resource management.

AB Background: Pneumonia due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly all over the world and air travel is the leading transmission route of the virus among countries. The aim of the study is to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in aircrew, to determine occupa-tional exposure, and to understand the spread of immunity in social groups. Method: The study was designed as a cross-sectional retrospective study. SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured in patients who applied to between December 1, 2020 and January 13, 2021. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity was investigated before December 1, 2020. Results: The patients were divided into three groups according to their jobs such as 313 aircrew; 451 healthcare workers; 4258 other patients. The PCR positivity rate was found to be 39% in the aircrew group, 32% in the healthcare workers and %20 other patient group (p < 0.001). The IgG antibody positivity rate was 46% in the aircrew, 41% in healthcare workers, and 35.3% in the other patient group (p < 0.001).The group with the highest IgG antibody titer is in the aircrew; there was a significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In our study, it was observed that aircrew, similar to healthcare workers, are at serious risk against SARS-CoV-2. In this process, it is suggested that the vaccination processes included repeated doses of aircrew should be accelerated and protective measures and equipment should be increased in terms of reinfection.

AB The clam Rangia cuneata originating from the Gulf of Mexico has recently been introduced in the Baltic Sea waters. In the Polish coastal waters R. cuneata colonized riverine (the Vistula Delta) and the lagoon (the Vistula Lagoon) areas. In the Vistula Lagoon population strong fluctuations in clam biomass and density was observed being a consequence of reoccurring yearly spring mortality. In the present work we examined the condition and general health of R. cuneata from the Vistula Lagoon and the potential role of microorganisms as causative factors of mortality events. Overall, 102 adult clams were collected in March 2019. Out of those, 50 clams were used for microbiological and histological analyses while 52 for biochemical examination. Histological examination revealed that 47 clams were characterized by infiltration of hemocytes in various internal organs with mantle and gills most commonly affected. Observed inflammatory response was morphologically classified as mild to severe infiltrative hemocytosis as seen in severe systemic infections (septicemia) with the latter occurring in 40% of clams. Bacteria isolated from the clam tissues, characterized by a massive growth included those from the genus Aeromonas (A. sohria. A. caviae, A. hydrophila), all classified as potential pathogens. Additionally, the presence of Kocuria spp. (G+) and pathogenic Shewanella putrefaciens (G-) was documented in one individual. Bacteria identified in water samples were almost identical to those from the tissue and included all the three Aeromonas species, S. putrefaciens and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (G+). Grain staining revealed the presence of G(+) bodies in hepatopancreas, while G(-) bodies were often observed in the epithelial tissue of gills and mantle. Biochemical examination revealed the lack of glycogen, low carbohydrate and lipid contents indicating scarce levels of stored energetic materials. Hence, predominant bacteria isolated from R. cuneata together with low energetic reserves may greatly explain poor condition of these clams, and periodical mortality outbreaks occurring in the studied area. We thus hypothesize that the disease outbreak potentially elevating species mortality and affecting its reproduction may limit rangias' success in creating a stable population in some areas with microorganisms forming mechanism participating in ecosystem resistance against introduced species during early colonization of the new environments.

AB Yelloweye rockfish Sebastes ruberrimus in the Puget Sound/Georgia Basin (PSGB) region are genetically differentiated from those of the outer Pacific coast of North America, while canary rockfish S. pinniger show no population structure between these regions. These characteristics helped determine each species' status as a distinct population segment (DPS) under the US Endangered Species Act. Here, we explore larval dispersal patterns and test whether these patterns could explain the differences in population structure. We used a 3-D oceanographic model to simulate dispersal of each species' larvae from sites inside and outside PSGB for up to 120 d. Dispersal patterns were similar across species and site-specific. Most larvae were found in the same DPS region or management basin from which they were released, but dispersal across boundaries was greatest from release sites nearest the DPS boundary for both species. Dispersal of larvae into the DPS from release sites outside the DPS increased and retention of larvae within the DPS increased with increasing pelagic larval duration, but this was also influenced by a simulated ontogenetic shift in larval depth distribution. The proportion of cross boundary dispersal observed for both species was likely high enough by Day 90 to allow gene flow across boundaries, which is consistent with the lack of population structure observed in canary rockfish but conflicts with the differentiated population structure observed in yelloweye rockfish. Understanding the potential larval dispersal pathways within and across management boundaries is an important step in the successful spatial management and recovery of important and protected species.

AB Vegetation is a good indicator that can help better manage and conserve nature. It is also essential for characterizing habitats that represent an essential component of European nature conservation policy, especially within the Natura 2000 network. However, identifying plant communities is a complex operation partly because of the lack of available tools to identify them accurately. This obstacle is particularly noticeable when we talk about diverse plant communities like meadows. This study aims to develop an expert system to apply formalized classifications of Atlantic estuarine wet meadow community types in the Natura 2000 site 'Estuaire de la Loire'. The tool we created automatically assigns vegetation plots to the units of the French vegetation typology. It allows us to ensure the classification of the European habitat types (EUNIS and the Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) with 91% accuracy. This expert system was applied to a dataset of 1898 vegetation plots from the study area. It allowed us to link 718 vegetation plots to 4 habitats of wet meadows including the habitat of community interest 1410 'Mediterranean salt meadows (Juncetalia maritimi)'. Using this approach, we have also defined the characteristic species of these habitats at a local scale. This tool enables the fast, objective and replicable identifications of wet meadows which are necessary to map or monitor the habitat type (sensu Habitat Directive). The method applied in this study can be easily adapted in other sites and for other habitat types.

AB 1. Fire and herbivory are fundamental top-down processes, structuring grass-tree ratios in ecosystems across a diversity of climates. Both are plant consumers that can strongly control the recruitment of woody seedlings and saplings to taller height classes. Without consumer control, many grass-dominated ecosystems would convert into woodlands or forests. While extensively studied in savannas, few have explored the effects of these disturbance regimes on woody recruitment under temperate conditions.
   2. We exposed saplings of five common European tree species to fire and herbivory in a full factorial experiment in a savanna-like wood-pasture. After 3 years, we evaluated the effects of fire and herbivory on tree sapling survival and height increment. The tree species used, varying in traits and in expected response to fire and herbivory, were Scots pine Pinus sylvestris, Norway spruce Picea abies, European oak Quercus robur, Silver birch Betula pendula and Small-leaved lime Tilia cordata.
   3. Fire and herbivory had a negative effect on sapling survival for all species except for Q. robur, which was not affected by fire. Both processes reduced height increment of B. pendula, while only herbivory reduced the height increment of P. sylvestris and Q. robur. At the same time, B. pendula and P. sylvestris had some of the highest increments, together with P. abies, which had unaffected height increment in all treatments. T. cordata, on the other hand, had a negative height increment across all treatments. Overall, the combined effect of fire and herbivory was similar to the effect of herbivory alone on both survival and height increment, indicating no additional effect of fire when herbivores were present.
   4. Synthesis. Our experiment showed how fire and herbivory can strongly affect the recruitment of European temperate tree saplings on a wood-pasture, potentially leading to comparable consumer control described for ecosystems elsewhere (e.g. savannas). Two strategies to deal with fire and herbivory were identified: tolerance (Q. robur) and avoidance (P. sylvestris and B. pendula). We conclude that both fire and herbivory may have been important drivers of structure and species composition in open ecosystems in temperate Europe in the past.

AB Turbidity [nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU)] monitoring is of great interest to water quality stakeholders. Traditional monitoring programs are limited in time and space, are expensive, and do not reflect the true extent of NTU. In contrast, remote sensing data are able to model the NTU, to monitor its spatial expansion, and are cost-effective. Models developed are usually a single-based function. This study presents a simple machine learning-based Regional hybrid model (R-HM) for NTU retrieval. The R-HM allows prior recognition of the NTU level concentration (high or low) before estimation. The calibration step highlighted that low and high NTUs are sensitive to different spectral regions, but mainly controlled by the red part. Validation was satisfactory with R-2 = 0.99, although high NTUs tend to be underestimated (BIAS = -14%). Landsat (LS) NTU products derived from R-HM were found to be only sensitive to turbidity, even under conditions of high algal blooms.

AB In coastal waters, nutrient supplies originate principally from allochthonous sources, such as inputs from rivers, estuaries or oceanic waters. Recently, it has been suggested that marine life contributes to the nutrient load, with penguin colonies being the largest contributor worldwide. This study aimed to quantify the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) produced by the largest colony of African penguins Spheniscus demersus, which is located in South Africa, using a bioenergetics model (GUANO). We modelled the fate of N excreted and measured potential effects on the physicochemical parameters of the waters surrounding St Croix Island, Algoa Bay, as well as on local primary and secondary productivity. A total of 58.66 (SD 14.99) tonnes (t) of N and 4.35 (SD 1.20) t of P were estimated to be produced by penguins annually, a magnitude comparable to that exported by permanently open estuaries in Algoa Bay. However, only 8% of penguin-produced N washed into the ocean (after moderate to heavy precipitation) as total ammoniacal N, while 58% of N was excreted as volatilised ammonia. Consequently, penguin excreta appeared to have limited influence on productivity in the waters surrounding St Croix Island, at both proximate (200 m) and distant (2 km) locations. Additional experiments should confirm whether the input of N excretion in coastal waters was too ephemeral to be detected at the monthly scale, or whether the effects were restricted to intertidal communities. Regardless, sources of nutrients other than penguins, such as coastal upwelling and runoff, are likely to have a greater influence on the physicochemical dynamics and productivity of Algoa Bay nearshore waters.

AB This paper is devoted to a type of combined impulsive discrete Beverton-Holt equations in ecology when eventual discontinuities at sampling time instants are considered. Such discontinuities could be interpreted as impulses in the corresponding continuous-time logistic equations. The set of equations involve competition-type coupled dynamics among a finite set of species. It is assumed that, in general, the intrinsic growth rates and the carrying capacities are eventually distinct for the various species. The impulsive parts of the equations are parameterized by harvesting quotas and independent consumptions which are also eventually distinct for the various species and which control the populations' evolution. The performed study includes the existence of extinction and non-extinction equilibrium points, the conditions of non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions for given finite non-negative initial conditions and the conditions of asymptotic stability without or with extinction of the solutions.</p>

AB Invasive non-native species are important drivers of ecosystem change, yet the driving forces of biological invasions themselves are poorly understood. Such information is essential to ensure policies focus on the most relevant drivers, and that future scenarios capture the full range of potential outcomes for invasive non-native species. I carried out a bibliometric analysis of articles published from 2000 to 2020 that address either invasive non-native species or biodiversity and ecosystem services and that also mention 1 or more drivers of ecosystem change. I examined 5 indirect drivers (demographic, economic, governance, sociocultural, and technological) and 6 direct drivers (climate change, invasive non-native species, land-use or sea-use change, natural hazards, pollution, and resource extraction). Using the Web of Science core collection of citation indexes, I undertook searches of article titles and keywords and retrieved 27,462 articles addressing invasive non-native species and 110,087 articles dealing with biodiversity or ecosystem services. Most research to date on biological invasions as well as on biodiversity and ecosystem services has focused on anthropogenic direct drivers of ecosystem change rather than indirect drivers. Yet currently, less than 18% of articles addressing biological invasions examined drivers of ecosystem change, a similar level to that found over 20 years ago for biodiversity or ecosystem services. Knowledge of the drivers of biological invasions is limited, emphasizes tractable drivers over those that require an interdisciplinary approach, and is biased toward developed economies. Drivers generally deemed important for biological invasions, such as governance and resource extraction, accounted for less than 2% of research effort. The absence of a systematic understanding of the forces that drive invasive non-native species and how they interact means that attempts to mitigate or forecast biological invasions are likely to fail. To address biological invasions requires a much better orientation of national and international research on drivers in relation to both their actual importance as well as their policy relevance.

AB Barnacles are less common in rock pools of the rocky intertidal zone than on open rock surfaces adjacent to those pools. Rock pools on the Andaman coastlines of Thailand showed diurnal variations in water temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen level, peaking in the afternoon. Multivariate analysis showed that water temperature and salinity (not pH and dissolved oxygen) can affect barnacle abundance in rock pools. The present study tests the hypothesis that a lack of recruitment or pool environmental conditions (continuous submergence, water temperature, and salinity extremes) affect the abundance of barnacles (Chthamalus malayensis and Amphibalanus amphitrite) in rock pools. During the recruitment season, recruits were found in a number of rock pools, but at significantly lower abundances than those in adjacent open rock surfaces. In a laboratory experiment, C. malayensis and A. amphitrite that were continuously submerged had a lower survival (80%) than the controls (simulated tide conditions; >90% survivals). Under different water temperature and salinities treatments, barnacles had low survival (<50%) in the low salinity (0 parts per thousand) and high temperature treatment (40 degrees C). The present study suggests that C. malayensis and A. amphitrite can recruit into rock pools, and the interplay of continuous submergence, high water temperature and low salinity in rock pools can bring about mortality in barnacles.

AB Vachellia karroo (Hayne) Banfi & Galasso (formerly Acacia karroo) is the most widespread tree in southern Africa, and exhibits wide morphological variation such that the phenotypes have been considered as separate species. We sought to determine whether local adaptation was occurring in two neighboring Vachellia karroo populations (ca. 15 km apart) in South Africa that show tremendous size variation as adults. We examined seedling and sapling performance of genotypes grown in reciprocal environments that differ in climatic and edaphic conditions. We used a field reciprocal transplant experiment at Richards Bay and Empangeni, and complemented this with a common garden study. We measured total height, stem diameter, thorn length, leaf area, leaf weight, plant aboveground dry weight and specific leaf area after 4 months and 16 months for common garden and field-grown plants, respectively. For greenhouse-grown plants, root dry weight was also measured. Phenotypes of seedlings and saplings from the two populations maintained their differences in the greenhouse and in the field. Greenhouse-grown plants showed lower proportional root allocation for Richards Bay than Empangeni (i.e. root mass fraction: 0.20 +/- 0.01 vs 0.60 +/- 0.02). In the field, there were significant genotype-by-environment interactions for two of the seven performance traits for reciprocally transplanted populations. We found limited evidence for local adaptation that is attributed to variation in edaphic conditions. Local adaptation was evident in two leaf traits (leaf area and leaf dry weight) that showed a genotype-by-environment interaction. These two traits clearly have important fitness consequences for photosynthesis. However, plants from one population grew taller and had longer thorns at both sites. We conclude that the magnitude of divergent selection in the two populations is relatively low and may be accompanied by processes such as genetic drift, leading to limited local adaptation and genetic differentiation.

AB Anti-predator mechanisms play a key role in the survival of any animal in nature. Anurans exhibit a great diversity of defensive behaviours and interact with the widest range of predators of any vertebrates. However, there are few systematic and experimental studies of anuran defensive behaviours, which are generally opportunistic. Here, we deploy a range of methods to investigate various facets of anuran defensive behaviour using the cane toad Rhinella marina as a model organism. This originally Amazonian anuran is now widely distributed across the globe and has caused several predators to decline at introduction sites where this species is not native, a direct result of its anti-predation defenses. First, we compiled previously published data on anuran predation events to assess the relationship between predator/anuran size and predator size and type. We then performed a systematic experiment to test the hypothesis that there is an ontogenetic variation in cane toad behavioural defense displays, as well as a variation in these displays between males and females. In total, we tested 173 individuals including juveniles, adult males and adult females. We show that the size and type of the predator is related to the size of the anuran as prey and that this, in turn, has led to the adoption of different predation-avoiding behavioural defensive strategies during ontogeny. Our results also indicate that both the sex and the size of anurans influence the adoption of defensive strategies.

AB Stopping invasive species early in the invasion process has the potential to save hundreds of billions of dollars and avert damage to agriculture, natural areas, and human health. While urban areas pose particular challenges to early detection, they also present special opportunities. Urban areas and their ports of entry host higher concentrations of invasive species and, with increasing travel and transport, the number of species introduced to urban areas will increase. Along with many invasive species, urban areas contain many citizens interested in being citizen scientists and the potential for taxonomic experts to be associated with major institutions of learning. Early detection is an effective strategy and citizen scientists are effective data collectors. We present a model called Invader Detectives that harnesses existing data collection by citizen scientists to support early detection of invasive species in urban areas. The data-driven approach is being implemented as a pilot project in the metropolitan Washington DC area but we hope to find partners in urban areas across the country to create a nation-wide network of Invader Detective chapters. The Invader Detectives structure is reviewed and lessons learned are reported.

AB The late dry season is a period when forage resources become limited in some African savannas that can induce a strong demographic bottleneck in herbivore populations with limited access to resource heterogeneity. This study determined forage quality and quantity between wetlands and drylands habitats during the late dry season. We subjectively sampled forage characteristics in four habitat types around the distal reaches of the Tsum Tsum floodplains of the Okavango Delta during the late dry season of 2015. The habitat types were mopane and sandveld woodland far from floodplains (two major dryland habitat types), sandveld habitats that receive soil moisture inputs from adjacent floodplains (wet sandveld) and sedgeland habitat within the floodplain. Leaves collected from forage in each habitat type were oven dried, milled and analysed for total nitrogen. Data of greenness, height, biomass and protein were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Forage in wet sandveld had by far the highest protein content (similar to 16%) of all habitat types but forage height and biomass were very low, whereas sedgelands had the highest biomass of adequate-quality forage, while dryland communities had the lowest quantity and quality of forage. Thus, foraging between a higher-biomass, adequate-quality reserve resource (sedgeland) and a high-quality but low-quantity bridging resource (wet sandveld) can help to ensure a balanced protein and fibre intake during the late dry season. Our study demonstrated the importance of wetland habitats for providing green forage with sufficient biomass and protein to sustain herbivores over the late dry season.

AB This research aimed to determine the impact of coal mining on the variety of plants and their successional dynamism in the Guinea savanna. Five sites in Nasarawa State, Nigeria, were sampled: abandoned sites (36 years post-mining), actively mined sites C and D (for two years), and one control site, E. To evaluate its diversity and species composition, alpha diversity (species richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices), beta diversity, and indicator species studies were employed. There were 74 plant species observed throughout the study, but 55 showed a significant connection with the locations. Control site E contained the most significant proportion of native, perennial, and nitrogen-fixing plants, indicating a high level of alpha diversity. Due to the high OC and accessible N at abandoned site A, it possesses the most significant number of tree species (75%) in the Fabaceae family, indicating ongoing natural succession. Thus, succession in abandoned site A was created based on the microhabitat's interaction with the plant species' eco-functionality. Although extrinsic factors such as grazing and farming delayed successional processes in abandoned site B, the greatest observed beta diversity was linked with the eco-morphological characteristics of rare plant species Boerhavia erecta and Kallstroemia pubescens. Active mining sites C and D had reduced soil nutrients and a greater abundance of invasive annual forb species such as Ageratum conyzoides, Asystasia gangetica, Urena lobata, Sida linifolia, and Mimosa pudica. Therefore, artificial restoration of abandoned coal site B is recommended to expedite the reclamation process.

AB Empirical evidence for increases in the reproductive potential (egg output per unit area) of coral reef fish in no-take marine reserves (NTMRs) is sparse. Here, we inferred the development of reproductive potential in two species of protogynous reef fishes, Chlorurus bleekeri (Labridae: Scarinae) and Cephalopholis argus (Epinephelidae), inside and outside of Philippine NTMRs. We estimated key reproductive parameters and applied these to species-specific density and length data from 17 NTMRs (durations of protection 0-11 years) and paired fished sites (controls) in a space-for-time substitution approach. For C. argus, we also used density and length data collected almost annually over 29 years from a NTMR and an adjacent control at Apo Island. The results suggest that C. bleekeri can develop 6.0 times greater reproductive potential in NTMRs than controls after 11 years of protection, equivalent to approximately 582,000 more eggs produced 500 m(-2) inside NTMRs. Enhancement of reproductive potential in C. argus was not evident after 11 years in the space-for-time substitution. At Apo Island NTMR, reproductive potential of C. argus increased approximately 6-fold over 29 years but NTMR/control ratios in reproductive potential decreased through time (from 3.2 to 2.4), probably due to spillover of C. argus from the NTMR to the control. C. argus was estimated to produce approximately 113,000 more eggs 500 m(-2) inside Apo Island NTMR at the 29th year of protection. Ratios of reproductive potential between NTMR and controls in C. bleekeri and C. argus were often greater than corresponding ratios in density or biomass. The study underscores the importance of species-specific reproductive life history traits that drive variation in the development of larval fish subsidies that originate from NTMRs.

AB Mathematical models are a helpful tool that can help palaeoecology research advance in similar ways as the ones already used in theoretical ecology. In this article, we use a mathematical model based on differential equations to estimate the past Mammuthus columbi population in the Valsequillo Basin, Puebla, Mexico. We calibrated the model based on the biological and etiologic parameters of the African elephant Loxodonta africana. In addition to the mean population, the analysis allows inferring the population dynamics of the M. columbi on the Valsequillo Basin. The model is based on the ecological interactions between M. columbi and its food resource. It was found that the population must have been oscillating before an equilibrium was reached. Several potential scenarios based on on-site food production (grass) are here analysed. It was found that a good efficiency of the M. columbi to find food can lead to recurrent cycles of abundance and famine. In this situation, the M. columbi populations must have emigrate and then immigrate in periodic circles to avoid starvation.

AB The paper presents an attempt to integrate the classical evolutionary game theory based on replicator dynamics and the state-based approach of Houston and McNamara. In the new approach, individuals have different heritable strategies; however, individuals carrying the same strategy can differ in terms of state, role or the situation in which they act. Thus, the classical replicator dynamics is completed by the additional subsystem of differential equations describing the dynamics of transitions between different states. In effect, the interactions described by game structure, in addition to the demographic payoffs (constituted by births and deaths), can lead to the change in state of the competing individuals. Special cases of reversible and irreversible incremental stage-structured models, where the state changes can describe energy accumulation, developmental steps or aging, are derived for discrete and continuous versions. The new approach is illustrated using the example of the Owner-Intruder game with explicit dynamics of the role changes. The new model presents a generalization of the demographic version of the Hawk-Dove game, with the difference being that the opponents in the game are drawn from two separate subpopulations consisting of Owners and Intruders. Here, the Intruders check random nest sites and play the Hawk-Dove game with the Owner if they are occupied. Meanwhile, the Owners produce newborns that become Intruders, since they must find a free nest site to reproduce. An interesting feedback mechanism is produced via the fluxes of individuals between the different subpopulations. In addition, the population growth suppression mechanism resulting from the fixation Bourgeois strategy is analyzed. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biodiversity conservation benefits the sustainability of the environment and also the well-being of humanity. Here we consider the possible importance of biodiversity of resources in limiting disease. With this aim we formulate a dynamical system model for a terrestrial ecosystem that takes into account, biodiversity of resources together with competition among species. The dynamics of the model are explored using appropriate dynamical system analyses. The effects of the competition terms and carrying capacity on the dynamics of the model are considered in terms of which ranges allow sustainability of the system. Simulations illustrate how biodiversity conservation can of itself lead to reduction in infectious diseases in an ecosystem. The sustainability of the environment is generally improved by robust biodiversity and important for human welfare. Diseases and their control are also important in natural and human systems. Here we use models to establish to what extent natural resource biodiversity can reduce the extent of infected resources. Our results show that biodiversity conservation is a possible control mechanism for reducing infectious diseases in an ecosystem. These results can help natural resource manages concentrate time and money on biodiversity conservation over and above the already obvious need for such efforts.

AB Seedling quality is a key factor influencing growth and survival after transplantation, but few studies have evaluated the effect of cultural practices on the quality of seedlings of broadleaf species natives of the tropical dry forest. In this study, we evaluated the effect of irrigation and fertilization on the quality of forest seedlings with potential use for tropical dry forests restoration. A completely randomized design was used to test the effect of two intensities of irrigation and fertilization on the quality of seedlings of Swietenia humilis Zucc, Cedrela odorata L. (both Meliaceae) and Ceiba Pentandra, C.F. Gaertn (Malvaceae) during 75 days in the nursery. The Dickson seedling quality index was significantly different between species because of irrigation (P < 0.05). The root mass fraction differed between species because of the additional fertilization (P < 0.05). Slenderness also differed between species depending on irrigation (P < 0.0001) and fertilization (P < 0.05). The application of additional nutrients significantly increased the diameter of the root neck in the three species (P < 0.05) and the ratio of dry root biomass and area (P < 0.05). The height of the seedlings and the total dry weight of the seedlings was higher with additional nutrients and constant irrigation (P < 0.05) and (P < 0.05), respectively. Our data indicate that the seedlings obtained are of high quality and could guarantee greater post-transplant survival.

AB Background and aims - Five new species of Streptocarpus (Gesneriaceae) are described from D.R. Congo in connection with preparing the family treatment for the Flore d'Afrique centrale.
   Methods - Standard herbarium practices were applied.
   Key results - Streptocarpus malachiticola sp. nov. is related to S. compressus and S. goetzei while S. bampsii sp. nov., S. malaissei sp. nov., S. salesianorum sp. nov., and S. schaijesii sp. nov. are related to S. michelmorei and S. solenanthus. The differences with these species are discussed and distribution maps for the new taxa are presented. An identification key for all known acaulescent species from D.R. Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi is provided. The conservation status of new species is preliminarily assessed. All taxa are range-restricted in Upper Katanga and the assessments are as follows: S. malachiticola: EN B1+2ab(iii), S. bampsii: CR B2ab(iii), S. malaissei: EN B1+2ab(iii), S. salesianorum: CR B2ab(iii), and S. schaijesii: EN B2ab(iii). Streptocarpus malachiticola is found on metalliferous rocks while the remaining species are either epiphytes in gallery forests (S. bampsii) or occur on humid rocks in gallery forests.

AB Post-mining restoration of heathland habitats has met with mixed success. Failures are often ascribed to the complexity of replicating soil conditions: a scarcity of organic matter and microbial symbionts in stored overburden used for restoration is frequently implicated. Nonetheless, systematic investigation of the role of both interventions is lacking. Using a greenhouse trial and a large-scale field experiment within a commercial kaolinite mine site, we explored how the addition of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ErMF) and organic matter influenced the establishment of dwarf ericoid species that characterize NW European Atlantic lowland heaths. Neither intervention had any positive effect on ericoid establishment in field or greenhouse conditions. In the greenhouse experiment, organic matter (from commercial refuse) increased heather (Calluna vulgaris) cuttings mortality, although surviving plants showed enhanced shoot growth when ErMF were added. All field plots were dominated by combinations of grasses, gorse (Ulex europaeus), and bare ground. Establishment of ericaceous plants was remarkably low (<4%) after 3 years and Erica tetralix and C. vulgaris abundance in organic matter (which increased pH) or ErMF treatments was reduced compared to untreated control. Although our experiments suggest that research on soil manipulation treatments is required to elucidate the conditions necessary for heathland establishment, corroboration of our greenhouse trial results in field conditions highlights the value of the former in informing the latter. We identify low pH, high lignin (e.g. pine) litter as one potentially worthwhile soil amelioration treatment and suggest how the use of naturally colonized/preinoculated "nursemaid" plants could facilitate heathland restoration.

AB China's supply-side conservation efforts in the past decades have led to two bewildering juxtapositions: a rapidly expanding farming industry vs. overexploitation, which remains one of the main threats to Chinese vertebrates. COVID-19 was also the second large-scale zoonotic disease outbreak since the 2002 SARS. Here, we reflect on China's supply-side conservation strategy by examining its policies, laws, and practices concerning wildlife protection and utilization, and identify the unintended consequences that likely have undermined this strategy and made it ineffective in protecting threatened wildlife and preventing zoonotic diseases. We call for China to overhaul its conservation strategy to limit and phase out risky and unsustainable utilization, while improving legislation and enforcement to establish full chain-of-custody regulation over existing utilization.

AB Anthropogenically influenced habitats are becoming increasingly impacted by multiple invasive species that can regionally control main ecological processes and functions. Management requires predictions of invasive species' effects, but multiple invasions may cause unpredictable outcomes, for example, synergistic impacts or interactions among trophic levels causing trophic cascades. The Baltic Sea is prone to species invasions that increasingly occur at multiple trophic levels. We used a laboratory experiment to test whether multiple invasive predators may cause interactive effects in the Baltic Sea. In aquaria, we simulated a coastal community that has developed dominated by invasive species-the decapod predators Palaemon elegans and Rhithropanopeus harrisii, the amphipod grazer Gammarus tigrinus, and the filter-feeder Dreissena polymorpha. The orthogonal experiment determined separate and interactive effects from predators on the lower trophic level invasive species and native algae including the foundation species Fucus radicans. The main result was that while both predators significantly impacted the community, in no cases were their effects interactive. Another important result was that P. elegans appeared to cause a trophic cascade, as in its presence F. radicans and its epiphytes had the greatest biomass while G. tigrinus grazers were heavily reduced. G. tigrinus were negatively correlated with F. radicans biomass, so variable amphipod grazing may be the link allowing an indirect effect of P. elegans on F. radicans. R. harrisii also reduced G. tigrinus abundance but did not affect F. radicans biomass. Both predators significantly affected the lengths of F. radicans plant stems that were comprised of new vegetative growth-P. elegans reduced the lengths of new vegetative tissue while R. harrisii increased it. Thus, the presence of P. elegans induced shorter and denser F. radicans bushes compared to taller and thinner bushes observed in other treatments. Lastly, R. harrisii caused significant declines in D. polymorpha numbers. Overall, ecological management needs to consider positive effects from predator invasion which may reduce grazing pressure on low trophic level foundation species. A trophic cascade involving two invasive species highlights the importance of multi-species approaches to management of Baltic Sea invasive species and in other regions prone to biological invasions.

AB Small or isolated plant populations might be expected to provide limited nectar resources to attract or sustain pollinators. We determined whether the plant-pollinator mutualism between the obligate out-crossing ornithophilous species Erica discolor, and its pollinators was resilient to habitat fragmentation. To do this we recorded pollinator visitation rates (using % flowers with at least one visit as a proxy) and seed set in patches of different sizes and degree of isolation in the easternmost section of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. For E. discolor, there was no negative effect of patch size and isolation on visitation rates. Plants in small patches (< 100 ha) did not have lower proportions of viable seeds compared to plants in large patches (> 240 ha). Our findings suggest that conserving small isolated fragments is important in maintaining ornithophilous plant populations. (C) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background The Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India harbours a high percentage of endemic species due to its unique and diverse habitats. These species which cannot survive elsewhere due to their specialised habitat requirements are at high risk from climatic and anthropogenic disturbances. The butterfly fauna of the region although well documented has not been investigated intensively at local scales. In this study, we present information on species presence within 10 km x 10 km grid cells (n= 30; area=3000 km(2)) of 94 butterfly species in the Western Ghats region. The data on the species distribution within these grids which included three wildlife sanctuaries and four forest divisions was mapped. Indicator analysis was performed in R using multipatt function in indispecies package to determine species associated with sites/site combinations. The corrected weighted endemism indices of the study grids were estimated. Results The data collected over a 4-year period comprised of 393 records of 60 endemic species belonging to five families observed along 102 transects. Troides minos was the most widespread species occuring in 19 grids. Seventeen species indicative of sites and site combinations were obtained, of which Cirrochroa thais, Papilio paris tamilana, Papilio helenus daksha, Parthenos sylvia virens and Mycalesis patnia were significant. The highest corrected weighted endemism index was observed in grid 25 (14.44) followed by grids 24 (12.06) and 19 (11.86). Areas harbouring unique and range restricted species were Parambikulam WLS/TR: Kuthirakolpathy, Pupara, Kalyanathi, Top slip and Muthalakuzhy; Peechi-Vazhani WLS: Ayyapankadu; Thrissur FD: Chakkapara and Vellakarithadam; Nenmara FD: Karikutty, Pothumala and Nelliampathy estate; Vazhachal FD: Poringalkuthu dam, Meenchal and Vazhachal. Conclusions The study area which covers 2.14% of the Western Ghats hotspot harbours almost 63.82% of the region's endemic butterfly species making this particular region crucial for butterfly conservation and management. Studying the phylogenetic endemism of the butterflies, identification of microrefugia and testing the mountain geobiodiversity hypothesis with respect to butterflies are the suggested approaches to be adopted for fine-tuning research and conservation of butterflies in this fragile hotspot.

The density of spontaneous establishment of plants neighboring pine stands planted with 35 populations of Pinus spp. (P. caribaea (var. bahamensis and var. caribaea), P. elliottii, P. kesiya, P. merkussi, P. oocarpa, P. patula, P. pseudstrobus, P. strobus, P. taeda, and P. tecunomanii) was evaluated in three locations in the state of Sa similar to o Paulo. The vegetation covers neighboring the pine stands were evaluated regarding native vegetation occupation, open area, and eucalypts plantation. The spontaneous establishment of plants census was conducted up to 100 m away from the pine stand edges; samples were collected over an area divided into four 25 m-wide transects. In each transect, the spontaneous establishment were quantified and classified into three size classes: seedlings (<0.3 m), saplings (>= 0.3 m 1.0 m), and trees ( 1.0 m). The results indicate that Pinus elliottii is the species with the greatest invasion potential in the studied areas. Areas without established vegetation favored regeneration, indicating the effect of the environment on regeneration occurrence. The number of spontaneous regeneration increased near the seed source but decreased significantly between 50 and 100 m away, despite the directional effect of the prevailing winds and the long-distance dispersal capacity of the genus.

AB Hawaii's role as a hub for travel, commerce, and military transport is a major contributor to its vulnerability to invasive species incursions. Ports of entry, airports, and seaports, besides being important invasive species pathways are also sites that present the first opportunity for early detection and rapid response. Mamalu Poepoe is an interagency program to enhance invasive species detection at Hawaii's main airports. The program brings together multiple state agencies including the Hawaii Departments of Transportation, Agriculture, Health, Land and Natural Resources, and the University of Hawaii. The program also collaborates with several projects under the University of Hawaii system such as the Hawaii Ant Lab and the Invasive Species Committees statewide. Priority target species in the program include: mosquitoes, the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB: Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus), Africanized honeybees (AHB: Apis mellifera scutellate Lepeletier), and invasive ants. Mamalu Poepoe fills an important gap in surveillance at Hawaii's airports and enhances the state's ability for early detection and rapid response of species that can severely affect human health, our environment, and the economy through collaborative efforts.

AB Key message The high mortality and low recruitment of the myrmecophytic Acacia drepanolobium are not consistent with the demographic rates of monodominant species. The positive conspecific density dependence observed from the spatial analysis is consistent with the defensive benefits conferred by symbiotic ants to trees when they grow close to each other. Patches of savanna dominated by Acacia drepanolobium occur throughout East Africa on nutrient-rich vertisols, also known as black cotton soils. We assessed the survival and recruitment for all freestanding trees with diameter at knee height (dkh) >= 10 mm in one of such mono-dominated patches (47 ha) at the Mpala Research Centre, Kenya, with the aim of identifying demographic traits that might explain the dominance of this species. Over a mean 6-year interval, mortality and recruitment rates in the habitat were 4.55%/year and 1.42%/year respectively, resulting in a net loss of 17.8% of the initial individuals. Of the 30 species recorded from the first census, 11 decreased in abundance, nine increased, and the remainder 10 did not change in abundance. The monodominant A. drepanolobium had a high mortality (4.69%/year), a low recruitment (1.31%/year), and a 19% population decline. There was no evidence of conspecific negative density dependence for this species. Rather, we found a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of conspecific neighbors and individual-level probability of survival, consistent with the "shared defense" benefits that symbiotic ant colonies occupying multiple trees can confer to these latter in a small neighborhood. Thus, mortality of A. drepanolobium was higher in areas where it occurred in lower densities, which resulted in an increase in the spatial aggregation of conspecifics. Mortality increased with dkh size classes and was mostly caused by elephants and stem-boring beetles. The demographic rates during the study period in theory are inconsistent with those of monodominant species. The protection against herbivory conferred by mutualistic ants associated with this species remains the most probable explanation of its dominance in this habitat.

AB We investigated the presence and ecology of Chirocephalus croaticus (Steuer, 1899) during three successive seasons (spring and autumn 2018, spring 2019) at Lake Petelinje (SW Slovenia). Although the presence (duration, abundance) of this fairy shrimp strongly differs among different seasons and both years, we showed that in a season with favourable conditions (spring 2018) its abundance increases rapidly at the end of the season as the shrimps persist in small pools until the water dries out. The species may appear again during the autumn, however, its abundance and persistence seem to be much lower and shorter than during the spring, respectively. Nevertheless, persistence and abundance may also differ strongly among the two successive spring seasons (less shrimps found during the shorter season of 2019 than in 2018). Larvae appear first, and are most abundant at the beginning of the season, and are followed by adult males (protandry) and females, which become most abundant at the end of the season. Also, larvae seem to be more abundant on exposed bottom (gravel path), while adults are much more abundant in the shelter of a submerged meadow. Ovigerous females had 9-37 cysts (fertilized eggs) in their brood pouch, and the position of differently developed eggs changed during the season; the presence of females without eggs during mid- and at the end of season indicates the production of thin-shelled summer, and thick-shelled winter cysts, respectively. In contrast with the water decrease that is in strongly negative association with the abundance of the fairy shrimps (lake size - abundance: r = -0.56, P<0.001), no other environmental parameters were highly associated ( r <= 0.38|) with species abundance. Although the local population (one of only two currently known) seems to be in good condition, appropriate conservation action should be taken to prevent the decrease of this population in the future.

AB We study optimal two-sector (vegetative and reproductive) allocation models of annual plants in temporally variable environments that incorporate effects of density-dependent lifetime variability and juvenile mortality in a fitness function whose expected value is maximized. Only special cases of arithmetic and geometric mean maximizers have previously been considered in the literature, and we also allow a wider range of production functions with diminishing returns. The model predicts that the time of maturity is pushed to an earlier date as the correlation between individual lifetimes increases, and while optimal schedules are bang-bang at the extremes, the transition is mediated by schedules where vegetative growth is mixed with reproduction for a wide intermediate range. The mixed growth lasts longer when the production function is less concave allowing for better leveraging of plant size when generating seeds. Analytic estimates are obtained for the power means that interpolate between arithmetic and geometric mean and correspond to partially correlated lifetime distributions.

AB Riparian vegetation in the Okavango Delta has extensive economic, social and environmental benefits. However, despite its importance, it is threatened by changes in variation in hydrology, anthropogenic activities, and other environmental conditions. Some riparian vegetation communities may change rapidly in response to both long term and short term disturbances. Long term monitoring of riparian woodland vegetation can help reveal changes in these woodland species, enabling timeous management interventions. In this study we classified, mapped and conducted change detection analysis of the spatial extent of different communities of riparian woodland in the Okavango Delta. Woodland species were identified in the field and their percentage cover estimated. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis in PC-ORD was used to classify woodland vegetation into four communities. These communities were Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana, Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis, Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum and Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe. Multi response permutation procedures (MRPP) was used to test if there was any significant difference in plant species composition between different vegetation communities. MRPP showed that communities varied significantly (p < 0.05) from each other in composition, which may be indicative of the prevailing environmental conditions in the Delta. Landsat data was used to produce land cover maps at 3 time-steps which were then used in the change detection analysis for riparian woodland vegetation. Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum areal extent increased from 1991 to 2019, whilst Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana decreased. The area covered by Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe and Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis was fluctuating over the study period. The results suggest that the Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum community is more susceptible to variations in hydrology whilst the Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis community is more stable. The Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana and Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe communities are also susceptible to prevailing environmental conditions including the hydrology, soil nutrient status as well as the occurrence of elephants in large densities in the Delta and anthropogenic activities. This information will serve as baseline for monitoring of riparian woodland vegetation in the Okavango Delta.

AB The fluctuation of streamflow in snowmelt-dominated watersheds may be an indicator of climate change. However, the relationship between the start of growing season (SOS) and the streamflow in snowmelt-dominated watersheds is not clear. In this study, we update the Coupled Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (CHESS) model by incorporating the Growing Season Index (GSI) module to estimate the start of the growing season. The updated CHESS model is then used to calculate the streamflow in the Cleve Creek, Incline Creek and Twin River watersheds located in Nevada in the United States from 1981 to 2017. This updated CHESS can be applied in any regions that are suitable for deciduous vegetation. The streamflow in the static and dynamic scheme in the three watersheds have been simulated between 1981 and 2017 with the NS of 0.52 and 0.80 in the Cleve Creek, 0.46 and 0.75 in the Incline Creek, and 0.42 and 0.70 in the Twin River watersheds, respectively. The results illustrate that the SOS have come around 3-5 weeks earlier during the last 37 years. The results illustrate a high correlation between the temperature and the timing of the SOS. Early SOS leads to a substantial increase in total annual transpiration. An increase in annual transpiration can reduce aquifer recharge and increase cumulative growing season soil moisture deficit. Comparing to the streamflow without vegetation, the streamflow with vegetation is smaller due to transpiration. As the SOS comes earlier, the peaks of the streamflow with vegetation also come earlier. If the shifts in SOS continue, the effects on annual rates of transpiration can be significant, which may reduce the risk of flooding during snowmelt. On the other hand, earlier SOS may cause soil moisture to decline during summer, which would increase the drought stress in trees and the risk of wildfires and insect infestation.

AB Most research on tropical savanna vegetation has focused on the factors promoting the co-existence of trees and grasses, and competition between savanna trees has received relatively little attention. Northern Australian savannas are amongst the most-fire prone landscapes on Earth and are dominated by a uniquely fire-adapted group of trees: eucalypts. Other northern Australian savanna trees tend to be largely suppressed by frequent fires. We used a root-exclusion experiment in a long-term (ca. 40-year) fire-excluded savanna to investigate the growth responses of juveniles of four dominant savanna tree species, both eucalypt (Eucalyptus miniata and Eucalyptus tetrodonta) and non-eucalypt (Terminalia ferdinandiana and Buchanania obovata), with and without root competition from neighbouring trees. Our results provide evidence of juvenile trees are not subjected to strong competition from neighbouring adult trees, as there was no difference in growth between root-excluded treatments and controls. However, Eucalyptus miniata, a dominant tree species in these savannas, had reduced growth, in terms of both height and diameter, regardless of the root-exclusion treatment. Our study suggests that growth of juvenile trees is not strongly limited by mot competition from other trees. However, our results provide support that fire exclusion favour non-eucalypts by limiting the growth and recruitment of savanna eucalypts. Large reductions in fire frequency and/or intensity may lead to a shift in dominance away from eucalypts in the tropical savannas of northern Australia.

AB This paper synthesizes vulnerability, risk, resilience, and sustainability (VRRS) in a way that can be used for decision evaluations about sustainable systems, whether such systems are called coupled natural-human systems, social-ecological systems, coupled human-environment systems, and/or hazards influencing global environmental change, all considered geospatial open systems. Evaluations of V-R-R-S as separate concepts for complex decision problems are important, but more insightful when synthesized for improving integrated decision priorities based on trade-offs of V-R-R-S objectives. A synthesis concept, called VRRSability, provides an overarching perspective that elucidates Tier 2 of a previously developed four-tier framework for organizing measurement-informed ontology and epistemology for sustainability information representation (MOESIR). The new synthesis deepens the MOESIR framework to address VRRSability information representation and clarifies the Tier 2 layer of abstraction. This VRRSability synthesis, composed of 13 components (several with sub-components), offers a controlled vocabulary as the basis of a conceptual framework for organizing workflow assessment and intervention strategies as part of geoinformation decision support software. Researchers, practitioners, and machine learning algorithms can use the vocabulary results for characterizing functional performance relationships between elements of geospatial open systems and the computing technology systems used for evaluating them within a context of complex sustainable systems.

AB African elephant populations are under substantial anthropogenic pressure, but these are not spatially homogenous. Elephant densities are high in parts of southern Africa, leading to conflict with human populations. Conservationists working to mitigate impacts of human-elephant conflict (HEC) will turn to mechanisms or incentives to achieve this, mostly financial (such as compensation, or income generation through tourism). Little is known about the attitudes of stakeholders' (such as farmers) toward financial incentives used to mitigate conflict. Here we carried out a content analysis of stakeholder evaluative expression, or valence, using reports from the southern African news media. We sourced 428 separate news articles over the past ten years, and quantitatively assessed stakeholder valence on the financial mechanisms used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. We found that stakeholder attitudes or valence differed across countries and that stakeholders were generally positive, even with regard to controversial mechanisms such as trophy hunting. Our work has some implication for conservation policy.

AB Close association of iron mining and ferruginous rupestrian grassland places this ecosystem in a special condition of vulnerability, with a large number of degraded areas requiring restoration. Seedling transplantation and topsoil translocation can be used to recover native vegetation in degraded areas. This study aimed to experimentally test the application of two different topsoil depths (0.20 and 0.40 m) in a degraded area. We assessed the vegetation's natural recovery and the survival of transplanted native species from rescue operations in four 200 m(2) plots established in each topsoil depth. There was no influence of topsoil depth on the plant species survival, while the vegetation cover was greater on the thicker topsoil. However, exotic species with invasive potential contributed substantially to this vegetation cover, requiring management planning. Some planted native species stood out for their survival ability in the topsoil 49 months after planting. Application of 0.20 m topsoil layer showed to be able to provide native species' natural recovery and survivorship.

AB Geographic gradients in plant productivity can present foraging large herbivores with varying resource levels across the range of a population, to which individuals can demonstrate varying intensity of selection. To investigate individually-specific responses of nyala antelopes (Tragelaphus angasii) to vegetation greenness, we monitored the landscape use of eight telemetry-collared adult females, half at the wetter end and half at the drier end of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We used remotely-sensed greenness as an index for plant productivity and data on canopy structure, and we compared the strength of selection for greenness between animals having different greenness averages within their home ranges. We found a decreasing pattern between home-range average greenness and strength of selection, which depended on season and presence of tree canopies. Animals in low-greenness home ranges tended to have stronger positive selection in closed-canopy vegetation in the dry season; those in high-greenness home ranges tended to have the stronger negative selection in open-canopy vegetation in the wet season. Our study emphasizes the possibility that a spatial resource gradient on a landscape might provide a valuable model of temporal change in a resource and an indication of potential for foraging animals to adapt to those changes.

AB Drawing from a historical conservation perspective and political ecology, this review mediates the growing debate on wildlife conservation and hunting, especially in human-dominated landscapes of Africa. The focus is to 1) trace how socio-political changes during and after colonization transformed the hunting and wildlife conservation discourse in southern Africa, and 2) to address how previous conservation injustices were addressed through benefit-based approaches like CAMPFIRE, adopted in Zimbabwe after colonization. Some 144 published journal articles, books and other source materials were consulted. The review indicates that political changes in southern Africa profoundly transformed the conservation and trophy hunting narrative. This narrative had varied impacts and outcomes for different groups of people. Although a number of benefit-based approaches, like CAMPFIRE reflected a complete departure from past conservation policies, they continue to attract praise and criticisms since opinions differ among stakeholders, especially over extractive activities like trophy hunting and its associated benefits. I conclude that political developments impacted on conservation and trophy hunting in a profound way and that although post-colonial, pro-community conservation programs have inherent weaknesses, to a greater extent they addressed past conservation-based injustices. Continuous monitoring and area-specific adaptive management of wildlife and its sustainable management is recommended for long-term conservation benefits and community livelihoods.

ID CORBICULA-FLUMINEA; BELLAMYA-CHINENSIS; ASIAN CLAM; SNAIL; PREDATION;
   CREPIDULA; BIVALVE; ENERGY; CALCIFICATION; AVAILABILITY
AB The organic component of the molluscan shell allows for orderly biomineralization and ensures structural integrity that is crucial to survival. This organic contribution to the shell typically composes 2-5% of the total adult shell by weight. Because macro- and microstructure of the shell is known to vary with ontogeny and across taxa, we examined if the organic to mineral ratio components in shell also varied with growth across taxa. To assess intraspecific differences in the organic to mineral ratio of the shell during growth, we examined ratios in three marine [Crepidula fornicata (Linnaeus, 1758), Littorina littoral (Linnaeus, 1758), and Littorina saxatilis (Olivi, 1792)] and two freshwater [Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) and Bellamya chinensis (Gray, 1834)] mollusks across size ranges. In the marine gastropods, the average organic component by weight of the small size class was significantly larger than the average organic proportions of the medium and large size classes. The smallest size class of L. saxatilis had an average shell organic proportion of 11.12%, while the smallest size classes of C. fornicata (3.53%) and L. littorea (2.60%) had percentages below 5%. The smallest size class of C. fluminea had a greater average shell organic proportion than the largest size class (6.19% vs 2.68% organics). Adult specimens of B. chinensis had an average shell organic proportion of 3.93%, while in utero shelled juveniles had an average of 10.05%. In both freshwater and marine species, the smallest size class had a greater organic proportion. As the organic matrix is energetically more expensive than the calcified shell portion, we hypothesize that energy expended in these smaller (usually pre-reproductive maturity) stages of growth allows for a more rapid production of shell and that this "expense" is a valuable trade-off for the protection the shell offers young mollusks.

AB One key tool to manage fragile ecosystems in arid lands is knowledge of land degradation. For this purpose, field-based soil and vegetation characteristics were related to remote sensing information extracted from Landsat OLI moving standard deviation index (MSDI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) in degraded (watering points and livestock camps) and reference sites of arid rangelands of Iran. Values of spectral indices along grazing gradients at a distance of 50-1500 m from the centre of degradation were also extracted and analysed. Statistical analysis (t-test and ordination analysis) shows that MSDI is a sensitive index of landscape heterogeneity and, unlike other indices, exhibits a significant difference between degraded and reference sites. MSDI was sensitive to grazing gradients around watering points and livestock camps, and declined with increasing distance from these areas, although this varied between different sites due to grazing intensity and characteristics of soil and vegetation cover. Soil analysis showed that the amount of organic carbon, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and soil stability indicator (SSI) at reference sites were significantly higher than those at degraded areas. Ordination analysis confirmed the results of t-test regarding the high potential capability of MSDI in separating degraded areas. This simple and practical index can be used to determine ecological thresholds and investigating rangeland condition in arid ecosystems.

AB Bacteria affiliated to the Deltaproteobacteria dominate intestinal microbial communities in the abalone, Haliotis diversicolor, and may colonize the host's digestive gland, raising the possibility that they contribute to digestion of macroalgae. However, the phylogenetic, and genomic and metabolic characteristics of these Deltaproteobacteria, and the nature of their relationship to abalone host remain elusive. Here, we examined the intestinal microbial composition of H. diversicolor using high-throughput sequencing and described the genomic characteristics of the Deltaproteobacteria phylotype using genome-centric metagenomics. High-throughput sequencing confirmed that one Deltaproteobacteria phylotype was predominant in intestinal microbiota of H. diversicolor. Phylogeny analysis based on full-length 16S rRNA gene allocated this bacterium to a distinct and unique cluster within SAR324. It possessed a genome of at least 1.59 Mb with 35.15 mol% GC content, much smaller than other sequenced free-living SAR324 bacteria. According to genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction, ATP binding cassette transporters for sugars and carbohydrate metabolism pathways indicated heterotrophic potential. Interestingly, it encoded polysaccharide lyases, which, if expressed, could help the host to digest its macroalgae diet. In contrast to the known SAR324, no sulphur oxidation or carbon fixation pathways were predicted. We propose that this is a unique and specific SAR324 bacterium in symbiosis with Haliotis.

AB Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is associated with a compromised myeloid system. Understanding the state of granulopoiesis in a patient during treatment, places the clinician in an advantageous position. Mathematical models are aids able to present the clinician with insight into the behaviour of myeloid-derived leucocytes. The main objective of this investigation was to determine whether a proposed model of ALL during induction therapy would be a usable descriptor of the system. The model assumes the co-occurrence of the independent leukaemic and normal marrow populations. It is comprised of four delay-differential equations, capturing the fundamental characteristics of the blood and bone marrow myeloid leucocytes and B-lineage lymphoblasts. The effect of treatment was presumed to amplify cell loss within both populations. Clinical data was used to inform the construction, calibration and examination of the model. The model is promising-presenting a good foundation for the development of a clinical supportive tool. The predicted parameters and forecasts aligned with clinical expectations. The starting assumptions were also found to be sound. A comparative investigation highlighted the differing responses of similarly diagnosed patients during treatment and further testing on patient data emphasized patient specificity. Model examination recommended the explicit consideration of the suppressive effects of treatment on the normal population production. Additionally, patient-related factors that could have resulted in such different responses between patients need to be considered. The parameter estimates require refinement to incorporate the action of treatment. Furthermore, the myeloid populations require separate consideration. Despite the model providing explanation, incorporating these recommendations would enhance both model usability and predictive capacity.t

AB To determine the impact of musk extraction procedures on the endocrine stress response of farmed male forest musk deer and to improve welfare and husbandry conditions in captivity. In our study we measured the effects of musk extraction and related procedures (capture and restraint) on the stress level of treated individuals by analyzing fecal cortisol concentrations (FCC). Fecal samples were collected from 20 captive musk deer for 20 days prior and 28 days after the treatment. Ten animals were subjected to capture, restraint, and extraction (CRE-treatment), another ten experienced only capture and restraint (CR-treatment), but no extraction. Generally, stress levels observed in the CRE group were significantly higher than those of the CR group. In the CRE group, seven individuals significantly increased, but three decreased the FCC after treatment, while in the CR group, eight individuals increased and two decreased the FCC after treatment. However, the FCC recovery time in the CRE group was significantly longer than that of the CR group. Furthermore, musk deer with higher baseline levels were more likely to decrease FCC after handling. Our results suggest that individual personality, the intrinsic stress level and poor habituation to captivity permanently increase baseline FCC, leading to a sensory adaptation of the HPA axis and therefore to a decreased FCC after CRE-treatment.

AB In recent decades, riparian vegetation has been removed from important ecosystems around the world, in spite of its high ecological importance for aquatic biota. Nevertheless, the effects of catchment land use on zooplankton have been little studied. The present study investigated if replanting riparian vegetation in a tropical reservoir influences the richness and abundance of cladoceran communities, by addressing the question of whether cladocerans show differences in richness and abundance among four levels of riparian vegetation conditions: 1) native forest (NF); 2) 30 years after forest replanting (R1); 3) 10 years after forest replanting (R2); and 4) no forest (No-F). Zooplankton samples were obtained from 9 stations in the Volta Grande Reservoir, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Cladocerans in zones NF and R1 showed higher levels of richness and abundance than in zones No-F and R2. Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Ceriodaphnia laticaudata, and Diaphanosoma spinulosum showed higher abundances in zones NF and R1. Cladoceran community structure was influenced by the different levels of riparian vegetation. This study showed that the presence and age of riparian forest positively influence the abundance, richness and diversity of cladoceran assemblages. Furthermore, our results indicated that C. reticulata, C. laticaudata and D. spinulosum are more efficient than other cladocerans in exploiting allochthonous resources provided by riparian forest. Functional diversity was higher in zones NF and R1, suggesting that the trait composition of cladoceran assemblages responds positively to recovery of riparian forest. Overall, our research suggests that cladocerans are good indicators of riparian vegetation conditions and that restoration of riparian forest positively affects cladoceran assemblages of tropical reservoirs.

AB When an area previously used for agricultural or sylvicultural purposes is abandoned, it may undergo natural regeneration. However, the outcome of such regeneration depends on a number of factors, including the presence of non-native invasive plants, and, when production forests such as eucalypt plantations are considered, remaining non-native trees may also affect the natural regeneration possibilities. We studied how remaining eucalypt trees affect woody species regeneration and invasive grasses in an abandoned Eucalyptus grandis plantation in a regenerating Brazilian savanna site. We sampled the woody vegetation and invasive grasses in 30 8 x 8-m plots and surveyed the eucalypt trees within these plots and in 3 m-wide strips around them. Eucalypts negatively affected the cover of the C4 invasive African grass Melinis minutiflora and the total abundance and basal area of native woody plants in general and of two dominant species, suggesting an overall negative effect on native plant regeneration notwithstanding the also negative effects on African grasses. Conversely, they had no effect on species richness, species diversity nor mean height of woody plant communities nor on the abundance of three other dominant native woody species. Interestingly, a low eucalypt abundance had small effects on native woody species but much stronger effects on the cover of M. minutiflora, possibly due to shading. Thus, our results indicate that remaining eucalypt trees may hamper the natural regeneration of native woody plants, but also suggest that maintaining a low density of eucalypt trees may be a cost-effective strategy, given the high costs associated with the complete removal of remaining trees and the difficulties in controlling invasions by African grasses.

AB The stock markets are an integral aspect of every economy. Over the last few decades, there has been a significant change in Ghana stock market returns (GSE). Our study examines the statistical and economic significance of investor sentiment, based on weather conditions/changes, on stock market returns. OLS models, assisted by unit root tests, were employed in analyzing the data obtained from the Ghana stock exchange platform from 2000 to 2017. From our literature review, we discovered that investors' perceptions play a central role in setting the direction of stock market returns. We tested whether weather variations influence investment decisions of investors; we discovered that temperature and cloud cover significantly influence stock market returns. This is because mood changes are associated with variations in weather conditions. However, as per our regression coefficient, sunshine shows a statistically insignificant impact on investors' investment choices. Our regression analysis also revealed that precipitation, to a large extent, negatively influences stock market activities. Based on our findings, we concluded that stock brokerage firms, companies, and investors (foreign/local) must in corporate weather changes/effects when planning their investment outcomes.

AB Coral reef fishes use a multitude of diverse feeding behaviours to increase their ability to successfully capture a wide range of prey. Here, this study reports a novel hunting behaviour in a coral reef fish, the titan triggerfish,Balistoides viridescens, where an individual was seen partially beaching itself while attempting to catch a Red Sea ghost crab,Ocypode saratan. This is the first report of this behaviour in the order Tetraodontiformes and represents an astonishing capability of this species to exploit food resources outside their typical assumed ecological niche.

AB Subtropical forests face pressure from both rapidly changing climate and increasing harvest activity in southern China. However, the interactive effects of various spatial processes on forests are not well known. The objective of the present study was to answer the question of how forest aboveground biomass (AGB) changes under alternative climate change and harvesting scenarios and to determine whether there will be a tipping point for forest AGB before 2300. Our simulation results show that, although total forest AGB did not reach a tipping point before 2300 under possible climate change and harvesting scenarios, the slope of the total forest AGB showed a decreasing trend around 2100 and 2200. Moderate climate warming was conducive to AGB accumulation, except for in the high emissions Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) scenario. Our results also indicate that timber harvesting is adaptable to the accumulation of biomass under climate change scenarios. Harvesting intensity was a key variable affecting forest AGB more than harvesting frequency. Our findings will help develop more sustainable forest management strategies that can adapt to potential climate change scenarios, as well as determining the effectiveness of implementing alternative forest harvesting policies.

AB Population dynamics and life history traits of the 'giant' limpet Scutellastra laticostata on intertidal limestone platforms at Rottnest Island, Western Australia, were recorded by interannual (January/February) monitoring of limpet density and size structure, and relocation of marked individuals, at 3 locations over periods of 13-16 yr between 1993 and 2020. Limpet densities ranged from 4 to 9 ind. m(-2) on wave-swept seaward margins of platforms at 2 locations and on a rocky notch at the landward margin of the platform at a third. Juvenile recruits (25-55 mm shell length) were present each year, usually at low densities (<1 m(-2)), but localized pulses of recruitment occurred in some years. Annual survival rates of marked limpets varied among sites and cohorts, ranging from 0.42 yr(-1) at the notch to 0.79 and 0.87 yr(-1) on the platforms. A mass mortality of limpets on the platforms occurred in 2003, likely mediated by thermal stress during daytime low tides, coincident with high air temperatures and calm seas. Juveniles grew rapidly to adult size within 2 yr. Asymptotic size (L-infinity, von Bertalanffy growth model) ranged from 89 to 97 mm, and maximum size from 100 to 113 mm, on platforms. Growth rate and maximum size were lower on the notch. Our empirical observations and simulation models suggest that these populations are relatively stable on a decadal time scale. The frequency and magnitude of recruitment pulses and high rate of adult survival provide considerable inertia, enabling persistence of these populations in the face of sporadic climatic extremes.

AB Polypodium hydriformeis a parasitic cnidarian that develops within the eggs of acipenseriform fish in the Old and New Worlds. Currently regarded as monotypic,P. hydriformehas been studied largely in the context of caviar production in Russian sturgeon species. We report the first robust epidemiological study ofP. hydriformein North American acipenseriform fish. We sampled infection prevalences (in 2017 and 2018) and intensities (in 2017) during annual surveys of American Paddlefish,Polyodon spathula,caught during spawning migration in north-eastern Oklahoma. Egg masses were characterized for the presence and intensity ofP. hydriformeinfection. Prevalences were similar in 2017 and 2018 (49% and 45%, respectively). Generally, a small number of eggs were infected per egg mass, but a few were heavily infected. Longer, heavier and older fish are more likely to be infected and to harbour more severe infections. In addition, infection is linked to decreases in roe fat weight independently of fish length, weight, age or roe weight. Infection thus diminishes Paddlefish energy reserves (roe fat) which could in turn impact host fitness. Our results raise questions about the impacts of infection on caviar production and Paddlefish conservation and suggest insights on infection dynamics and parasite strategies.

AB Species richness is an important measure of community and regional diversity, and studying species diversity along elevation gradients is vital to understand population ecology and environment. Pteridophytes are unique groups of vascular plants and are not given much attention toward their diversity along elevation gradients. Hence, we made an effort to study the species richness of pteridophytes along elevation gradients in Kolli Hills, one of the underexplored forests of the Eastern Ghats in India. Elevation gradients were divided into 13 elevation zones, and relationship between species richness and elevation were summarized to linear regression as indicated by correlation coefficients and significance. A total of 98 species of pteridophytes belonging to 58 genera and 32 families were recorded in our study with a maximum number of 29 species in the 1301-m to 1400-m elevation. Correlation between the family, the genus, and species richness with elevation was positively significant. The majority of the recorded species showed terrestrial habitats, and patterns of species richness with life forms exhibited a humped distribution. Species richness on scrub and semievergreen forests with elevation showed humped distribution, whereas deciduous and evergreen forests showed monotonic distribution. Correlation between species richness and elevation was positively significant in scrub forests and nonsignificant in other vegetation types. The correlation of species richness with temperature was monotonic, with rainfall and relative humidity showing a humped pattern of distribution. The high diversity of pteridophyte species in Kolli Hills is due to its richness in various habitats resulting from an extended altitudinal range and a healthy evergreen forest with a constant increase in rainfall in higher elevations. Apart from climate, vegetation, and life form analysis attempted in our study for species richness along the elevation gradients, much attention should be given toward the role of other environmental gradients, which can help us address various ecological questions.

   POPULATIONS
AB Ascertaining the risks and benefits of different behaviors is a central goal of research on territoriality. Although most territorial behavior is ritualized, with concomitant reduced risks for both residents and intruders, this ritualization is generally found to be underpinned by rare, highly consequential, interactions. The agonistic behavior of the intertidal owl limpet, Lottia gigantea, involves defense of a feeding territory, and includes a relatively explosive thrusting response by territory holders against intruding conspecifics. We here ask whether this thrusting behavior is capable of entirely dislodging intruders from their rocky wave-swept substratum, thereby ridding the resident of future challenges by that intruder. Our field measurements of the strength of territorial thrusts, as well as thrust resistance, indicate that territorial limpets are strong enough to overcome the resistance of small to medium sized (<40 mm) conspecifics encountered on their territories. Interestingly, at least 44% of the limpets dislodged from the rock substratum during a retreat or territorial response survived in a new location. Growth of these survivors was at least as rapid as that of undisturbed limpets in the old location. We conclude that shell thrusting during the territorial response of Lottia gigantea can reduce the cost of territorial defense by dislodging smaller conspecifics, thereby eliminating them from all future interactions. Conversely, the risk incurred by these smaller conspecifics while intruding onto territories of larger individuals is likely mitigated by the surprisingly high survival rate, and subsequent normal growth, of dislodged limpets.

AB Breeding turtles in farms for offering them in the food market is a profitable market in Vietnam. Here we study, through structured questionnaires with 73 owners of turtle farms, the social and economic contexts of this business activity. We also collected ecological data for the most intensely bred species, the Wattle-necked softshell turtle, Palea steindachneri. Palea farms were typically small family-owned companies, with just 1 to 4 employees working just 1 - 2 h per day but almost every day in the week, and with 1 to 4 ponds available in the facilities. Sex ratio of farmed turtles was heavily skewed to females in both P. steindachneri and Amyda cartilaginea (the secondly most frequently bred species), and their clutch size was very similar. Inside farms, mating of P. steindachneri occurred in February, egg deposition in March - July with a peak in May, and egg hatching in May - October, with a peak in July. In Vietnam, the typical owner of P. steindachneri farms is a self-made man who had enjoyed very little management and support from government for his/her business.

AB Nationwide aerial animal censuses of Botswana between 1992 and 2012, conducted by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, have highlighted a 71% decline in the national springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) population and a contraction of their range. The reasons for this decline remain unknown. We investigated possible drivers of this decline in the southern Kalahari of Botswana. We assessed springbok resource selection levels, movement behaviour and seasonal and spatial effects on the juvenile:adult female ratio. Springbok displayed high levels of forage and habitat selection. Their dependency on pan habitats renders their distribution predictable, which could expose them to high levels of predation and poaching. Springbok moved shorter daily distances during the hot dry and longer distances during wet seasons. High temperatures during the hot dry season could limit movement and prevent exploitation of spatially and temporally heterogeneous resources. We recorded a ratio of 0.37 juvenile:1 adult female in the wet season months followed by a ratio decline to 0.10:1 in the subsequent cold dry season, indicating a low recruitment rate that could be contributing to the springbok population decline. Environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, will likely exert a negative influence on selective foragers like springbok.

AB In this paper, we propose a methodology for upscaling fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimates derived from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to a larger area using freely available Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat-8 satellite data in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo biome of South Africa. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach is still lacking yet critical for understanding human-environment interactions, degradation, and the impacts of climate change in this vulnerable dryland ecosystem. The proposed approach utilizes ultra-high spatial resolution UAV imagery (i.e. < 5 cm) to develop a high quality FVC product. The resulting product is then used to upscale and validate satellite-based estimates of FVC. The rationale for upscaling UAV estimates to the satellite-scale is not only to cover larger areas but also to exploit historical satellite time-series data, in an attempt to understand past trends and vegetation dynamics in the Nama Karoo-Grassland ecotone. The proposed method is expected to produce the first-ever high-resolution continuous maps of FVC and its changes in the above-mentioned ecosystem. Such information is of vital importance as it could help decision makers to gain a better understanding of the extent at which mechanisms such as bush encroachment, grassland expansion, or degradation are occurring in dryland ecosystems.

AB This study was conducted to determine the relationships between woody plant species alpha diversity (alpha) and environmental factors in Dedegol (Yenisarbademli) Mountain area. The research data obtained from 103 sampling plots after the land inventory study was used to calculate the diversity variables. The coverage area and habitat characteristics of woody plant species in each sampling plot were recorded during the field work. Clustering analysis (CLA) was used to group the sampling plots base on the vegetation data matrix. Correspondence Analysis (CA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) from the ordination techniques were applied in the study to the vegetation matrix in order to determine the distribution degree of the sampling plots on the ordination axis. As a result of the CA applied, surface stoniness was found to be the environmental factor that had the highest correlation. In conclusion, surface stoniness was found to have an important impact on the vegetation distribution. Furthermore, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied at the final stage of the study. In conclusion, Shannon-Wiener was the most effective index to calculate the alpha species diversity while surface stoniness and elevation were the most explanatory variables for alpha species diversity in the study site.

AB High altitude grasslands are frequently within a climatic zone that should support trees, yet trees are absent. Low temperature is often cited as a possible mechanism that excludes trees. We investigated the effect of white frost and black frost on Vachellia sieberiana saplings, possible preadaptation to frost; a possible strategy employed to tolerate frost; and whether seeds of V. sieberiana are viable after exposure to sub-zero temperatures. Seeds of V. sieberiana collected from trees at two different altitudes were germinated and the saplings potted out. Saplings were subjected to simulated white frost and to simulated black frost. Tissue samples from chilled saplings were analysed for soluble sugars in the cell sap. Seeds were also exposed to temperatures between 0 and -9 degrees C and then germinated. V. sieberiana saplings were able to coppice after extensive damage to above-ground tissue as a result of exposure to white frost. However, saplings were unable to compensate adequately in one growing season for the loss of above-ground growth after more than 25% topkill. This may keep saplings within the frost trap leaving them vulnerable to further frost, fire and browsing. Saplings exposed to black frost at temperatures down to -6 degrees C were also able to coppice after damage to aboveground tissue, but prolonged exposure to black frost at less than -6 degrees C resulted in sapling mortality. Saplings grown from seed from a low-altitude site where frost events were frequent exhibited preadaptation to low temperatures, while those grown from high altitude seed experiencing less frost did not. V. sieberiana did not increase soluble sugars within the cell sap in response to chilling stress. The seeds of V. sieberiana are resistant to damage at sub-zero temperatures, maintaining limited viability after exposure to -9 degrees C. Frost and very low temperatures, therefore, limit the establishment of V. sieberiana saplings, but not recruitment (seed germination). Once a sapling has escaped the frost trap, it will be able to establish itself successfully. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although the identification of plant communities is the basic language of communication, studies that focus on the classification of vegetation in successional series are rather rare, mainly because it is difficult to identify different types of vegetation. Thanks to formalized algorithms of machine learning, we were able to assign some of vegetation plots stored in a Database of Successional Series (DaSS) to alliances in the vegetation classification system. Of the samples in DaSS 67.4% were classified into 96 vegetation alliances. Classification of the seral stages was then used to predict optima and intervals of occurrence of 33 main types of vegetation in the first 70 years from the onset of succession. In accordance with general expectations, main types of vegetation were arranged at the time-scale from ruderal and segetal vegetation, across grasslands to shrubby and forest vegetation. Successional optima of particular units of vegetation can be used to roughly predict the successional changes at human-disturbed sites in central Europe.

AB The main goal of this study was to test the effect of the presence of nesting waterbirds on the taxonomic structure (richness, abundance and composition) of macroinvertebrate communities in southern Brazilian wetlands. Macroinvertebrate communities were seasonally sampled in eight intermittent wetlands differing according to the occurrence of nesting colonies of waterbirds (four with the presence of rookeries; four without). The influence of nutrients and water and sediment physicochemical variables on macroinvertebrate communities was also assessed. The community structure of aquatic macroinvertebrates was not affected by the presence of colonies of nesting waterbirds. Rather, macroinvertebrate communities varied seasonally and they were influenced by water-level environmental variables. Richness and composition changed among seasons and were influenced by nutrients and water physicochemical variables. Water turbidity and total dissolved solids influenced macroinvertebrate richness, while water nutrients affected macroinvertebrate abundance. Our results indicate that the lack of effect of nesting waterbirds on macroinvertebrates is possibly due to the variation in the composition of avian species and their reduced population sizes, and in such cases, any effects of birds on macroinvertebrates can be overridden by water chemistry and seasonal changes in intermittent wetlands.

AB Equilibrium between the gastrointestinal bacterial population and the environment is a critical factor for the health of captive aquatic animals. The bacterial enzymes are fundamental for proper nutrition and pathogen resistance in shrimp. Therefore, enzymatic profiles reveal essential characteristics for the selection of probiotic strains that can improve animal development. In this work, we analysed shrimp from a green water system where infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) was present. We isolated transient and intestine resident bacterial populations, characterising eight functional groups through different culture media. To identify each isolated bacteria, we used sequences from regions V6-V8 of the 16S rRNA. To determine viral load of shrimp samples, we used real-time PCR. The number of colony forming units (CFU) was similar between IMNV-infected and IMNV-uninfected shrimps. The growth of transient bacteria was higher than the growth of resident. In general, lipolytic bacteria presented higher frequency and genus diversity than the other functional groups. All groups showed higher frequency among transitory bacteria, except the amylolytic functional group, which was more frequent among the resident. We found two major orders of cultivable bacteria, Vibrionales and Bacillales. The genus Vibrio was predominant among the Vibrionales, while Staphylococcus and Bacillus were the most frequent among the Bacillales. Recorded Vibrionales and Bacillales included pathogenic and beneficial species of high importance for aquaculture. The results presented here will serve as a basis for improving the nutritional and health conditions of Litopenaeus vannamei in green water farming systems.

AB This study examines the effect of a peptide complex extracted from chicken egg yolk on the action of the immune system of kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus, on pathogens as well as changes in environmental parameters. In the design of three independent experiments, we defined the treated shrimp or the control shrimp as shrimp receiving diet with or without peptide complex administration, respectively. In the first experiment, the shrimp were challenged by Vibrio sp. after 1 week of feeding; the results showed that the survival rates of the treated shrimp were 69%. In the other experiments, the shrimp were exposed to low salinity or high temperature to analyze the changes in various immunological parameters. In a low-salinity test, results showed that the total hemocyte count (THC) of the treated group was significantly higher than that of the control group within 24 hr. In a high-temperature test, THC and phenoloxidase activity of the shrimp in the treated group displayed significantly higher values than that in the control group during 48 hr. In short, the administration of the peptide complex was significantly effective in the prevention of disease and enhancement of the tolerance of kuruma shrimp to environmental changes.

AB The prospects and challenges for non-native tree species (NNTS) in Southeast Europe (SEE) were analyzed using a combination of SWOT Analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Preference data from three groups of opinion leaders with extensive knowledge of the silviculture, ecology and impact of climate change on NNTS in SEE (researchers, practitioners and decision-makers) were used. Results revealed that strengths and opportunities for all three analyzed elements outweigh their weaknesses and threats. In the review of silviculture, key strengths and opportunities were identified as high productivity, adaptation to afforestation of degraded lands, gap filling in forest ecosystems after the loss of native tree species, and higher volume growth of NNTS compared to native tree species. Strength-Opportunity (SO) elements related to climate change were found to be adaptive management responsiveness to climate change and increased length of growing period, possibility of better-adapted mixtures with NNTS under climate change, and replacement of tree species that are sensitive to pests and outbreaks resulting from climate change. These results provide important insights into different segments of strategy approach of sustainable management of NNTS in relation to management, silviculture and climate change practices in SEE.

ID COMPETENCES
AB A modern day forester in South Africa assumes a variety of roles that constantly challenge them to remain professionally relevant in a dynamic system including the continuously expanding number of stakeholders that cuts across political, social and economic boundaries. This study is important in understanding how a forester's job has shifted from simply managing trees and forests for timber to managing trees and forests to achieve the interests of various stakeholders and biological ecosystems that are influenced by industry. This research contributed to a global programme involving the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO). The programme addressed the needs of future employers and economic innovators in the field of forestry. A variety of data collection methods were used to complete this empirical research. The research strategy adopted was implementing case studies where students and academic experts from four tertiary institutions were interviewed. A sample of individuals from the forestry sector was also drawn for interviews. The findings from this research provided insight and perspective on the challenges facing tertiary education of foresters in South Africa, such as the subject of the disciplinarity of forestry as a profession as opposed to more interdisciplinary careers where in addition to modules that are grounded in the discipline, other types of natural sciences are also considered in curriculum design. The main conclusions drawn from this study are that a higher level of integration of social sciences in forestry curricula is pivotal to resolving some of the challenges facing the forestry sector, and that in light of programmes whose delivery process is severely restricted by budget constraints, solutions developed jointly between industry and tertiary institutions should be ongoing.

   EVOLUTION; TIME; DIET
AB Whether a species can be defined as 'endemic' or not is very controversial in theoretical terms, because the concepts of 'endemism' and 'area of endemism' remain much debated among scientists. We propose that it is necessary to consider the body size scale of an organism and the breadth of its distributional range if we want to define a given species as 'endemic' or not. Thus, for instance, Madagascar can be an appropriate area of endemism for animals as large and vagile as the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), but it is much too large to be considered an ecologically appropriate 'area of endemism' for small-sized frogs with limited dispersal abilities. Instead, for these small species it is ecologically more appropriate to consider given forest regions within Madagascar as 'areas of endemism'. Therefore, we propose a five-step approach in order to define whether a given species can be considered endemic or not within a set of potential candidate species, and we offer a suite of practical examples (African squirrels, African Artiodactyla and a family of freshwater turtles from the Americas) to elucidate the designated concept. We define the new concept presented herein as 'scale-dependent functional endemism'. The new concept has the benefits of including the 'ecological characteristics' of the target species in the concept of 'endemism' and being easily repeated, because it is based on rather objective criteria.

AB Background: Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) is a widespread allelopathic invasive species in North America, but despite extensive research we do not fully understand how it impacts plant communities. Aims: We tested the hypothesis that A. petiolata facilitates the introduction of additional alien species as predicted by the invasional meltdown hypothesis. Methods: We conducted co-occurrence surveys to compare the numbers of alien and native species in communities surrounding A. petiolata plants with those surrounding an allelopathic native species. We also conducted an experiment to compare recruitment of native and alien species in pots dominated by either A. petiolata or a native species. Results: A. petiolata plots in the co-occurrence surveys had relatively high proportions of bare ground, suggesting habitat modification, plus lower species richness and disproportionately fewer alien species. There was a greater tendency for native species than alien species to establish in A. petiolata pots. Conclusions: A. petiolata does not promote additional alien species, and in fact may be a more effective competitor against alien than native species in North America. This could help explain its invasive success in disturbed habitats, and illustrates the need to consider separately alien and native species when assessing the outcomes of competition.

During survey period prey species were encountered along the transect lines like sambar, chital, Barking deer, wild pig, common langur, Rhesus macaque, Indian gaur, Giant squirrel, pea fowl, Hare and Elephant. In Pre-Monsoon over all 32.7 +/- 4.32SE/km(2) prey population was estimated in Similipal Core division. Simillarly in Post-Monsoon over all 37.3 +/- 2.3SE/km(2) was estimated in Similipal Core division. Continous prey population monitoring is going on in Similipal Tiger Reserve which may indicates the rising of prey populations in the tiger reserve.

AB This study, by applying the Levels of Conflict model, sought to investigate the manner in which human-human conflict (HHC) related to human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in Chapoto Ward in the mid-Zambezi valley, northern Zimbabwe. The focus was on three interrelated levels of conflict, namely disputes, ongoing conflictual relationships underlying disputes, and identity-level conflict. Besides the identification of the above three levels, the model also helped unravel these from each other. Qualitative data collection methods included in-depth interviews with 60 heads of households, interviews with key informants, a focus group session, and document analysis. We found that the conflict between people and wildlife was much more complicated than it seemed to be because it was driven by HHC. These findings support the new line of thinking that HWC should not be viewed as simply a problem between people and wildlife but as a conflict between stakeholders with divergent views over wildlife management.

AB To arrest the ongoing ecological disaster in the country, the government of Zimbabwe implemented the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE). Through the CAMPFIRE programme, each ward could benefit from two land uses - agriculture and wildlife. The ward must make a choice on land uses, in other words how much land to allocate to wildlife and how much to agriculture. When a hunting area belongs to one ward, the outcome is desirable; whereas if it belongs to two wards, it becomes complicated. We modelled the two scenarios: Scenario 1 - hunting area belonging to one ward; and Scenario 2 - hunting area shared by two wards. We used Pontryagin's maximum principle to solve the models analytically and to carry out comparative statics. We also applied the results to the study areas using secondary data. The results from the analysis suggest that there is a need to make it mandatory for communities who bear the cost of wildlife management to share in the revenue from wildlife.

TI Habitat associations of hawkfish: depth, distribution, and density at
   two sites in Kenya
SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CORAL-REEF FISHES; SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; RECOVERY
AB Hawkfish (Actinopterygii: Perciformes: Cirrhitidae) are a family of carnivorous, coral-dwelling fishes. Some of these have been identified as obligate coral-dwelling, facultative coral-dwelling, substratum-dwelling, or water column-dwelling, depending on the species and habitat. Research on hawkfish density and habitat associations has been conducted in the Atlantic, Pacific, and the eastern and central Indian oceans. However, little is known about the density or habitat associations on the coast of East Africa. This study investigates distribution and density patterns of hawkfish species off Kenya, as well as relationships with available coral habitats, at both shallow (< 5 m) and deeper (5-15 m) coral reef sites. In addition, habitat associations of the two most abundant hawkfish species of the same genus [Paracirrhites arcatus (Cuvier, 1829) and Paracirrhites forsteri (Schneider, 1801)] are identified. Findings showed species-specific macrohabitat associations, whereby higher densities of P. arcatus were found on deep reefs, and higher densities of P. forsteri were found on shallow reefs. In addition, P. arcatus showed a positive association with the hard-branching coral Pocillopora. However, as there was less Pocillopora on the deep reefs, P. arcatus does not prefer the deep reefs simply because there is more Pocillopora present, lending support that these species are facultative coral dwellers. The increased density of hawkfish on deeper reefs could be an indication of mesopredator release, as the study's deep reef locations were within national reserves, which are open to some types of artisanal fishing, reducing the number of apex predators.

AB Chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD), characterized by low-intensity but high frequency, is a major driver of environmental degradation in developing countries. CAD is a mixture of disturbance sensu stricto (DSS), that is, plant biomass removal and stress that reduces biomass production due to changes in environmental conditions. However, we still lack data on the separate effects of both components and their interaction in nature. We analyze the demographic effects of DSS and stress on two grass species in an area heavily affected by livestock raising (a widespread cause of CAD) during the last 500year. We compared areas exposed to DSS and stress with areas without grazing but that continue experiencing a gradient of stress. Using matrix and integral projection models, we analyzed DSS and stress effects on population growth rates () of two grass species and determined the relative importance of different vital rates and states for the change on . Disturbance and stress affected different individuals and processes. For example, changed conditions due to stress increased seedling mortality, but DSS reduced size (growth) of large plants through grazing. CAD had highly nonlinear and species-specific effects on population size structures, and elasticities. Such complex behavior is seemingly due to changes in the components of CAD as it intensified and synergic interactions between disturbance and stress. Given CAD's multivariate nature, these results are not surprising. Nevertheless, grouping this multitude of factors into two broad categories, namely DSS and stress, may prove a useful conceptual tool for analysis.

   PATTERNS
AB The present study was aiming at describing the feeding ethology and assessing surface sediment reworking together with associated effects on sediment characteristics and aerobic bacterial community composition by the ampharetid polychaete Melinna palmata, which exhibits very dense populations in the Arcachon Bay (French Atlantic coast). There was a plasticity in the main aspects (i.e., positioning of the tube at the sediment-water interface, stretching of the worms outside their tubes while feeding, location and mechanism of faeces production) constitutive of the current knowledge regarding feeding ethology in ampharetids. On average, worms dedicated 84.6% of their time to the prospection of surface sediments and produced faeces exclusively at the water sediment interface, which resulted in surface sediment reworking and induced the zonation of surface sediment in three distinct areas, namely: undisturbed sediment, prospected and faecal mound areas. Average individual surface prospected area and surface sediment reworking rate were 28 cm(2) and 6.8 mm(3).h(-1), respectively. Surface sediments were coarser and their bulk organic contents were lower in prospected areas, intermediate in faecal mound areas and higher in undisturbed sediments. Oxygen penetrated deeper in the sediment column in faecal mound areas. Aerobic bacterial community composition associated with surface oxygenated sediments within these three areas also significantly differed, which suggests that sediment reworking per se (i.e., irrespective of changes in redox conditions) do have an effect on those compositions. These results are discussed in terms of potential food limitation in the very dense populations of M. palmata present in the Arcachon Bay. It is suggested that the high densities of these populations result from both hydrosedimentary fluxes due to tidal currents and from the enhancement of particle sedimentation in Zostera noltei meadows.

AB We evaluated the recruitment of plant species and their relation with edaphic attributes in a mine revegetated with sewage sludge in the Brazilian Federal District. Plant species in the revegetated mine and in remaining portions of Cerrado (savanna) within the mined landscape were sampled and identified. Then, samples of revegetated substrate and soils from Cerrado portions were collected, analyzed for chemical attributes and submitted to statistical tests. Results indicated that the remaining portions of Cerrado were colonized by 91 species (22% allochthonous species), and the revegetated substrate housed 62 species (55% allochthonous species). Multivariate tests showed that the edaphic condition built from the incorporation of sewage sludge into the mining substrate acted as filter on the assemblage of plant species. Despite the two study sites shared the same landscape, the Cerrado portions and the revegetated substrate did not share similar plant communities after a decade from mine rehabilitation works.

AB Traditional explanations of tree-grass coexistence in African savannas are based on competition between these growth forms or demographic bottlenecks of trees maintained by fire or mammalian browsers. Perturbation of their balance may result in an alternate system state of woody encroachment. Invertebrate herbivory has never been offered as an explanation. We developed a consumer-resource model which illustrated that annual irruptions of a lepidopteran (Imbrasia belina), known as mopane worm, can determine the tree-grass balance of semi-arid Colophospermum mopane savanna in southern Africa. Model performance was sensitive to the abundance, hence mortality, of mopane worms, owing to their complete defoliation of tree leaf biomass resulting in altered competitive relations between trees and grasses. Invertebrate herbivores have been recognized in other systems as agents for effecting a state change of host tree populations; this modeling study offers a first indication of such a role for the well-researched tree-grass relations of African savannas.

AB Evaluation of woody vegetation changes with distance from a salt crater was conducted in the semi-arid rangelands of southern Ethiopia. Data on live woody plants were collected over three seasons at 0, 1, 4, 6, 9 and 12km from the salt crater. The density and diversity of woody plants differed significantly (p<.01) along the distance gradient. Six woody plant families were identified of which Fabaceae and Burseraceae were the dominant families. Acacia drepanolobium, Acacia nilotica, Commiphora africana and Acacia mellifera were among the severely encroaching woody species. There were high proportions of seedlings and saplings recorded closer to the salt crater showing a vigorous recruitment by woody plants. Woody plant encroachment along the 12-km transect ranged from a low to severe encroachment, which could be translated into poor rangeland condition. Changes in soil characteristics increased grazing pressure and sedentary settlement around the salt crater, and the breakdown of traditional institutions seems to be major contributing factors to these vegetation changes. We suggest that severely encroached areas could be improved through a combination of methods such as bush clearing, prescribed fire, browsing animals and proper grazing management.
   Resume Nous avons realise une evaluation des changements de la vegetation avec la distance par rapport a un cratere salin dans les etendues semi-arides du sud de l'Ethiopie. Nous avons recolte des donnees sur des plantes ligneuses vivant a 0, 1, 4, 6, 9 et 12km du cratere salin. La densite et la diversite des plantes ligneuses differaient significativement (p<.01) le long du gradient de distance. Six familles de plantes ligneuses ont ete identifiees, parmi lesquelles les Fabaceae et les Burseraceae etaient les familles dominantes. Acacia drepanolobium, Acacia nilotica, Commiphora africana et Acacia mellifera comptaient parmi les especes ligneuses les plus gravement envahissantes. Il y avait de fortes proportions de jeunes plants et d'arbustes plus pres du cratere, ce qui montre un recru vigoureux de plantes ligneuses. L'envahissement des plantes ligneuses le long des 12km de transect allait de faible a severe, ce qui peut se traduire par un etat mediocre de l'habitat. Les changements des caracteristiques du sol, une pression plus intense du paturage et les installations permanentes autour du cratere salin, ainsi que la disparition des institutions traditionnelles semblent etre les principaux facteurs de ces changements de la vegetation. Nous suggerons d'ameliorer les zones les plus gravement envahies grace a une combinaison de methodes telles que l'elimination des broussailles, un regime de feux volontaires, l'introduction d'animaux qui mangent ces broussailles et une gestion correcte des paturages.

AB Invasive terrapin species have a major impact on freshwater ecosystems, threatening the endangered species Emys orbicularis. In addition to the widely introduced Mauremys leprosa and Trachemys scripta, new exotic species from the genus Graptemys and Sternotherus are being released in the environment. Furthermore, basins where native and exotic terrapins co-occur have been invaded by the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. In this work we investigated diet breadth and degree of trophic overlap for one native and four exotic species. Additionally, we aimed to explore the potential of native and exotic terrapins to feed upon C. fluminea. Comparisons among two known E. orbicularis populations were performed to determine if long term co-occurrence with C. fluminea leads to an adaptive feeding behaviour. Our results suggest diet overlap and strong kinematic differences among native and exotic terrapins, with greater feeding capabilities and a competitive advantage for the exotic species. In this regard, the opportunistic behaviour of exotic species contrasts with the adaptive pattern of the native species. Based on our findings, we speculate about three plausible terrapin responses to C. fluminea invasion.

AB Ant occupancy in thorns of Vachellia (Acacia) karroo (Hayne) Banfi and Galasso was examined along the banks of the Great Fish River near Grahamstown, South Africa. Half of all thorns with visible openings contained ant nests. Colonies of Tetraponera emeryi (Forel) and a single unidentified Tapinoma species were present in over 40% of thorns with openings. Cataulacus intrudens (Smith, F.) was regularly encountered but at a much lower frequency. A single nest of Tetraponera natalensis (Smith, F.) and two Nesomyrmex stramineus (Arnold) nests were also found. The size of contiguous patches of A. karroo was not related to the percentage of thorns occupied by ants. The A. karroo ant assemblage appears to be mediated by the availability of suitable nesting thorns rather than competitive interactions.

AB The farming sciences are an academic link between sociology and ecology. Currently, there is a prevalent technocratic perspective intended to increase both the productivity and the efficiency with a strong instrumental and operative drive in order to cope with many complex problems. This way some other aspects have been put in the background, even though they should be considered when dealing with the rural development and sustainability. The paper aims to discuss on the role of the farming sciences as an academic link useful to cope with social-environmental problems and the tensions arising in the preservation of rural ecosystems and the territorial development.

AB We present a study of behaviors, belonging to the domain of emotions, inquiry, persuasion and the use of information and that are deployed in time by teams of students immersed in learning processes. These are transformed into time series on which non-linear dynamics techniques are applied, obtaining the connectivity for each team. From this value and the quotient Positivity / Negativity (referred to the emotions) can be characterized learning dynamics and its performance. The Lyapunov coefficients, calculated to the time series, make it possible to obtain the Kolmogorov entropy. From this value, associated to the experimental time series, the complexity of the system and the loss of information are deduced. This allows us to construct, for the learning process, a quantitative estimate of sustainability.

TI The relationships between beta plant diversity and climatic variables: A
   case study from Kuyucak mountain district
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Beta plant diversity; Biodiversity components; Mediterranean region;
   Environmental factors; Kuyucak mountain
AB Aim: There are three types of biodiversity, i.e., alpha diversity (diversty within an individual habitat orecosystem), beta diversity (between habitat or ecosystem) diversity between areas) and gamma diversity (total diversity). Alpha diversity indices have been frequently used to examine the relationships between biodiversity and environmental factors. However, studies concerning the relationships between beta diversity and environmental factors are few despite the fact that beta diversity gives more information about ecosystem stability against internal and external threatening factors. The present study was carried out to examine beta plant diversity and climatic factors in Kuyucak Mountain District of the Mediterranean region.
   Methodology: Bioclimatic data was obtained from www.wordclimdata.org for the district. Bioclimatic variables having cell size 752x752 m were storied in the GIS. Four sample plots were taken in each selected cell by controlling from GIS. Coverage values of plant species were recorded in the sample plots. After field survey, beta plant diversities of the cells were calculated by using Whittaker Beta Index ((3w). Next, regression analysis was applied to show the relationship between beta diversity and bioclim variables.
   Results: Beta diversity showed positive linear relationship with BIO1, BIO2, BIO3, BIO5, BIO8, BIO9, BIO10 and BIO15, while it had negatively linear relationships with BIO4, BIO11, BIO12, BIO14, BIO17 and BIO18.
   Interpretation: Further studies can be conducted about the other climatic variable in the region, as well as the other environmental variables in order to associate with beta diversity. Thus, potential distribution areas of the plant species and biodiversity components can be identified and mapped with the help of base maps for the area's habitat variables.

AB Estimating animal abundances in small areas is a difficult task and because a limited number of observations often results in low-precision estimates whose inaccuracies may even be exacerbated if surveys are focussed on clustered populations and/or are only carried out once a year. In an attempt to overcome this problem, we used point transects to monthly survey two small areas of a game reserve to assess the density of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra p. pyrenaica). The coefficient of variation :associated with the density estimates after pooling observations by season was still high but decreased to reasonable values (<20%) when observations were over 29 chamois groups (clusters). Our results suggest that Distance Sampling may be a useful way of estimating the population density of mountain ungulates such as Pyrenean chamois in small rugged areas where only a small or moderate number of observations are to be expected.

AB The south coast of Java Island is comprised of rocky beaches and tidal flats that are habitats for hermit crabs. One of these is Calcinus elegans, which has high economic value as an aquarium ornament, with a greater potential for Indonesian income from export trading. These organisms have an important role in their ecosystem as detritus and scavengers. This study was conducted to determine the genetic population of C. elegans based on sequences of COI mitochondrial DNA. Fifty-four samples of Garut, 43 of Yogyakarta and 47 of Banyuwangi populations were successfully amplified using universal primers LCO 1490 and HCO 2198. Gene diversity and nucleotides are not significant among populations, while genetic diversity among populations was interpreted by shared haplotype. The number of shared haplotypes among the three populations is 12 haplotypes with 90 samples included with a proportion 62.5% from all samples. This shows that there are large interactions among populations. This interaction is indicated by haplotypes, polymorphic sites, and heterozygosity. The Banyuwangi population has a lower intensity interaction than the others. However, the three populations come from one ancestor.

AB Extirpation of invasive plants does not always result in successful restoration of native plant communities because it can alter ecosystem function or promote further incursion of other invasive plants. To test whether seedlings of native plants can become established without extirpating invasive plants, we evaluated the survival and growth of seedlings of a native tree species, Schima mertensiana, planted under closed forest dominated by an invasive species, Casuarina equisetifolia in the Ogasawara Islands, an oceanic archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. The initial establishment of S. mertensiana is inhibited by the highly accumulated litter of C. equisetifolia; therefore, few seedlings and saplings of S. mertensiana were observed in the forest. We planted seedlings of three initial size classes, and their size parameters (diameter at ground level, height, and number of leaves) were monitored for 69 months. More than 75% of the planted seedlings survived during the study period. There were no significant differences in the number of surviving seedlings among the initial size classes. Steady growth of seedlings was observed regardless of initial size class. Our results indicate that planted S. mertensiana seedlings can survive and grow in forests without removing C. equisetifolia, and provide a case study that shows that planted seedlings of a native woody species can establish under a closed canopy dominated by an invasive woody species, at least for several years.

DT Article

ID EVOLUTION; DISPERSAL; PHYSICS
AB Migration is a key mechanism for expansion of communities. In spatially heterogeneous environments, rapidly gaining knowledge about the local environment is key to the evolutionary success of a migrating population. For historical human migration, environmental heterogeneity was naturally asymmetric in the north-south (NS) and east-west (EW) directions. We here consider the human migration process in the Americas, modelled as random, asymmetric, modularly correlated environments. Knowledge about the environments determines the fitness of each individual. We present a phase diagram for asymmetry of migration as a function of carrying capacity and fitness threshold. We find that the speed of migration is proportional to the inverse complement of the spatial environmental gradient, and in particular, we find that NS migration rates are lower than EW migration rates when the environmental gradient is higher in the NS direction. Communication of knowledge between individuals can help to spread beneficial knowledge within the population. The speed of migration increases when communication transmits pieces of knowledge that contribute in a modular way to the fitness of individuals. The results for the dependence of migration rate on asymmetry and modularity are consistent with existing archaeological observations. The results for asymmetry of genetic divergence are consistent with patterns of human gene flow.

AB With the rapid growth of the urban population and quick expansion of urban dimensions, the affecting urban development constraints of urban carrying capacity has increasingly been attracting people's attention. However, the effective synthesization of urban resources carrying capacity, urban environmental carrying capacity, economic carrying capacity, society carrying capacity and traffic carrying capacity hardly acted as an urban comprehensive carrying capacity evaluation system. In this paper, the novel comprehensive index system of urban resources carrying capacity, urban environmental carrying capacity, economic carrying capacity, society carrying capacity and traffic carrying capacity was used for analyzing and evaluating urban comprehensive carrying capacity. Firstly, the standardization of evaluation index was constructed in the urban comprehensive carrying capacity index system. In addition, the past decade data from 2002 to 2011 was analyzed and evaluated in the weighted index system. Finally, the influence mechanism of various carrying capacity factors on urban comprehensive carrying capacity was investigated in Lanzhou. Experimental results can be summarized that the variation tendency of urban comprehensive carrying capacity was the annual increase of levels and the promotion countermeasure was put forward with congenital restricting factors and acquired restricting factors.

AB Long term monitoring of population estimates and trophy size trends is needed to ensure that trophy hunting is sustainable. We explored the influence of trophy hunting on population size and trophy quality of impala (Aepyceros melampus), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and sable (Hippotragus niger) antelopes from 1997 to 2014 in Cawston Ranch, Zimbabwe. Population estimates of the three species showed a cyclical declining trend, albeit statistically not significant for the three species. Hunting pressure had no significant effect on the population estimates of the three species for the period 1997-2014. Impala population declined (-30 %) between 2003 and 2008 possibly due to increased illegal hunting associated with land invasions during this period. Trophy size of all species declined over time, 2004-2014, (impala (-1.3 %), greater kudu (-3.9 %), sable (-2.6 %)) possibly due to diet quality and loss of genetic variability in these populations. However, trophy size for greater kudu and sable were within the minimum score range of the Safari Club International. We recommend research on genetic variability and inbreeding levels of hunted populations in closed ecosystems to inform adaptive management of trophy hunting as a sustainable conservation tool in small isolated parks in Africa.

AB The distribution of livestock grazing is a key principle of range management. This study examines pastoralists' perceptions of the factors that affect the distribution of livestock in the rangelands of the Neqab region of the Kashmar County in north-east Iran. Data were collected from the pastoralists on their perceptions of the managerial, biological and physical factors that influences the distribution of livestock, using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Results showed that, the perception of the majority of pastoralists was that the distribution of livestock was 'average' or 'good' in the study area. It was perceived that the experience of herders and the size of the rangeland were the main factors influencing the distribution of livestock. Regression analyses showed that it was perceived that managerial factors had a more important role than biological and physical factors in the distribution of livestock and the proper use of the rangelands in north-east Iran.

AB To understand the relative importance of density-dependent and density-independent factors on plant fitness, we examined the effects of local densities and surrounding ground surface conditions on the reproductive output of a monocarpic biennial plant, Lysimachia mauritiana var. rubida in a natural population. Observations were conducted during five successive years in open dry habitats on rocky coastal cliffs of the subtropical Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, Japan. Local density and ground surface conditions, categorized by gravel size, were remarkably heterogeneous in the study population. Therefore, we hypothesized that number of flowers per plant was affected by local density, ground surface condition, and their interaction. During 3 of 5 years, the number of flowers per individual L. mauritiana var. rubida plant was only negatively affected by the local density around the plant. The interaction effects of local density and ground surface conditions were observed in two years. Taken together with the results of previous studies, these results suggest that density effects are dominated survival in the early growing season and reproduction, while the effects of ground conditions are important for seedling recruitment and survival in the late growing season. Thus, interactive effects between density-dependent and density-independent factors on the life cycle from germination to reproduction regulate populations of L. mauritiana var. rubida in spatially heterogeneous habitats.

AB Cancer - uncontrolled cell proliferation, is caused by the deregulation of key genes that control cellular mechanisms, including division, differentiation, apoptosis, and movement. Here, we introduce LogisticCrypt, a logistic model on crypt structure at specific time points, which focuses on cell division, differentiation and apoptosis rates and on cell competition in crypt space. Comparative analysis of time-intervals for occurrence of the crypt phenomena is performed with respect to deregulation in intestinal cell number between the colon and small intestine crypts, obtained during cancer initiation and when carcinogen influence applies.
   Results are found to be more variable for the colon crypt, compared with the small intestine crypt, suggesting that the former is more sensitive to alterations in stem cell division rate than the latter. In addition, significantly higher carcinogen impact on crypt dynamics is evident in the colon crypt, compared with the small intestine crypt: cell proliferation time was observed to decrease by factors of 13 and 4.50 respectively, compared to situations when only the progenitor compartment was affected.

AB The effects of diking on the photosynthetic rate, gross glucose production, biomass, and nutrient levels of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans L., were investigated during the major dry, the major wet and the intermediate season in completely diked mangrove areas, and compared to partially diked and non-diked biotopes. In the major dry and major wet seasons, the photosynthetic rate and gross glucose production were two to five times lower in the completely diked sites compared to the partially diked and non-diked habitats. The average dry weights of branches, flowers and leaves did not differ significantly between sites. The same held true for propagules from the major dry and major wet season. However, propagules from the transition period collected in the non-diked and partially diked biotopes yielded appreciable amounts of dry matter, while plants in the completely diked forests did not carry any propagules. No statistically significant differences were found among nutrient content in the leaves of plants from the different habitats. Our results suggest black mangrove growing in diked habitats may suffer a certain degree of environmental stress, which may affect important biological processes, such as photosynthesis, gross glucose production, and propagule formation.

AB This paper presents modeling approaches for wildlife conservation in a semi-arid savanna setting where there are frequent occurrences of drought. The model was used to test the extent to which wildlife income offers opportunities to reduce fluctuations in income as a result of variations in annual rainfall. For the application of the model the wildlife and agro-pastoral systems of southeastern Zimbabwe were simulated. Results show that wildlife income has the potential to compensate for some of the losses in expected income from livestock during droughts. However, wildlife income becomes second best to irrigated agriculture in stabilizing income in areas that show highly fluctuating rainfall. Possible reasons for this include high costs of exploiting the wildlife resource, and the small fraction of wildlife revenues received by households and communities. In order to search for sustainable solutions in areas such as the southeastern low veld of Zimbabwe, it is also important to be aware that the current human population and livestock densities are far above current sustainable levels. Our results therefore suggest that current and future efforts to conserve biodiversity are doomed to fail if there are no efforts made to decongest areas surrounding parks of high densities of human and herbivore populations, and to let local households earn more revenues from wildlife.

AB Many studies have shown that physical environmental factors cause phenotypic diversity in limpets. However, no studies have documented how substrate conditions (surface shape and topology) affect adhesive force and how they regulate shell morphology in limpets. The intertidal limpet Patelloida pygmaea, having a flat shell, is found exclusively on oyster shells, while P. conulus, with an extremely high shell, is found on Batillaria cumingi. The adhesive force on the B. cumingi was significantly greater in P. conulus than in P. pygmaea, whereas the force on the oyster shell showed no significant difference between these species. On the B. cumingi, a significantly positive correlation was found between adhesive force and volume in P. conulus, and no significant correlation was found in P. pygmaea. In contrast, on the oyster shell, a significant positive correlation was found between adhesive force and volume in both of the two species. These results suggest that the shell of P. conulus becomes higher with increasing own shell size by keeping aperture area relative to body size as small as possible. These morphological differences are most likely due to an adaptation to utilize different habitats and adhere to substrates with different structure and topology.

AB The Ruvubu National Park, the biggest protected area and biodiversity refuge of the country, is comparatively less studied than western Burundi near Bujumbura, the capital. This article reports the results of a botanical inventory of the vascular plants from the protected area, evidences species newly encountered and establishes a comparison of the floristic diversity with the Akagera National Park in Rwanda located in the same phytochorion, in the Lake Victoria regional mosaic. Records from the Ruvubu include 522 species (including infraspecific groups) from 96 families and 306 genera, representing nearly 17% of the known vascular plants of Burundi. The most common families were the Fabaceae, the Asteraceae and the Poaceae. 96 species or 18% of the flora were encountered for the first time in the park. Study of environmental determinants of Leguminosae abundance and floristic variability would provide more precisions.

TI Phytosociology of the farm Haribes in the Nama-Karoo biome of southern

SO KOEDOE
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION; CLASSIFICATION; RAINFALL
AB Limited historic vegetation data (prior to the 1980s) are available for Namibia. Finding such historic data at Haribes prompted a follow-up survey of the vegetation. We present a classification of the recent data in this paper as a first step towards comparing the two data sets. Six new associations (three with two subassociations each) are formally described. The landscape at Haribes is dominated by a pan with surrounding hummock dunes. The pan supports the Lycio cinereum - Salsoletum, whilst on the hummock dunes the Salsolo Tetragonietum schenckii can be found. The surrounding plains and escarpment can be divided into three landforms: the torras with the Monsonio umbellatae -Boscietum foetidae, the ranteveld with the Acacio senegal - Catophractetum alexandri (and two subassociations) and calcrete ridges with the Zygophylo pubescentis - Leucosphaeretum bainesii. Dry river beds on the farm support two subassociations of Anthephoro pubescentis -Ziziphodetum mucronatae. The area covered by each dominant landform has been calculated after being mapped. The composition and diversity of the associations are briefly compared to other known vegetation descriptions within the Nama-Karoo. Since November 2011, Haribes has been used as a resettlement farm. This may result in the overutilisation of the limited grazing resources, to the extent that the present, fairly dense Acacio senegal - Catophractetum alexandri of the ranteveld is feared to become degraded to resemble the Monsonio umbellatae - Boscietum foetidae of the torras.
   Conservation implications: This paper describes six plant associations of the Nama-Karoo biome in arid southern Namibia. The information presented forms a baseline description, which can be used for future monitoring of the vegetation under altered land use.

AB An agroforestry trial was conducted at an ex-tin mine located at Tin Tailings Afforestation Center at Bidor. 'Sugarloaf' pineapple (Ananas comosus), the fruits of which are in high demand in the market, was planted in untreated sand tailings (control), or sand tailings amended with good mineral soil, oil palm mesocarp fiber or mineral soil and mesocarp fiber. At 18 months after planting pineapple plants grown in mineral soil treated plots had significantly greater leaf length and total leaf area than plants in the other treatments. Growth of plants in plots treated with mesocarp fiber was not different from those grown in mineral soil alone or on sand tailings (control). Plants grew significantly better in both mesocarp treatments than they did in the control plots. The results indicate that sand tailings treated with mesocarp fibers alone is more cost-effective as transportation of soils is an expensive endeavor in site preparation for pineapple growing.

DT Article
DE timber plantations; exotic species; indigenous species; nature; cultural
   representation
ID BIODIVERSITY
AB Industrial timber plantations, which cover some 100 million hectares around the globe, do not have a universally positive image. How they are perceived depends on cultural representations of the nature. In the West, the most prevalent representation of nature is of a world untouched by human hand. However, this Western conception differs from those of peasant communities in the tropics, where the idea of a domesticated natural world that can satisfy people's vital needs is much more readily acceptable. Their rural populations, for example, are attracted to naturally fast-growing species, like eucalyptus. Concerning the silviculture, there is also some ambiguity in the idea of "imitating nature", which occurs in different ways depending on whether the imitation is obtained by anthropogenic forcing or by simply giving nature a "helping hand". Urban populations and environmental NGOs have a negative image of industrial plantations, which they usually see as far removed from their own conception of nature. The Western view also tends to accentuate the division between native and exotic species, although it is obvious that this relies on an overall consensus on arbitrary thresholds line. Unfortunate examples of plant species described as "miracle plants" only deepen the division. But industrial plantations are also a form of monoculture, often negatively perceived as promoting biological and even cultural uniformity, and thus conflicting with the positive norm of diversity. It is important to consider these plantations as hybrid objects whose dual biophysical and sociocultural dimension needs to be placed in context. It is suitable to accept that views on plantations of exotic species can reflect diverging representations of nature.

DT Article
DE history; introduction; eucalyptus; reforestation; Madagascar
AB Documentary research has enabled us to reconstruct the history of Eucalyptus introduction in Madagascar from 1857 to 1889, well before any State forest agencies were established. Several eucalyptus species were introduced from different countries by various players, but at the time, the identification of seed provenance was never specified. The reasons for introducing these species were, in particular, to drain malaria-infested wet-lands, stabilise roadside embankments and provide ornamental and street trees in towns. Subsequently, the initial plantations were used to mark out property boundaries, produce timber in the treeless Imerina and Betsileo highlands in the centre of the country and, a little later, to produce fuel for steam engines. Madagascar's ecological conditions promote rapid fruiting in Eucalyptus species, and seeds were harvested as early as 1895 for the Water and Forests department's reforestation programmes. The resulting 150,000 hectares of Eucalyptus stands are now threatened by climate change, mainly because of worsening droughts that will affect their productivity and consequently the resources and incomes of smallholders in Madagascar's uplands. These Eucalyptus trees are of unknown origin and may well have a narrow range of genetic variability. Research would therefore be necessary to test hypotheses on the evolution of characteristics favoured by exogenous factors.

The results showed that, compared with the control, growth of Lolium perenne was stimulated when it was treated with II, the pigment content in leaves, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in the activated oxygen metabolism system increased slightly, while malonaldehyde (MDA) content and produce velocity of O-2.(-) decreased. While the growth of Lolium perenne was inhibited with the increasing proportion of copper tailings, and the relationships between the two points were significantly correlated, which was manifested by the appearance that the pigment content in leaves decreased. Besides, the membrane penetration, electric conductivity, produce velocity of O-2.(-) and MDA content of leaf cells all elevated obviously. Furthermore, the activated oxygen metabolism system was destroyed and the activities of SOD, POD and CAT decreased significantly with high content of copper tailings.

AB Jaguar (P. onca) tracks can help in different studies on big felid research. However, tracks can be confused with those of pumas (P. concolor) making it difficult to determine priority areas. There has been some attempts to obtain a formula to differentiate between the two species however this can be time consuming and requires some experience. We propose the use of a computer based image processing system in order to facilitate studies with these species. A set of 44 footprints from jaguar (23) and puma (2 1) was obtained in Sonora.
   These footprints were used to generate a program based in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that uses two shape descriptors (a boundary based orientability measure and boundary length) to classify the footprints. From the existing data set, the GLM was able to classify the footprints with an accuracy of 75%. A larger data set is expected to increase the classification accuracy. Additional shape descriptors may be added for further improvement. This will provide a method of easy access to carry further studies at a really low cost.

AB Effects of cow manure vermicompost on plant growth and microbial populations in rhizosphere of two species, white clover and alfalfa, were evaluated as they were added into iron tailing under greenhouse conditions. Germination rate, survival rate, height, fresh weight, dry weight and microbial populations in rhizosphere of 20-old-day seedlings of two species were analyzed under four concentrations, as 0% (control), 5%, 10%, 20% by volume, of cow manure vermicompost(CMV) in iron tailing. White clover and alfalfa had different responses to cow manure vermicompost under four concentrations as grown in iron tailing. The germination rate of white clover grown in 20% cow manure vermicompost was significantly more than that of grown in iron tailing with 5%, 10% cow manure vermicompost and iron tailing control(0%). The survival rates of white clover grown in iron tailing with 5%, 10% and 20% cow manure vermicompost were 40%, 48% and 53% higher than that of grown in iron tailing control(0%), respectively. The height of white clover grown in vermicompost was significantly greater than that of control, and the more vermicompost the higher plant height. The shoot weight of white clover including fresh and dry weight with vermicompost was significantly greater than those of control. Their dry weights of root with 10% and 20% vermicompost were greater than that in control. As to alfalfa, the germination rate in 10% vermicompost was greater than that of control. The germination rate with 20% vermicompost was significantly less than that in control. There was no significantly different in survival rate of alfalfa grown in vermicompost than of control. The heights of alfalfa with 10% and 20% vermicompost were shorter than that of control. The shoot fresh weight of alfalfa grown in 20% vermicompost was more than that of control. While their fresh weight of root with 10% vermicompost was less than that of control. The two species, both white clover and alfalfa, can stimulate the microbes in rhizosphere, and the more cow manure vermicompost, the more cultural bacteria and actinomyces in rhizosphere of plants grown in iron tailing. It can be concluded that the cow vermicompost can significantly promote plant growth(especially white clover) and improve the microbial environment in rhizosphere of two species as they were applied in iron tailing restoration.

AB Understanding the implications of sampling effort on biodiversity measures is important where conservation planning takes place in areas with patchy collecting coverage. This study analysed plant diversity data (i) to explore the effect of sampling effort on biodiversity measures at a landscape level and (ii) to test the usefulness of perennial plant data as indicators of biodiversity trends and patterns. Using published sources, databases and own field surveys, plant distribution data from ten grids (15-min intervals of a latitude-longitude grid) in the Sperrgebiet in the Succulent Karoo Biome in south-west Namibia, which were surveyed repeatedly, were analysed. Species-survey curves, simple biodiversity measures and ordination were used to test the effect of sampling intensity on biodiversity measures and floristic relationships. With well over 350 plant species, grids that contained mountainous terrain emerged as the most species-rich. Based on species-survey curves, only two grids were well collected. Floristic relationships showed different patterns with incomplete data, but patterns of perennials were almost identical to those with near complete data. Sampling effort affected community measures more than broad patterns of species richness and diversity in the arid succulent karoo. In reasonably species-rich areas, even if there was only medium collecting status, trends such as the ranking of poor to rich areas were maintained. This also holds for using perennials or endemics as indicators. Floristic relationships showed higher sensitivity to the completeness of sampling. Thus, while species-rich areas (biodiversity hotspots) are also likely to be identified with incomplete data, floristic relationships may be wrongly depicted, when incomplete data are used. Repeated samplings, even if only the perennial components of the vegetation can be recorded, yields more representative results. Perennial plants thus provided a suitable indicator for floristic relationships at the landscape level in the arid succulent karoo.

AB To study the relations between the transportation development and ecological environment may has the vital significance to the transportation long-enduring development. The domestic and foreign research about transportation development ecological carrying capacity has been mentioned when studies the region ecological carrying capacity, on which hasn't specially concentrated research. The paper elaborates the implication of the city transportation development ecological carrying capacity, unifying the definition and the characteristic of ecological carrying capacity. In view of the city transportation development actuality, the development of urban transportation system is divided into five subsystems. The system dynamics analysis method has been carried on the structure analysis to the city transportation development ecological carrying capacity. Simulation software "Vensim" is used to analyze each subsystem and get the feedback loop. Then SD equation of each subsystem is established. Finally, in example analysis, applying the relevant statistical data in Wuhan city to the SD equation, the ecological carrying capacity development tendency of each subsystem is simulated. The research would have a referenced role to the city transportation coordinated development within the scope of the ecological carrying capacity.

AB The reproductive and foliage status of forest trees that are important elephant fruit sources were monitored from July 2001 to June 2002 in the Kakum Conservation Area, Ghana. Phenological events were variable among and within species. Generally, drought conditions triggered leaf shedding while rains induced leaf flushing. Also, rainfall in the wet season was related to the amount of fruits available for elephants in the dry season. However, the best climatic predictor of fruiting was minimum temperature.

ID LOBSTER
AB The Joint Pipeline Project (a 100-mile natural gas pipeline) located in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts has recently been constructed. The route includes a crossing of the Piscataqua River, which forms a portion of the border between Maine and New Hampshire. Installation of the pipeline occurred by horizontal directional drill (HDD) under the river. During permitting of the project, the contingency plan identified open cut construction (dredge and blasting) if the drill failed. The need for mitigation of potential open cut impacts arose during discussions with regulators. The very high velocity reversing tidal flows were of special concern. To develop appropriate mitigation, an analysis was undertaken to determine the probable nature and extent of impacts to biotic resources should an open cut occur. Potential impacts to eelgrass, finfish, lobsters, and shellfish were quantified using hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling in conjunction with biological survey data. Numbers of target organisms and area of eelgrass beds that might be affected by an open cut were determined. Between 0.8 and 1.3 acres of eelgrass loss was predicted. A loss of 27,500 lobsters and 800,000 shellfish (3 species) was predicted from direct impacts. Impacts to finfish were limited to indirect effects on larvae, which could not be quantified. Pipeline installation was successfully completed with the HDD with no adverse impacts to Piscataqua River habitats.

ID COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIRDS
AB We attempted to test biogeographic hypotheses proposed for the evolution of tropical faunas (e.g. refuge, fiverine barrier, and environmental gradient theories) by applying the most widely used molecular approach, i. e. mitochondrial DNA sequencing, to selected African mammalian taxa (Insectivora, Rodentia and Primates). First, we constructed a molecular phylogeny of taxa we intended to use for phylogeographic studies, in order to ascertain their monophyly and to calibrate a molecular clock for divergence time estimates. Second, we analysed and compared the phylogeographic patterns of four forest-dwelling small mammal species and one primate super-species. Third, we evaluated the evolutionary processes potentially involved in the speciation of cercopithecine Primates, by testing their geographic mode of speciation and reconstructing evolutionary scenarios of some life-history traits.
   Our phylogenetic results confirm that gene history is not necessarily the same as organism history. Thus, mitochondrial DNA should be studied in combination with other independent data, such as nuclear genes, morphology, ecology and behaviour. The obtained phylogeographic patterns all differ one from the other, which may be explained by differences in initial distributions, or by different responses to the same events. However, individual patterns present a certain degree of consistency with the faunal areas defined for the central African forest. They indicate a role of Plio-Pleistocene vicariance events in the intra-specific diversification of small mammals and suggest that genetic divergence would be much older than the last glacial cycles. In the case of cercopithecine Primates, speciation would have been predominantly allopatric and driven by Miocene and Pliocene vicariance events. Taken together, our results give support to the refuge hypothesis, without excluding the riverine barrier nor the paleogrographic hypotheses. They emphasize, the role of paleo-ccological changes in generating diversity and that of the main riverine barriers in shaping the present distribution of that diversity.

AB Applicability of the theory of optimal foraging to food selection and feeding specialization in Amphibia is discussed.  The different modes of prey detection may lead to similar tendences in selective foraging.  These depend on species and age peculiarities in neuroethology and morphophysiology.  The diet choice could not be fully explaned in terms of optimal foraging concept.  A possible exception may be the preference of animal food by anuran tadpoles.  The main evolutionary forces in the formation of feeding specializations are specialuzation by habitat, morphophysiological constraints, and reproductive strategy.  The lack of the feeding specializations in the most amphibian species is supposed to be important for their use of narrow adaptive zone.
